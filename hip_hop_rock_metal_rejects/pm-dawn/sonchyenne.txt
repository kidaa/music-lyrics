Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind and all of my lifetimes with you
Dayglow, talk to me about rainbows and all of my lifetimes with you
Earth's Church, tells me I've no worth nor any of my lifetimes with you
But you said you'd show me, all the different sides to you I'll try and understand you
'Cause when you're lied to like I'm lied to all that can connect you is your love
Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind and all of my lifetimes with you
Bright skies, you cry like I cry in all of my lifetimes with you
Light Be, everything inside me through all of my lifetimes with you
But I fear they've no idea, all the other minds in you thinking thoughts for you
When you live not like they do all that can connect you is your love....your love
Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind, and all of my lifetimes with you
You cry like I do, show me what its like in you, 'cause I know why they hate you
When you know one more than they know then all that can connect you is your love
Sonchyenne, tell me about mankind and all of my lifetimes with you
