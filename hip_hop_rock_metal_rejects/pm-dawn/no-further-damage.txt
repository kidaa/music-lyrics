Tell me what I'm to do
I'm trying to find you
But I don't know your ways
And baby you don't love your life
Contentions kill the days for trying it your way
So I don't find it fortunate to be loving you this much this way
All you fears and reasons in time will conquer you
But there's no further damage living in love
When asking for the answers, time will torture you
But there's no further damage living in love
Happiness hurts the sun for foolish reasons
But if you hate me so much then...
Tell me why you're terrified to cry
So tell me you love me too
And finally I get to be you
But in your present state
Baby we can never unify our minds
Why can't I protect you from all the things that hatred does
It's making me feel guilty for living in love
When asking for the answers, time will torture you
But there's no further damage living in love
I saturate my anger with all the love I can muster
Which makes me rich in all hypocrisies, but to celibate to life
So you can have all the fun
And I'll tell you the reasons why...
I don't find it fortunate to be loving you this much this way
Why can't I protect you from all the things that hatred does
It's making me feel guilty for living in love
When asking for the answers, time will torture you
But there's no further damage living in love
All you fears and reasons in time will conquer you
But there's no further damage living in love
When asking for the answers, tell me why...
I don't find it fortunate to be loving you this much this way
