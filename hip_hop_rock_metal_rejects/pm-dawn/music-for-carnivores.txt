You'll hear tales 
of all the great pretenders
then it comes to you...
You'll spend hours
practicing your smile
then it comes to you...
You'll be do deceived by
";The peaceful life";
but You'll spend all your worth
trying to be an angel
and then it comes to you
They don't feel the way you feel
they don't know that they hurt you
and when you forgive them for what they do
you get nothing
You will dream
all there is to dream
then it comes to you...
And when you're overwhelmed by
how apathetic we are
you'll feel powerless
as you crucify your patience
then it comes to you...
They don't feel the way you feel
they don't know that they hurt you
and when you forgive them for what they do
you get nothing
And I'm not afraid
