Destiny paints the picture at about 9:45, I possess the image at about 10:15
Reality paints the picture at about 5:25, and I'm like ";How much sugar do you take in your dreams?";
So I practice complicity around 9:45, yeah that's right, yeah that's right....Unending
Life, are you in my mind? Are all my dreams mine? Wake me up at 9:45
Life, do you believe in time? Do you love your life? Wake me up at 9:45
Destiny writes direction at about 9:45, I receive the visions at about 10:18
Reality drives perception 'till about 5 after 5, and I'm like ";Angels always saturate your schemes";
So I practice complicity around 9:45, so I dream, yes I dream, so infinite.
Life, are you in my mind? Are all my dreams mine? Wake me up at 9:45
Life, do you believe in time? Do you love your life? Wake me up at 9:45
Here's your chance to be unstable, here's you rchance to be unsatisfied,
Here's your chance to dream just like me, realizing we've been fantasized
No need to Christianize me, no need to antagonize my life,
No need to actualize me, ";Cause you've just been bitten";
Destiny sings redemption at about 9:45, I can hear the symphony around 10:19,
Reality stops the music at around 5:59, and I'm like ";You can't change the volume in my dreams";
So I practice complicity around 9:45, existing...Infinite...Limitless...
