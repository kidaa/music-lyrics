oh la la la...
He who thinks, thinks for himself
A woman on trip, is a hit for the mind
a true composer's hell between tears
or PM Dawn makes cause for rewind
Megaline drops along upon a thought
A comatose nap might snatch a sandy
I'm so great I amaze myself
Explains, just how vain is vanity
The longest journey is based on a trip
But also starts with a single step
Because PleasantValley Sunday is 
a grain of salt
But ";now or never's"; a bit hard to accept
Doncha' think?
Problems of the world, lovers, girls, and things of that nature bound
to break my heart
They all show different sides of me, they're all wrapped
up inside of me...
I feel certain awe for/but those who fall to find out they're in the 
shadows in the stars
Even from a watcher's point of view.
Yo...the world doesn't pay for what a person knows
And rarely wants to pay for what a person does
But those who care show puzzle and stare
Singin ' what it is, is what it was
Cause he who learns the rules of wisdom
without transforming it to daily life
is a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife
All this twists and spins in a whirlwind
And spots the mask as to where it remains
on the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on the positive plane
Doncha' think?
Power to the world, Lover's gold, and bees and nature?
not to break my heart..
They all shrunk off inside of me, they're all wrapped
up inside of me...
I feel certain ?, of those who fall upon got the ring of shadow of
my heart
? But these are the watcher's point of view...
Reality and Death be they accompany life
Eternity and Judgement accompany death
The simplest thing to remember, really....
Clog the fog of ";my forget";
Certain little mystery upon mankind lies
certain arrogance, to the unexplained
Pure imagination is based on fact
Showing the confusion is made to contain
But the true defintion of the phrase is a dream
A dream that encloses a question mark
The end of an era in the halls of a mind
That should've been watched and clocked from the start
Doncha' think?
Power to the world, Lover's gold, and bees and nature?
not to break my heart..
They all shrunk off inside of me, they're all wrapped
up inside of me...
I feel certain ?, of those who fall upon got the ring of shadow of
my heart
? But these are the watcher's point of view...
Maybe they just wanna twist my finger
Maybe they just wanna break my arm
Maybe they just wanna try and stop me
Maybe they just wanna do me harm
Maybe they don't want my mouth to speak this
Maybe they just wanna quiet momma
But the minute I step to the rhythm of the left
That's the minute that they don't wanna leave me alone
Doncha' think?
Power to the world, Lover's gold, and bees and nature?
not to break my heart..
They all shrunk off inside of me, they're all wrapped
up inside of me...
I feel certain ?, of those who fall upon got the ring of shadow of
my heart
? But these are the watcher's point of view...
