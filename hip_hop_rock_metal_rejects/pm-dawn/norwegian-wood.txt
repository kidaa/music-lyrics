I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me,
She showed me her room. Isn't it good. Norwegian Wood
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and noticed there was not a chair
So I sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two. And then she said...It's time for bed
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled up to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I, I lit a fire, isn't it good, Norwegian Wood
Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood,
Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood
