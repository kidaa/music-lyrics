Take me to your soul
Lose me in your smile
Baby I don't care just as long as I get there
No need for cliches
Or silly masquerades
I'm drifting endlessly, drifting closer to you
For so long I live in darkness
I'm looking for the light
You surround my heart with you love
Your aura shining bright
You keep the sun alive eternally
And you keep me from the night
Don't you know I'll do
What you want me to
Open up your soul and let me get close to you
I just wanna say
You take my breath away
I'll do what you want me to, I'll get lost in you
You're the only road
To my happiness
Hold me tightly in your arms caress me in your dreams
My love will find a way
To your emptiness
Singing tenderly to your emotions
So close but yet so far my imagination's
Running away with me
And it takes me to a place where
You're the only one I see
But when I awake all I have
Is pain and misery
[repeat chorus]
