I look at you, I feel invincible 
See all I need form you, is the passion in your eyes baby
I look at the fountain and I watch it overflow
You blow out the candles babe
And right before my eyes I see you change, you changed
And it comes in like the tide
A question mark lies on my face, I almost want to cry
You erase my emotions, with a kiss and clever sigh
I'm looking through you and you know how I feel
You say love's uncertain and it blows in like the wind
I say love's eternal and it comes from way within
You say love is passion, and confuse me once again
You got me goin' in circles babe
You left that figure 8 in my eyes
In my eyes
I wonder if I can set my emotions free for you
All I wanna do, is stare into your eyes baby
The times you said you loved me I can count em'
On my hands
I become confrontational
And all you have to do for me is cry is cry
I'm right there to hold your hand
To me you're just that personal, but you don't understand
Spoke to your compassion, I said I wonder where you are
I love you and you love me, I thought you'd understand
[repeat chorus]
