";A lot of strange words,
being said.

But you should know what they mean.
Because no-one should take part in anything if they

Marge Suti- ";Prince, Who is Prince?
A mellow guild by exterior
Kinda lovable...
But underneath lurkes,
things that might be unexpected
And right here we've definetly got a very interesting,

Maybe a time traveller,
Maybe from another dimention,
Not an earth bound creature,
Learning how to BE here,
But his mind is elsewhere...";
