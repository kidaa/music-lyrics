I know some just can't understand
It's not about the downfall of man
Let's drift safely on a journey to forget the past
Where happy people cry with me
And those full of life will die with me
Our final destination is peace at last
And I wonder how it would be
If my heart were free from humanity
Lord, I always dreamed it would be
Bliss eternally
If my heart were free from humanity
Constant wishing for some space
So I can dream of a place
Where there's a happy ever after for me and you
And I still hope that day will come, where we'll be the
Brilliant ones
And realize true beauty comes internally
[repeat chorus]
Where happy people cry with me
And those full of life will die with me
Our final destination is peace at last.
