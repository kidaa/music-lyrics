It's all good baby
Don't worry about it
Cause I've got all the love you'll ever need
Hey it's all good baby
Don't stress on it
Cause I've got all the love you'll ever need
*Surely...I've had so much pain from you
You make me regret my lifelines
360 degrees of ";love kills hatred";
to be your hate in the making
fascinates my ";why try's";
Dangerously...I couldn't care less for you
I got enough hatred to last me lifetimes
Insufficient dreams of love just make me wait for you to hate me
Disintegrate my blue skies
It's all good baby
Don't worry about it
Cause I've got all the love you'll ever need
Hey it's all good baby
Don't stress on it

Hey it's all good baby
Don't stress on it
Cause I've got all the love you'll ever need
Pseudo empathy framed in gold for you
My confusion comes in life size
Transmitting live from inner space
Just give me love and I will make it
It irritates my new eyes but...
It's all good baby
Don't worry about it
Cause I've got all the love you'll ever need
Hey it's all good baby
Don't stress on it
