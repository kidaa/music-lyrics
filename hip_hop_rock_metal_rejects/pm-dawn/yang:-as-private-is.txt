They always find you all the time...
I befriended my confusion quite some time ago
She tells me everything is gonna be alright it's alright
my senses make it real to me in all types of ways
but I'm so angry at my jealousy
that I hold it inside my heart like it's alright
Catapult my visions into realism's bosoms
Dreams prefer caesarian with plastic spoons and knives
that's what you get when your brain masturbates
there's no pleasure
so when I evacuate my intimate states
while screaming ";Oh how sweet it is to be loved by you";
the dirty rats you shoot me in the ass
so I don't know what happens when I free my mind
Oh, the cuts that you create let me be the martyr
If I started to love you now, there'd be no end to you
Oh, pick up my embrace. It lives without a reason.
Cause if I killed you now there'd be no end to you.
Cure my house of cards she sends me tears from outerspace
I'm wondering can I not enjoy the pains I find it's alright
Mirrors give me confidence in needing myself
but I'm so terrified of being me I get so right
I'm tryin' real hard not to be exactly the way I am
the next time I come here all I'm bringing to this atmosphere
is the will not to do it again
understand, I got neon King Kong standin' on my back
can't stop to turn around broke my sacroiliac
tryin' to keep sealed where this brother's really at
to tell the new millenium ";yo, what da dilly black";
You look cute in your stars and stripes she said are you coming out
tonight
That's why whom ever loves me will have to be my killer
Cause here I'm just a slave tryin to be the nigga
Oh, the cuts that you create let me be the martyr
If I started to love you now, there'd be no end to you
Oh, pick up my embrace. It lives without a reason.
Cause if I killed you now there'd be no end to you.
