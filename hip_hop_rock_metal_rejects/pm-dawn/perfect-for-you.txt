It's Love, not another word baby 
that can show what's yours in my heart. 
I'm not just enchanted, I see forever in my dreams. 
I'll just just have to wait for you, to see what your plan is, baby. 
Sometimes I hate this place, 
This is why noone wants to be in love anymore 
It's takin what's real from fake baby 
You could overlook the diamond, 
that's trying to be perfect for you. 
 chorus  
I know what's perfect for you 
Where you'll be perfectly safe inside my arms 
Let's make a promise right now 
If you can be perfect for me 
I'll be perfect for you. 
It's love, that's makin me regret 
every moment you're not around. 
I know you wanna believe me, 
but you've always been afraid. 
I wish there was a way that you could 
see inside my mind, baby. 
Sometimes I hate this place. 
This is why noone wants to be in love anymore 
It's takin what's real for fake baby. 
You could pass right by the diamond 
that's trying to be perfect for you.

Perfect for you...
