In midnight skies burn on many stories untold
On icy nights winds blow that touch everyone
You still think you are so far away
But you pay the dearest price of us all
'Cause you stand on the edge of the world
And you're dreaming all your precious time away
Dreaming all your precious time away
Morning comes so soon too bright in your eyes
Talking to yourself you don't even try
There alone where no-one bothers you
You can stay a thousand miles from us all
And in this world you sleep ignoring
Another night has passed
This endless sleep might be rewarding
Don't let it be your last
