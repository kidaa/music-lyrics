I bring you peace and understanding
I give you freedom from your cares
I bring the truth with no illusion
To give you hope when you despair
I have the secret of the whirlwind
I keep the eagle close at hand
This kingdom tall as any mountain
Will reap the treasure from the land
I am the teacher
I am the teacher
I am the teacher
More than you'll ever know
Everything I can show
I have the answers to all questions
Above us here and far below
No voices will be raised in anger
No cruel ambitions will you show
