Soldier of the line how does it feel
You're far away from home polishing steel
The sun moves in between the mountain and sky
As dawn puts out its fingers splitting them wide
Soldier of the line what do you know
About the other side, they never show
They must be well disguised biding their time
Their armour well prepared so nothing will shine
Soldier of the line would you kill me
There's something in your eyes stopping you see
They're cloudy and you turn your head away
What's that rolling down your face, are you OK?
Hold back those tears from your eye
Don't show those feelings inside
You're in a murderous playground
War games on a castle wall
You're in a murderous playground
Crossed out if you dare to fall
Soldier of the line it isn't fair
You're bleeding deep inside nobody cares
Your flag and lance stand proud splintered and red
No movement in the field, the crows will be fed
Soldier of the line you've come to the end
You'll never get to see your mother again
Some unfamiliar place you're going to stay
An unremembered name an unforgettable day
