The lights burned out, and with it it's taken my eyes
It seems so hard it's taken me by surprise
And oh baby all that you said must be lies
I cease to feel the wind and the rain on my face
Sometimes I'm sure but then I'm confused in my haste
And oh baby I'm standing but taking no space
But I don't cry easy no I don't cry at all
Oh but you don't believe me and I think that's my only downfall
What am I going to do about you baby
What am I going to do without you now
You had my love wild as an ocean could call
I was the fool and you were the winner take all
And oh baby it's so much to me yet so small
