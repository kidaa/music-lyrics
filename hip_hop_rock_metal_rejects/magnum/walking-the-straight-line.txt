Love don't come easy so don't treat it light
Remember there's two sides you'll make it alright
No magic potion no way to tell
Could be like heaven might be like hell
You're tempted to look around comes to us all
In moments of pleasure you're bound to recall
One bad decision that's all it will take
From something you treasure to something you break
Walking the straight line I hope it's the same with you
Walking the straight line that's all you gotta do
