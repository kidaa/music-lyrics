I still dream of paradise
I still wake up crying
I`ve seen the sun,of tomorrow rise
I felt like I was dying
I still dream of forever
I still see me wave
From the deepest pits of never
Another soul to save
I still long for the sun to rise
I still fear the dark
I`ve seen the signs of our last goodbyes
Another submerging ark
In bitterness I`ve tasted my tears
A burnt out soul of emptiness
I loneliness I`ve touched my fears
& closed my eyes for hopelessness
Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of my time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow fire
The forever winds won`t let me be
Wake me up from my forever empire
I am my paradise
Through my damnation you`ll fall
I am the wise
In my eternity I am all
You ask of me my sanity
Divided you shall fall
Your soul shall burn most certainly
Below me you will crawl
I am my own eternity
My creations will not fall
Dream or not it`s real to me
Your becoming I prevail
From my fists burns my fire
The emperor of my empire
Butt where will be a better day
Even I am doomed to fade away
Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of my time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow fire
The forever winds has left me
I am fading through the stars,my desire
