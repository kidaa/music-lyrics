Lyrics by Frode Glesnes
Music by Gerhard Storesund
In a silvershield of frost
Her realm proudly shimmers
Icy wastes and massive mist
Embraced by winds of death
Over the frosty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
The seeds were sawn at the dawn of time
More fierce than the dragons fire
Daugther of deaths descendant
In hollow halls beneath the world
Forever kept unlit
Suffer a ceaseless cold
Pain and hunger in her dreary home
Since ages gone for times to come
HORROR - Come horror and soon the awakening
ETERNAL - Come eternity become forever
DARKNESS - Come darkness craving apocalypse
SERENITY - Forget serenity chaos supreme
Eternal darkness, forever night
Shimmering flicker of candle light
Deep down dreary the Hel halls holds
The sepulchral essence of death
Anger and hate are ever awake
"Creator of death created me
Wolf and serpent preeminently"
Hel stands ready to fall upon them,
And seize them as her own
Falling deeper into the abyss
In which she dragged them down
As sure as water lost falls back as rain
The queen of Hel will rise again
And with her the eternally damned
HORROR - Come Horror and soon the awakening
ETERNAL - Come eternity become forever
DARKNESS - Come Darkness craving apocalypse
SERENITY -FORGET SERENITY CHAOS SUPREME
