Awaken thou one eyed God
Rise again from the slumber!
Give us a touch of the elder strenght
Flowing in your veins
And give us again the courage to crush
The embers of the faded ones
A lightning ripped the sky
The signs of ancient beliefs enlighten
The inner chambers
Of forbidden knowledge
Oh,rise the storm of elder
Let again Gungnir fly
Into the chests of Giants,
And release again thte power
Of your eight-leggend horse
Ride again in front of the Oskorei
And lead fear into hearts of men
Enlighten the path for those of the elder spirit
And quide them into glory
We entered a long gone and forgotten valley
It`s habitants flames of lie long gone
Ceased by a dark and ancient plague
In the heart of this forbitten place
We awakened the spirit of the past
And we entered the dawn
Of the slumbering one
Odin opened his eye
And looked out into the world
He lifted his arms to the sky
And called for he other gods
And commanded them to awaken
From their ages of slumber
Again their rose from the ground
For there where still embers
Of the lost faith of them
In the halls of Valhalla
