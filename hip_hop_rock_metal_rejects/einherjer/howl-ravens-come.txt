Lyrics by Gerhard Storesund
Tell me, Nikar, thou must know
The fate of Gods and men
When to wield the spear and bow
What omens do you send
In my words take heed
On woeful foes to dwell
Fields of scattered ravens feed
The forceful Gram knows well
Bloodeagle carved
With a bone-biting sword
Song of the wielded
Howl the ravens chord
Many an omen men only knew
Good when swords are swung
Unfailing followers battle through
Dark ravens come along
Heavy weight the second weighs
Arrayed with rage of war
Good if you see two men in race
for victors ancient lore
Bloodeagle carved
With a bone-biting sword
Song of the wielded
Howl the ravens chord
Howl ravens come
A third thing: Good hearing , the howl of a wolf
Carried from an ashes boughs
Good if you first sight thine enemies
Triumph over broken brows
No man in battle, his face shall turn
Against the sister of the moon
Scattered on the battlefield the bleeding burn
Awoken as a victor soon
