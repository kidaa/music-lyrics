On the other side we`ll stand
We`re the strong
In another world we`ll meet
You`ll be suffering one
On the other side we`ll fight
With swords of steel
In another world we`ll win
You`ll worship us and kneel
You`ll be the suffering one
On the other side we`ll fight
With swords of steel
Then a storm shall arise
Turning the skies black
Send up a howling wind
Across the churning sea
That`s just the beginning of
What awaits us all
The next three years shall be
Without summer or joy to man
The sign shall be - The blazing sky
The sign shall be - The grimmest cold
The sign shall be - The freezing winds of frost
The sign shall be - The Fimbul Winter
On the other side you`ll meet
Blades of steel
In another world you`ll meet
Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you`ll fight
The gods alliged
In another world you`ll fall
Our wrath will find you all
 Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you`ll fight
The gods alliged
With fire and frost
We`ll tear your limbs apart
With hammers and swords
We`ll crush your warrior
With wisdom and strength
We`ll conquer your troops
With hunger and pain
You will remember us
Bright shall shine the sun divine
And unsowed field shall grow
Trees shall grow and rivers flow
Through woods as green as man
Has ever seen
Brighter every day she`ll shine
The Mother of our lives
Though I don`t want to live to see
The day Ragnarok take our lives away
