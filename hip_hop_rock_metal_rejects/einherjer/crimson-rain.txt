Lyrics by Frode Glesnes
Music by Gerhard Storesund
I've had my courage measured
By the great heroic death
Behind a grisly image
A grim and ghastly wrath
A striking portrait hidden
In a cruel and ancient vision
Dark my pride of bravery
Through the eye of Odin I see....
An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world
Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Beware the Crimson rain
Precious arts of warfare
Gaining mortal sacrifice
The taste of blood the foaming frenzy
All berserkers rage
Emerging from a bloodred sky
As storming birds of prey
Shrieking Screaming Raging's menace
Catch the blood and await the fallen
My spear spreads fear my sword still kill
A grinding death my will
To be seen to be felt
Who dies first who follows after
My infinite powers like the
Strength of a storming sea
So it is for now and
So shall it forever be
An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world
Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Beware the Crimson rain
Sacrifice my life for Odins court
Grant immortality
Rise again to life the heroic dead
Await the horns sound
In days of yore, in truths of tales then told:
Odin :
You and every one of you
Who follow me are born into my clan
I mark as my own.
An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world
Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Become the Crimson rain
