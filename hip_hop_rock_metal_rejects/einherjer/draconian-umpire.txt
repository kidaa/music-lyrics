Lyrics by Gerhard Storesund
Music by Gerhard Storesund
I am called a noble beast
And dim is my name
My keen sword forge a noble feast
Now rests sublime untame
Never as a youth with a weaklings heart
Bravery in age unveil
The conquered thrall of Valfathers art
Freedoms bliss, death prevail
Listen your last
To the sound of my sword
Yours, beheaded
Gram, the dreaded
Grim carnivour
Listen your last
Til your heart sound no more
Fade you hear it
Ridil tear it
Out as you roar
In water drown if in wind thou fare
Doomed men bear misery
Leave my abundance! Away from here!
My penury your bane will be
The countenance of terror left me here
I now await the hoar of Hel to call
No man saved by a helm of fear
No man is mightier than all
Garms howl I hear as I die
Greed has overcome
Curse thee by the ring, I sigh
Your end shall become
