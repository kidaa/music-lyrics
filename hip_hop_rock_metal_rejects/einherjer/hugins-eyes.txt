Lyrics by Ragnar Vikse
Music by Gerhard Storesund
I have seen through raven's eyes
Blood spilt on dwarves-made steel
Young men, old men, ready to die
Brave men's path to higher grounds
I have often heard words of great wisdom
Battlecries ring the fields
I have been through water, air and fire
Seen the hall of Hel, deep underground
I shall not flee, though fated to die
For never have I known - Fear
I've seen foes blind and scared by death
Dead corpses with ropes round their neck
Berzerkers fighting with bare hands
Battle is better than to burn in the bed
I have heard the wolf-of-vows
Chain's break at end of times
Chaos roar through-out mankind
Brutal battle- please the raven
I shall not flee, though fated to die
For never have I known - Fear
Let my body's pyre fill the skies
Take my mark and let it lead you to my hall
Taste the blood in your mouth as you close the eyes
"I shall burn forever" echos in your mind
