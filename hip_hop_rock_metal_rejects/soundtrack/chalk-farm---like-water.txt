the lyrics

Mother Mother, Sister Sister
There's a candle and there's a flame
Let it burn until you feel the same again
Open up what you had locked away
'Cause I want you to feel what it is we've made

I fill you like water
I warm you when the Sun won't shine
I can see no other - Anytime

Mother Mother, Sister Sister
Look around and see what's on your mind
Never disagree with what you want to find
I'll be there to help your heart decide
'Cause I know holding you leaves the world behind

I fill you like water
I warm you when the Sun won't shine
I can see no other - Anytime
I fill you like water
I warm you when the Sun won't shine
I can see no other - Anytime 
Anytime

There is a life you're dreaming
Why don't you leave it up to me
Whisper the message to me 
I will be there for you all the way

I fill you like water
I warm you when the Sun won't shine
I can see no other - Anytime
I fill you like water
I warm you when the Sun won't shine
I can see no other - Anytime 
Anytime
