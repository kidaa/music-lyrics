the lyrics

So many times I try to make you understand
You never tried to see behind my smile

If I didn't know you like I do
I'd get you into the secret in me
Just because I'm good at fooling you
When no one's around I walk in your shoes

I'm smiling, while lying to you
I'm smiling, while lying to you
If you only knew

I always try to hide behind a painted smile
So many tears the public never see

If I didn't know you like I do
I'll get you into the secret in me
Just because I'm good at fooling you
When no one's around I walk in your shoes

I'm smiling, while lying to you
I'm smiling, while lying to you
When it always seems true

I'm smiling, while lying to you
I'm smiling, while lying to you
If you only knew

I'm smiling, while lying to you
I'm smiling, while lying to you
If you only knew

I'm smiling, while lying to you
I'm smiling, while lying to you
If you only knew
