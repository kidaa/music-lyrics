Written by James O'Gwynn 

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru my darkest gloom
Help me bring her mem'ry to this lonely room

Chorus
Talk to me and let me cry the whole night thru
You have lost, yes, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Talk about the love I miss
Talk to me about the lips I used to kiss
Tell me how she used to smile
Just before she said goodbye
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart, while I cry

Repeat chorus
