I must have been through about a million girls 
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone 
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir 
Their tears left me cold as a stone 
But then I fooled around and fell in love 
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did 
I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love 
It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked 
I'd get out my book and write down her name 
But when the grass got a little greener over on the other side 
I'd just tear out that page 
I fooled around and fell in love 
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby 
I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love 
Free, on my own is the way I used to be 
Ah, but since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me 
It's got a hold on me now, I can't let go of you baby 
I fooled around and fell in love 
I fooled around and fell in love, oh yes I did 
I fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, 
fooled around, fooled around, fell in love 
Fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, 
fooled around, fooled around, fell in love 
I fooled around, fell in love 
I fell in love, I fell in love, yes I did
