the lyrics

When I look in your eyes
All my dreams came true
I thought so deep a love
Nothing I could do
Now there's a distance
I feel so removed
You say you love me
Now prove that you do

Baby, action speaks louder than words
Take me in your arms
Kiss me like the first time
Action speaks louder than words
Just want you to love me
Don't want you to snub me
Show me that I'm wrong
Baby, action speaks louder than words

I need you so you don't know
What this does to me
I feel alone when you're there
That's no way to be
I miss your touch so desperately
You say you want me
Now make me believe

Baby, action speaks louder than words
Take me in your arms
Kiss me like the first time
Action speaks louder than words
Just want you to love me
Don't want you to snub me
Show me that I'm wrong
Baby, action speaks louder than words

I need you have to show me how you feel

Baby, action speaks louder than words
Take me in your arms
Kiss me like the first time
Action speaks louder than words
Just want you to love me
Don't want you to snub me
Show me that I'm wrong
Baby, action speaks louder than words
