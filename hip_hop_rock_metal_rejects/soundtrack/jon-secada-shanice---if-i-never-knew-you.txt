Music: Alan Menken, Lyrics: Stephen Schwartz
from  Pocahontas  soundtrack

If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be

And if I never held you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me

In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes

And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you

If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true

I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you

I thought our love would be so beautiful

Somehow we made the whole world bright

I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us where these whispers in the night
But still my heart is singing
We were right

If I never knew you
If I never knew this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be

There's no moment I regret
Since the moment that we met
If our time has gone too fast
I've lived at last...

I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright

I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light

And still my heart is singing
We were right

We were right
And If I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through

Empty as the sky

Never knowing why
Lost forever
If I never knew you
