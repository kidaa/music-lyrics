Freddy my love, I miss you more than words can say 
uh uh uh ahhh 
Freddy my love, please keep in touch while you're away 
oh-oh yeah 
Hearing from you can make the day so much better 
Getting a souvenir or maybe a letter 
I really flipped over the great cashmere sweater 
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove 

Freddy you know, your absence makes me feel so blue 
so-oh blue 
That's okay though, your presents make me think of you 
sure they do 
My ma will have a heart-attack when she catches 
Those pedal-pushers with the black leather patches 
Oh how I wish I had a jacket that matches, Freddy my love 
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove 

Don't keep your letters from me, I thrill to every line 
Your spelling's kinda crummy, but honey so is mine 
I treasure every gifty, the ring is really nifty 
You say it cost you fifty, so you're thrifty, I don't mind 

Whoa - Freddy you see, you'll hold me in your arms someday Freddy my lo-ove 
And I will be wearing your lacy lingerie 
Freddy I'm yours 
Thinking about it, my heart's pounding already 
Knowing when you come home, we're bound to go steady 
And throw your service pay around like confetti, Freddy my love 

Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove - ooh Freddy 
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove - ooh Freddy 
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove - I'm ready 
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove - ooh Freddy 
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my lo-ove...
