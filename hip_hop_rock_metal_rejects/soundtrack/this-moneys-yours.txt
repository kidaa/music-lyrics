KIM wakens. CHRIS hands her the money he had left.

CHRIS
this money's yours
please take it all
hey, you want more?

KIM
no, no, I don't want anything

CHRIS
hey, what's wrong with you?

KIM
I've not done this before

CHRIS
that can't be true!

KIM
why would I lie?

CHRIS
all the girls lie!
they just want to get out of here
maybe you're not like that
but I don't know who you are

KIM
do you want one more tale of a Vietnam girl?
want to know I was bound to a man I don't love?
do you want to be told how my village was burned?
want to hear how my family was blasted away?
how I ran from the rice field and saw them in flames?
how my parents were bodies whose faces were gone?

I have had my fill of pain
I will not look back again
I would rather die


CHRIS
can I see you tonight?

KIM
well, I'll be at the club 
selling "beaucoup amour"

CHRIS
no, you won't

how would you like...

KIM
how would I like...?

CHRIS
how would you like
living with me?
it feels good like this
so that's how we should be

so would you like?

KIM
yes, I would like!

CHRIS
okay, it's set
no more to say
screw the Engineer
you're the one good thing
that I've found out here
