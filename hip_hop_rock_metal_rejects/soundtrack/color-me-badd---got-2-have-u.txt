Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-........Lovely...
Oh you make my world go round
Pick me up when I'm down
This much you mean to me  ah - ah - ah
The way you understand
The way you hold my hand
In times of loving me lovely...

Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Ooh, I got that feeling inside
When I get you on my mind ya -ya - ooh - ya!
Sweet lovely, lovely, lovely
Ya that deep down feeling inside
I'm begging you to be mine

Chorus
Say, gotta have you for myself
I want you in my life
I'm tryin to tell you 
That I really gotta have ya'
Cuz' girl you are so sweet,
Your sweet enough to eat
I wanna' let you know 
I really gotta have you.

As gentle as a rose
My love for you knows
You must be sent from above - ooh ya!
And when I am on my knees
To God I'm begging you please
Let me jump in your love...Ooh...

Lovely, lovely, lovely.....
Ooh, That deep down feeling ya
It's like a summer dream I'm dreaming
Sweet lovely, lovely, lovely....
Ya' that deep down feeling inside
Now wont you set me free

Chorus
....Said we got your motion, earl of potion
.................................................... Dog in motion
Met her from around the way
Yo' me never find a girl - So what?
The island chillin' - coolin' and willin'
To get with that girlie 
She was one in a million
Met her from around the way
Yo' me never find a girl so fly and lovely

Sweet lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely...
Baby you know 
I really got to have you!
