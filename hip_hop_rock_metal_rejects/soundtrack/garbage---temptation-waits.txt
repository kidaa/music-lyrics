I'll tell you something
I am a wolf but 
I like to wear sheep's clothing
I am a bonfire
I am a vampire
I'm waiting for my moment


Chorus:
You come on like a drug
I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you 
For a little more
And there's so much at stake
I can't afford to waste 
I never needed anybody like this before


I'll tell you something
I am a demon
Some say my biggest weakness
I have my reasons
Call it my defense
Be careful what you're wishing


Chorus 

You are a secret
A new possession
I like to keep you guessing


Chorus 

When I'm not sure what I'm living for
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for verse x3
