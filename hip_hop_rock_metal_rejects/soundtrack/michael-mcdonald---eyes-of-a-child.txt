the lyrics

The eyes of a child
So innocent and pure
A child's heart is full of song
Take that tiny hand and lead them to the light
As adults, we see pain in the world
And it sometimes don't seem right

But through the eyes of a child
The world seems magical
There's a sparkle in their eyes
They've yet to realize the darkness in the soul

The beauty of a smile
Adventurous and wild
Life is kind of gay 
But it doesn't seem that way through the eyes of a child

So don't give up
Even when the road seems long
Just find that child inside of you
Yeah you gotta find you
Spread your wings and fly
To the brightest star
If you want I can even get my friend Steve to detail your car
For like, twenty bucks

But through the eyes of a child
They world seems magical
There's a sparkle in their eyes
They've yet to realize the darkness in the soul


The beauty of their smile
Adventurous and wild
Sure, life is kinda gay
But it doesn't seem that way
Through the eyes of a child

I've gotta eye on my hand
I've gotta eye on my hand
I've gotta eye on my hand
But still I can't find you
Eye on my hand
Where have you gone, girl?
m coming up behind you
Eye on my hand
Don't turn around, now
Cuz I'm right there
I'm coming up behind you

pause

Through the eyes of a child
The world seems magical
The sparkle in their eyes
They've yet to realize 
They bastards they really are

The beauty of their smile
Adventurous and wild
Sure, life is kinda gay
But it doesn't seem that way
Through the eyes of a child

Sure, life is kinda gay
But it doesn't seem that way
Through the eyes of a child
