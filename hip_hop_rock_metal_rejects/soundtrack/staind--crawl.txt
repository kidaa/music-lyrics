I'm so lonely
You're so beautiful
Not the only
One who's pitiful
Stretched and torn I lay here in Pieces
Craving all of your deadly vices
Like to think I'm not addicted
But I guess I wear it well

Chorus
And I crawl, while you spit
And I crawl, through your shit

Here I am now
Not a lot has changed
Nothing better
Everything's the same
Late at night I can hear your voices
Talking shit about my choices
You would think that you've known me forever
just because you know my name

Chorus
And I crawl, while you spit
And I crawl, through your shit

Bridge
Everything falls apart repeat

Chorus
And I crawl, while you spit
And I crawl, through your shit
