Guy feat. 1 Life 2 Live 

[Guy]:
Yeah uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah

Yes! G-U-Y and I
Gotta get a piece of this pie
Gonna take you on a high
Do or die
Are you with it?
Cause you can be the one who can get it
And if I get money we can split it
If I gave you my life would you live it
Would you fit it?

Now who wanna be the freeloader
Who wanna be the shareholder
Who's gonna be the downloaders
When I download the **** on the block
All consumers just be ready to cop
Cause I'm ready to drop, **** be fifty a pop
You better let me know if you want it or not
Yo it's gonna be gone by the end of the day
Cause **** from Y2K

1 -    We're talking 'bout the best
    Take it to the wild, wild West
    Talking about the dirty south
    That's what I'm all about, no doubt
    Take it to the East
    You gotta go fast in the streets
    Cause I'm living in the belly of the beast
    I'm just trying to live in peace, roll out

Now we're rolling on the South side
With my true playas this is from the East side
Got my shorties in the back
Got my niggaz in the front
And my fifteen inch rims on my hoo ride
Now who rides, rolling through the ATL so don't trip
Plus you're about to get yourself in some ****
And you know we got your back
All the clubs are pack from front to back, the girls are phat
Booty banging like a budha sack
And when you're living in the ghetto
You gotta know when to let go
How to hold every dice roll
Or your platinum from your white gold
Plus the price is on your soul
And everyday's in vain
Shooting you're luck like a monopoly game
And everybody's looking for the fortune and fame
That's the name of this thang

Repeat 1

[1 Life 2 Live]:
Only the best like pushing black Bentley coupes
You ain't the best so that just can't be you
Only the best like coppin' a platinum piece
You ain't the best nigga **** cheap
Me, toxic, I split vintage
Everything you talk you know we been did
You kick one rap and you all winded
Your career real quick started and ended
We the elite means we the top of the line
Means we go straight in while you stopping in the line
Means I don't give a **** what you got in your rhymes
Means y'all get to going when I'm cocking my nine
When Teddy told me the cost, **** hit me hard
Pay me how many thousands for sixteen bars?
You wiling, you gon' regret that you started this mess
Got two g but will never be part of the best

Repeat 1

Just trying to live in peace yeah, yeah
