Disturb not the harmony 
Of fire, ice, or lightning 
Lest these titans wreek distruction upon the world in which they clash 

Though the water's great gaurdian shall rise to quell the fighting 
Alone its song will fail 
Lest the Earth shall turn to ash 

You're the Chosen One 
The Chosen One 
You are the Chosen One 
Oh, The chosen one 
The Chosen One 

Into thine hands bring together all three 
The treasures combined to tame the Beast of the Sea 
From the trio of islands 
Ancient spheres shall you take 
For between life and death 
All the difference you'll make 

You're the Chosen One 
The Chosen One 
You are the Chosen One 
Oh, the Chosen One 
The Chosen One 

Climb to the shrine to right what is wrong 
And the world will be healed by the guardian song 

You're the Chosen One 
The Chosen One 
You are the Chosen One 
Oh, the Chosen One 
The Chosen One 
You are the Chosen One 
Oh, the Chosen One 
The Chosen One 
You are the Chosen One 
Oh, the Chosen One 
Chosen One 
You are the Chosen One 
Oh, the Chosen One
