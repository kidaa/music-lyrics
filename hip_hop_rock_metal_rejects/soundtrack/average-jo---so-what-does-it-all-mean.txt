The day I first met you, 
Well I thought it quite funny. 
Your eyes were so damn blue, 
Your smile was a drug, your style was money. 

So what does it all mean 
To find someone that makes you cry inside? 
She's got the players on her team, 
How could I smile when all she did was say Hi? 

-Chorus-
That one day when he is gone, 
I'll get my chance to ask you out. 
And then I'll show my colorful life. 

I'd like to be like you. 
With a rep like yours my little honey. 
I'm not sure what I can do. 
Just know that I ain't no fuckin' dummy. 

So what does it all mean? 
To try so hard to get the right words out. 
Well I wish I could come clean. 
I'll give it my all, but I have my doubts.
