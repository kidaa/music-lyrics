"Dreamland" is a club filled with American Marines, civilians and south 
Vietnamese officers. The girls parade around and get the crowd to buy 
raffle tickets: the winner of the "beauty contest" will be the prize.

AMERICANS
the heat is on in Saigon
the girls are hotter 'n' hell
one of these slits here will be Miss Saigon
God, the tension is high, not to mention the smell
the heat is on in Saigon
is there a war going on?
don't ask, I ain't gonna tell

two friends, CHRIS and JOHN, are among the Marines. JOHN is with 
one of the girls

ENGINEER
ah, monsieur Chris! monsieur John!
you've come to win Miss Saigon

JOHN
I gotta get my friend laid
as a last souvenir

CHRIS
I love you, pal, but your bullshit
I've had up to here

ENGINEER, CHRIS and JOHN
the heat is on in Saigon

JOHN
but 'til they tell us we're gone
I'm gonna buy you a girl

CHRIS
you can buy me a beer

the girls leave the men and move onto the stage

MIMI
see my bikini, it's just the right size

YVETTE
don't you enjoy how it rides up my thighs?
look from behind, it'll knock out your eyes

YVONNE
I'll show you: my special trophy of war

MIMI
for a Marine, I'll show more

AMERICANS
you won't get up off the floor

the heat is on in Saigon
don't tell me I'm reassigned, all that chickenshit sucks
tonight I'm out of my mind, not to mention ten bucks

GIGI
if I'm your pin-up, I'll melt all your brass
stuck on your wall, with a pin in my ass
if you get me, you will travel first class
I'll show you, we will make magic, cheri

ENGINEER
you buy more tickets from me
the winner gets her for free

CHRIS
the meat is cheap in Saigon
I used to love getting stoned, waking up with some whore
I don't know why I went dead, it's not fun anymore

the ENGINEER pushes KIM forward

KIM
I'm seventeen, and I'm new here today
the village I come from seems so far away
all of the girls know much more what to say
but I know
I have a heart like the sea
a million dreams are in me

CHRIS
Good Jesus, John, who is she?

AMERICANS AND CROWD
the Cong is tight'ning the noose
is it a week or a day or an hour that we got?
tonight could be our last shot got to put it to use

the GIRLS come off the stage and mingle with the men.

ALL, INCLUDING GIRLS
tonight I bet that you and I will get along
forget about the threat, forget the Viet-Cong

ALL MEN
Mimi, Gigi, Yvette or Yvonne
gonna buy me a beer, and elect Miss Saigon

the ENGINEER holds the election by holding his hand over each girl's 
head for applause. When KIM is judged, CHRIS claps loudly, which 
makes her notice him.

ENGINEER
Yvonne, Yvette, Mimi, Kim, Gigi

GIGI wins

ENGINEER
attention, s'il vous plait!
by popular demand
Miss Gigi Van Tranh
is elected Miss Saigon!

the ENGINEER puts a cheap tiara on GIGI and a ribbon which says 
"Miss Saigon".

AMERICANS
the heat is on in Saigon
and things are not going well
but still at midnight, the party goes on
a good-bye party in hell

ENGINEER
and now who wins this pussycat?

the ENGINEER holds a bowl; GIGI picks up a ticket.

GIGI
number 66!

it is one of the Marines. He cheers with his friends. The scene freezes.
