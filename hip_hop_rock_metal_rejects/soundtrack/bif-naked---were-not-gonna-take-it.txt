*We're not gonna take it 
No, we ain't gonna take it 
We're not gonna take it anymore 
We've got the right to choose it 
There ain't no way we'll lose it 
This is our life; this is our song 
We'll fight the powers that be just don't pick our destiny 
'cause you don't know us, you don't belong 
Repeat * 

Oh you're so condescending 
Your goal is never ending 
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you 
Your life is trite and jaded boring and confiscated 
If that's your best, your best won't do Release 
Oh...................... 
Oh...................... 
We're right/ yeah 
We're free/ yeah 
We'll fight/ yeah 
You'll see/ yeah 

Repeat *
