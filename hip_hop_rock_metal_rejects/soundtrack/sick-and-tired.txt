Verse 1:
There were times when we used to go out
Now all we do is scream and shout
Used to by me things and compliment
Now everything's an arguement
Tell me when it ever went wrong
Cause I don't wanna be another couple that you hear in a sad song
Whay can't we communicate
Before it's much too late

Chorus:
And I'm sick of playing games
I'm sick of waiting by
Other times we're cool
and other times we're not
I'm sick of crying all these nights
I'm sick of being sick and tired

And I'm sick of all these rules
I'm sick of all these lies
Half the time we're cool 
And other times we're not
Sick of waitng all my life
I'm sick of being sick and tired

Verse 2:
Remember when we used to have fun
I know you can't even remember the last time
I know your seeing someone
Cause you've been walking around like everything was just fine
What the hell have I done
For you to have me feeling like I'm loosing me mind
I don't wanna be with no one
But you always front on being nice

Chorus:
And I'm sick of playing games
I'm sick of waiting by
Other times we're cool
and other times we're not
I'm sick of crying all these nights
I'm sick of being sick and tired

And I'm sick of all these rules
I'm sick of all these lies
Half the time we're cool 
And other times we're not
Sick of waitng all my life
I'm sick of being sick and tired

Bridge:
I never did ask for nothing
But I can tell your going through something
Now why would you risk me leaving our home
I hope you put your thought into this
Cause when I'm gone I know that you'll miss
All my love
Cause baby when it's gone I'm gone gone gone gone gone I'm gone gone gone

Said I'm sick and tired
of all the lies
can't do it nomore
Said I can't do it nomore
So, so, so, so tired
Ladies, Ladies help me sing I'm

Chorus:
And I'm sick of playing games
I'm sick of waiting by
Other times we're cool
and other times we're not
I'm sick of crying all these nights
I'm sick of being sick and tired

And I'm sick of all these rules
I'm sick of all these lies
Half the time we're cool 
And other times we're not
Sick of waitng all my life
I'm sick of being sick and tired
