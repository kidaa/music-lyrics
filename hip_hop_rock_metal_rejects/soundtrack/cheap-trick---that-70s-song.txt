Hanging out! 
Down the Street - 
the same old thing! 
We did last week 
Not a thing to do - 
but to talk to you 
woaho yeah! 
Hello Wisconsin! 
Mom and Dad live upstairs
The music's loud
So we don't care
Nixon's gone 
But rock lives on 
Alright! 
We're still rocking in Wisconsin 
Oh yeah! 
We're still rocking in Wisconsin 
That's right! 
Steal a car 
And drive on down ... pick me up 
And we'll drive around 
Not a thing to do 
But talk to you 
Whoah yeah! Hello Wisconsin!
