GREGORY:
God has smiled upon you this day
The fate of a nation, in your hands
And blessed be the children
Who fight with all our bravery
Till only the righteous stand

You see the distant flames
They bellow in the night
You fight in all our names
For what we know is right
And when you all get shot
And cannot carry on
Though you die, La Resistance lives on!

GREGORY AND CHILDREN
You may get stabbed in the head
With a dagger or sword
You may be burned to death
Or skinned alive or worse
And when they torture you
You'll have nothing indeed to run for
Though you die, La Resistance lives on!

PARENTS
Blame Canada!
Blame Canada!


KYLE'S MOM
Because the country's gone awry
Tomorrow night these freaks will fry!


SOLDIERS
Tomorrow night our lives will change
Tomorrow night we'll be entertained
An execution! What a sight!
Tomorrow night!

SATAN
Up there there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom
Tomorrow night up there is doomed
And so I will be going soon!

TERRANCE AND PHILLIP
Shut your fucking face, Uncle Fucka
You're a boner biting bastard, Uncle Fucka

TERRANCE
Looks like we may be out of luck

PHILLIP
Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked!

STAN AND KYLE
Why did our mothers start this war?
What the fuck are they fighting for?
When did this song become a marathon?


SATAN
I want to be up there!


KYLE'S MOM
When Canada is dead and gone
They'll be no more Celine Dion!!


OVERLAP SOLDIERS 
Tomorrow night our lives will change
Tomorrow night we'll be entertained
An execution! What a sight!
Tomorrow night! 

GREGORY AND CHILDREN
They may cut your dick in half
And serve it to a pig
And though it hurts you'll laugh
And dance a dickless jig
But that's the way it goes
*In war you're shat upon
Though you die, La Resistance lives on!

SATAN
I want to be up there!

PARENTS
Blame Canada!
Blame Canada!
Blame Canada!
