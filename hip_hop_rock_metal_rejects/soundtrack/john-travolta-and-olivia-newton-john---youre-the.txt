I got chills their multiplyin 
And I'm losin control 
Cause the power your supplyin its electrifyin 
You better shape up cause I need a man and my 
heart is set on you 
you better shape you better understand to my 
heart I must be true 
Nothing left nothing left for me to do 
Your the one that I want 
You oo oo honey 
The one that I want 
You oo oo honey 
The one that I want 
You oo oo are what I need oh yes indeed 
Oh yes indeed 
If your filled with affection 
Your too shy to convey 
Meditate in my direction 
Feel your way 
I better shape up cause you need a man 
I need a man 
Who could keep me satisfied 
I better shape up if I'm gonna prove 
You better prove that my faith is justified 
Are you sure 
Yes I'm sure down deep inside 
Your the one that I want 
You oo oo honey 
The one that I want 
You oo oo honey 
The one that I want 
You oo oo are what I need oh yes indeed 
Oh yes indeed
