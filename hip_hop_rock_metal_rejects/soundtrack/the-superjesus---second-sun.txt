I caught the tale of something I forgot to give
its the strangest of emotions
I couldn't tell if its the enemy in me
and now well I could take a thousand years
where no-one stands and no-one hears
something tells me I could be alright
through all the changes I could crawl
its not enough to save it all
temporary happiness, I like it.

would you say I'm never gonna tell you
don't you know I'm straight to the point again
and I'm waiting for the second sun
to show me where I'm going wrong

could you see if anybody is looking my way
I don't know if I believe you
I hope to god its coming back on me someday
its always happening to someone who
could take it all and see it through
now I'm left with nothing that I would need
and everything will turn around
and just as I'm here I've found
standing in the wake of you, I like it.

would you say I'm never gonna tell you
don't you know I'm straight to the point again
and I'm waiting for the second sun
to show me where I'm going wrong

now you'll hide in the alley way
safe from the longest day
we'll take on all you say
temporary happiness
I never thought I'd be the friend I had in me

would you say I'm never gonna tell you
don't you know I'm straight to the point again
and I'm waiting for the second sun
to show me where I'm going wrong
