Ok, so you've got a car 
oh
ah yeah-yeah 
ah yeah-yeah 
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart 
But you've got being right down to an art 
You think you're a genius - you drive me up the wall 
But you're a regular original, a know-it all 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else 

Ok, so you're a rocket scientist 
That don't impress me much 
So you got the brain but have you got the touch 
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright 
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night 

That don't impress me much 
I've never knew a guy 
who carried a mirror in his pocket 
And a comb up his sleeve - just in case 
And all that extra hold get in your hair oughtta lock it 
'Cause heaven forbid it should fall out of place 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else 

Ok, so you're Brad Pitt 
That don't impress me much 
So you got the looks but have you got the touch 
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright 
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night 
That don't impress me much 
That don't impress me 
oh no no 
You think you're cool but have you got the touch 
na-na
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright 
But that won't keep me warm on a long, cold, lonely night 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special 
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else 

oh
That don't impress me much 
uh-ah
That don't impress me much 
Ok, so what do you think you're Elvis or something 
You must be jokin', right! 
Elvis
Elvis
uh-ah
uh-ah
You must be jokin', right! 
ah yeah-yeah 
You must be jokin', right! 
ah yeah-yeah 
I cant believe you did that 
I cant believe you did that 
I cant believe you did that 
Ok
Ok
Ok
