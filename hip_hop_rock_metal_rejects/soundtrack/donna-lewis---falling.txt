Maybe we've gone too far 
Another emotional tie on me 
And I don't know who you really are 
Putting my trust in you 
Safe in your presence I will be 
If I thought it was the thing to do 
With you 
It feels like I'm falling deeper 
Into the unknown 
I'm losing the fight to stay alone 
I'm falling, falling for you 
Where do we go from here 
Why do we stand in silence waiting for 
The other to make a move yes we do 
And how do I feel right now? 
Stepping out of my private world into 
Something that scares me so you know 
It feels like I'm falling ... ... ... ... 
Maybe I don't want to know 
Maybe I want to feel for you 
Maybe I don't want to know 
Maybe I want to feel for you 
Maybe I don't want to know 
Maybe I want to feel for you 
Falling deeper into the unknown 
I'm losing the fight to stay alone 
I'm falling, falling for you
