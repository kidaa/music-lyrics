I want to be with you everywhere 
I want to be with you everywhere 

Can you hear me calling 
Out your name 
You know that I'm falling 
And I don't know what to say 

I'll speak a little louder 
I'll even shout 
You know that I'm proud 
And I can't get the words out 

Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 
wanna be with you everywhere 
ooh-ooh babe 

Something's happening 
Happening to me 
My friends say 
I'm acting peculiarly 

C'mon baby 
We better make a start 
You better make it soon 
Before you break my heart 

Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
ooh-hoo
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 
C'mon baby 
C'mon baby 
C'mon baby 

Can you hear me calling 
Out your name 
You know that I'm falling 
And I don't know what to say 

Come along baby 
We better make a start 
You better make it soon 
Before you break my heart 

Oh I...
ooh-hoo
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
ooh-hoo
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 
Oh I...
I want to be with you everywhere 

C'mon baby 
C'mon baby 
C'mon baby 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon 
C'mon c'mon
