Everybody wants to be a master
Everybody wants to show their skills
Everybody wants to get there faster
Make their way to the top of the hill

Each time, you try
Gonna get just a little bit better
Each step, you climb
Is one more step up the ladder

Chorus: 
It's a whole new world we live in
It's a whole new way to see
It's a whole new place 
With a brand new attitude
But you still gotta catch'em all
And be the best that you can be

Pokmon Johto

Everybody wants to make a statement
Everybody needs to carve their mark
To stand alone in the victory circle
Stake their claim when the music starts
Give it all, you got 
You can be the very best ever
Take your best shot
What you will learn will come together 

Repeat Chorus
