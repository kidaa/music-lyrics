Chorus
[Nate Dogg] 
Every time Ifeel the music 
Man I loose it 
Every time 
Every time Ifell the music 
Man I loose it 
Every time 

[Shade Shiest] 
Yo, check it, check it out 
Yo, uh-huh 
Shiest the vet, fresh out your ghetto tape decks 
It's me and Nate back at it with another for your neck 
Another for a check means, Another for the set green 
Is what I need to get, Cali's where I wanna be 
And I ain't got to lie about the hood or the city 
Shade straight from the sue of Jerry up where it's shitty 
I got a mouth on me, farthest thing from being pretty 
As I cash a check compliments of Nate and Dogg Pound-dation 
Shade move the feet of every nation 
Kids got the beast now, Trey about to eat now 
We both got a plan to leave them haters in they sleep now 
Soakin' in the sweat from the heat from the speaks now 

Chorus

[Nate Dogg] 
There ain't, no way I'm missing my call 
Suddenly fall fucking with y'all 
Homie can't you; see me trying to get paid 
Everyday any kinda way 
There ain't, no way you taking my bang 
Let your ass think your pussy don't stank 
Hell no, you got it all wrong 
You need to move on, I'm singing my song 
Tell me, can you feel the beat 
Is it, moving your feet? 
Cause it, surely moves me 
Well then, ok let's be on our way 
Shade Shiest and big Nate 
Just let the beat bang
