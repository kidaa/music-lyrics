Yo fight turn this mic up... yeahh
QT...

Most people tell me I'm still too young
To take a ladies hand and give it the tounge
But what do they know about puberty?
About being 14, and living with needs
They just need to be living with the truth
It's all the young dudes who got the best booze yeah
Call my the heartthrob that wasn't choice
I'm just a nice guy with a pretty good voice
If you're a girl 
Come get with me and girl I'm gonna make you smile
If you get scared, I'll take you by the hand
I'll show you heaven, I will be your dream man

Gonna be your awesome lover
Gonna be your number one man
Wanna be your real heartbreaker
The best lover best lover in all the land
Wanna be your awesome lover 
Wanna be your awesome lover
Awesome lover..
The best lover best lover in all the land

Are you sick of guys who come on too strong?
Who just want to see you wearing a tight thong
I don't even know what a thong is,
But I got an A+ on the Teen Chomp Quiz!
So sit back, relax,
And I won't hit on you
Just let yourself drown in my baby blues...
Okay so I'm older than your average teen
But baby I will treat you just like a queen
I'm wise and mature and so generous too
And I'll never use cuss words like hump or screw
A smooth older man
Is just what you need
Cause lovin is better at a way slower speed...

Wanna be your awesome lover
Wanna be your number one man
Wanna be your real heartbreaker
The best lover best lover in all the land
Wanna be your awesome lover
Wanna be your awesome lover
Awesome lover..
The best lover best lover in all the land

Some ladies like guys who treat them like crap
Has lots of tattoos and is all into rap
Guess what, that's me, your own gangsta toy.
If you're the kind girl who loves a real bad boy...

Gonna Be Your
Wanna be Your awesome lover
Wanna be your number one man
Wanna be your real heartbreaker
The best lover best lover in all the land
