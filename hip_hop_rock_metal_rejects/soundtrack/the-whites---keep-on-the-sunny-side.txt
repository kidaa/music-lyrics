A.P. Carter and Gary Garett 

There's a dark   a troubled side of life 
There's a bright, there's a sunny side, too 
Tho' we meet with the darkness and strife 
The sunny side we also may view 


cho: Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side, 
     Keep on the sunny side of life 
     It will help us ev'ry day, it will brighten all the way 
     If we'll keep on the sunny side of life 


The storm and its fury broke today, 
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear; 
Clouds and storms will, in time, pass away 
The sun again will shine bright and clear. 
Let us greet with the song of hope each day 
Tho' the moment be cloudy or fair 
Let us trust in our Saviour away 
Who keepeth everyone in His care
