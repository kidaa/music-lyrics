All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
This stupid sweater 
This stupid... 

Every year Christmas comes and it goes 
Shedding tears where no one even knows 
It so hard to be good when you are poor 
I don't need a lot, just a little more 

All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
This stupid sweater 
This stupid... 

Look around, everybody's got the goods 
And I've been cheated and misunderstood 
Santa's gone and messed up once again 
I've been good, but I've still got nothing 

All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
This stupid sweater 
This stupid sweater 
This stupid... 

I don't want your socks or shirts or ties 
All I need is four wheels so I can ride 
You can stick that sweater up your ass 
Every time seems to be worse than the last 

All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
All I wanted was a skateboard, but all I got was... 
This stupid sweater 
This stupid... 
This stupid sweater 
This stupid... 

Yeah!
