Good Bye, Hard Life 
Don't Cry Would you let it ride? 
repeat 

You can't see the mornin', but I can see the light 
Ride ride ride let it ride 
While you've been out runnin' I've been waitin' half the night 
Ride ride ride let it ride 

Chorus 
And would you cry if I told you that I lied and would you say goodbye Or 
would you let it ride? And would you cry if I told you that I lied and 
would you say goodbye Or would you let it ride? 

Babe my life is not complete I never see you smile 
Ride ride ride let it ride 
Baby you want the forgivin' kind and that's just not my style 
Ride ride ride let it ride 

Chorus 

I've been doin' things worthwhile, you've been bookin' time 
Ride ride ride let it ride 

Chorus 

Would you let it ride x4 
Drum 
Ride ride ride let it ride x5 
Would you let it ride? x4 
Instrumental fade.
