Thanks to  Julie James for submitting the lyrics 

We've taken all you've given 
But it's gettin' hard to make a livin' 
Mr. President have pity on the working man 

We're not asking you to love us 
You may place yourself high above us 
Mr. President have pity on the working man 

I know it may sound funny 
But people ev'ry where are runnin' out of money 
We just can't make it by ourself 

It is cold and the wind is blowing 
We need something to keep us gong 
Mr. President have pity on the working man 

Maybe you've cheated 
Maybe you've lied 
Maybe you have lost your mind 
Maybe you're only thinking 'bout yourself 

Too late to run. Too late to cry now 
The time has come for us to say good-bye now 
Mr. President have pity on the working man 
Mr. President have pity on the working man
