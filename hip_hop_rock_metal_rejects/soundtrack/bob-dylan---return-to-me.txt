C. Lombardo, D. DiMinno

Return to me,
Oh, my dear I'm so lonely
Hurry back, hurry back, oh my love,
Hurry back, I am yours.

Return to me,
For my heart wants you only.
Hurry home, hurry home, won't you please,
Hurry home, to my heart.

My darling,
If I hurt you, I'm sorry,
Forgive me
And please say you are mine.

Return to me,
Please come back bella mia,
Hurry back, hurry back, hurry home,
To my arms and my heart.

Ritorna me,
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu
Mio cuore...
