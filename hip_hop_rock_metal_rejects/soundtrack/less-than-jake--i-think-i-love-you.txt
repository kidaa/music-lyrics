I'm sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
When all at once I woke up
From something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane
I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I said
I THINK I LOVE YOU!
This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And not go and shout it
When you walked into the room
I THINK I LOVE YOU!
I THINK I LOVE YOU!
So what am I so afraid of?
Afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there's no cure for
Yeah I think I love you
But that is what life is made of
So it worries me to say
I've never felt this way
Believe me, you really don't need to worry
I only want to make you happy
So if you say  Hey go away , I will
But I think better still
I better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case?
LET ME ASK YOU TO YOUR FACE!
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
A love there's no cure for
So it worries me to say
I've never felt this way
I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I've got so much to think about
Yeah yeah
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
Afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there's no cure for
Do you think you love me?
I think I love you
I think I love you
I THINK I LOVE YOU!
