Countless eyes are watching 
In this our finest hour 
It's time to realize the dream 
Of who we really are 
I'm gonna freeze this space in time 
Rise to make the call 
Cease the moment 
Make it mine 
And through it all 

Straight as the arrow flies 
I will run towards the finish line 
With all the strength I've found 
My feet won't touch the ground 
I will scale the heights if I believe 
The wings of faith will carry me 
I'll go the distance just to reach 
The arms I'm running to 
I'll go the extra mile for you 

I know it won't be easy 
To make you understand 
I want to take the glory 
And put it in your hands 
'Cause your the light that makes me shine 
You're the hero in my eyes 
Win or lose 
Do or die 
? 

Straight as the arrow flies 
I will run towards the finish line 
With all the strength I've found 
My feet won't touch the ground 
I will scale the heights if I believe
The wings of faith will carry me 

I'll go the distance just to reach 
The arms I'm running to 
I'll go the extra mile for you 
Go the extra mile 
In the end 
Go the extra mile 
I want to be able to say 

Tell the world to see 


I would do it all again 
I'd go the extra mile 

Straight as the arrow flies 
I will run towards the finish line 
With all the strength I've found 
All the strength I've found 
My feet won't touch the ground 
I will scale the heights if I believe 
The wings of faith will carry me 
I'll go the distance just to reach 
The arms I'm running to 

I'll go the extra mile 
For you 

Knowing it will be worth while 
I will go the extra mile 
For you
