Anna and Louis are packing the last of their belongings,
Lady Thiang appears with the news that he King is dying. 
Anna finds the King in his study surrounded by wives and 
children, and watches as he passes on the crown to his 
eldest son. In his first hesitating moment as King.
Chulalongkorn reveals the influence of Anna's teaching, and
Anna, trembling with emotion, realizes the magnitude of her
Accomplishments. As Chulalongkorn ascends the throne, 
the King dies, confident that his son will carry on in ways 
that he could not.

Children
Getting to know you, putting it my way,
But nicely,
You are precisely,

Anna
My cup of tea.

Louis
Mother, now that the King is dying, does that make you 
friends again.

Anna
I suppose so, Louis. We can't hurt each other anymore.

Louis
He'd always frightened me.

Anna
Oh I wish you had known him better. You two could have been
such good friends; in many ways, he was just as young as you.

Louis
Was he as good a King as he could have been?

Anna
I don't think any man has ever been as good a King as he 
could have been. But this one tried, he tried very hard.

Louis
You really liked him, didn't you, mother?

Anna
Yes, Louis, I liked him very much. Very much indeed.

Louis
Mother, it's the boat. It's time to go.

Anna
Louis, run down to the boat and ask Captain Northon to take
our things off. 

Louis
Yes, mother.

King
Several weeks I've not seen you, Misses Anna, and now I die.

Anna
No, your Majesty...

King
This is not scientific. I know when I die or do not die!
Misses Anna you take notes. You take note from next King.
Well, suppose you are a King, is there nothing you would do?

Prince
I would make proclamations!

King
Yes!

Prince
First I would proclaim for coming New Year fireworks!

King
Hmm...Hmm?

Prince
Also boat races!

King
Boat races? Why? Boat races in New Year's celebration?

Prince
I like boat races. And father, I would like to make a 
Second proclamation.

King
Yes, what is your second proclamation? Make it! Make it!

Prince
Regarding custom a-bowing to King, unfashionable at all.
I do not believe this is good thing. Causing embarrassing
To everybody, degrading experience or so, etecetara, 
etecetara, etecetara! And this bad thing, I believe. You 
are angry with me, my father?

King
Oh, why do you ask question? When you are a king, you are king!
You do not ask question of sick man, nor of woman! Misses Anna,
this proclamation against bowing to king, I believe to be your 
fault!

Anna
Oh I hope so, your Majesty! I do hope so!

Ensemble
He'll always need your love
And so he'll get your love-
A man who needs your love
Can be Wonderful.
