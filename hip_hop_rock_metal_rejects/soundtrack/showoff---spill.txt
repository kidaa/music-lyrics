Now it seems you wanna be the person that you used to be 
And everything it seems to me is just another thing called fate 
That's exactly what you're making 
Everyday you feel the same and everything gets in your brain 
And I don't think you'll find the places that you used to be called home 
This is how I feel about you 
I suffered everything 
You'll think you feel the same 
If you ever wanna be with me then think again 
Well, I don't care if you need me 
I question everything. 
Let me tell ya what I say 

Honey, I know it all 
Still you wonder if I'll stand or if I'll fall but 
Honey, I won't take the spill.
