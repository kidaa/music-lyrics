Thanks to Julie

I could stay awake just to hear you breathing 
Watch you smile while you are sleeping 
While you're far way in dreaming 
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender 
I could stay lost in this moment forever 
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep 
'Coz I'd miss u baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
Cuz even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Lying close to you 
Feeling your heart beating 
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming 
Wondering if it's me you're seeing 
Then I kiss your eyes 
And thank God were together 
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever 
Forever and ever 

I don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
'Coz I'd miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Coz even when I dream of you 
I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah 
I don't wanna miss a thing 
I don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
'Coz I'd miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Coz even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

I don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
'Coz I'd miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, 
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
don't wanna miss a thing 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
don't wanna miss a thing 
don't wanna miss a thing 
don't wanna miss a thing
