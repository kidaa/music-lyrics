She said "I'm fine, I'm okay" 
cover, up your trembling hands 
There's indecision when you 
Know you ain't got nothing left 
when the good times never stay 
And the cheap thrills always 
seem to fade away 

When will we 
When will we fall down 

Jump back, got to get out of here 
been too long this time 
Jump back, got to get out of here 
When will we fall down 

She hates her life 
She hates her skin 
She even hates her friends 
Tries to hold on to all the 
reputations she can't mend 
And there's some chance we could fail 
but the last time someone was 
always there for bail 
When will we fall down 

Jump back, got to get out of here 
been too long this time 
Jump back, got to get out of here 
When will we fall down 

For the last time conscience calls 
For a good friend I was never there at all 
When will we fall down
