Sunshine go away today
Don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone he's trying to run my life
Don't know what he's asking 

He tells me I better get in line
I can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up I'm gonna make him mine
Please help dude I'm in pain 

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we lost
I'll try it 

He can't even run his own life
Be damned if he'll run mine
Sunshine 

Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone he's trying to run my life
Don't know what he's asking
When working starts to make me wonder to wear
The feats are what I do, I'm going
He says in love and war all is fair
He's got cards he ain't showing 

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we lost
I'll try it 

He can't even run his own life
Be damned if he'll run mine
Sunshine
Sunshine go away today
I can't feel much like singing
And this old world, she's gonna turn around
The brand new bells will be a-ringing
