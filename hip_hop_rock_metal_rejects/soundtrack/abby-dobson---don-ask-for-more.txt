What do you say
When words are not enough 
Too few won't sum it up
Too many's just too much

I've read all the signs
But still don't know the way
I could try and lead you there
But I'd just lead you astray

Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
If you wanna be with me
'Cause the truth would set you free

Don't look too closely 
Or you'll see my disguise
I saw the love between us die
But I'm not ready for goodbye

Don't ask for more
'Cause what you're searching for
You won't find at my door
Don't ask for more
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go

Please try and understand
This is all I am
I keep holding on
But half of me is gone

The pieces of my heart
Are lying on the floor
It's been broken up before
It can't be broken anymore

Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
If you wanna be with me
'Cause the truth would set you free

Don't look too closely 
Or you'll see my disguise
I don't want to live a lie
But I can not say another goodbye

Don't ask for more
'Cause what you're searching for
You won't find at my door
Don't ask for more
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go

oooh... Another goodbye...
oooh... Another goodbye

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies
If you wanna be with me - 'cause the truth would set you free

Don't look too closely 
Or you'll see my disguise
I don't wanna live a lie
But I can not say another goodbye

Don't ask for more
'Cause what you are searching for - you won't find at my door
My heart already knows
But my head won't let you go
repeat

oooh... Another goodbye
oooh... Another goodbye

Another goodbye.
