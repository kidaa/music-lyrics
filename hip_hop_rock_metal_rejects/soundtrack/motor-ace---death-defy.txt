Starting to get my head in your space 
Starting to lose track of the weekdays 
Starting to cook my brain in five ways 
I'm trying to be cool 

Starting to lose my inhibitions 
Starting to make some bad decisions 
I'm listening to all your crap opinions 
I'm trying to be cool 

Don't take me over 
Just take me there 
Like I planned 

I've gone as far as I could go 
And now the feeling's starting to take hold 
But I'll death defy to make you cry 
And find out what you know 
Would you please death defy with me too 

Starting to tune in to your station 
Starting to lose my obligation 
I'm talking in tongues and celebration 
Trying to be cool 

Starting to get my head in your space 
Starting to lose track of the weekdays 
Starting to cook my brain in five ways 
I'm trying to be cool
