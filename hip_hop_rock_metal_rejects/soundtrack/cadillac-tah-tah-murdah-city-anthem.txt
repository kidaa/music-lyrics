[Verse One] 
Now everybody just BOUNCE! BOUNCE! 
My Pov City hustlers, BOUNCE! BOUNCE! 
All my hood slimies, and Prada mamis 
See how we fall off in the club, its nuttin but love 
Plenty bottles of skimy twisted and stick bud 
And it fifty-fifty love, all across the board dog 
Gully respect Gully never floss for broads 
or, get out of my character when she back it up 
And after somethin good performs, I'll have you get up on it 
Ma, I'll give it how you want it, make you a new lady 
Coke'll open her crazy, now all day she two way me 
Type of shit like "ohh baby", everything you do is gravy 
And models I'm hittin lately, so all you can do is hate me 
Stare me down and screw face me, hype ya man up to lace me 
C'mon, all y'all buttersoft, sweeter then tasties 
My hands grip two hammers, double action 
Prime time, nigga minus the actin 

[Chorus]
NOW GET YA MUTHAFUCKIN HANDS UP! High, touch the sky 
And if you holdin weight, nigga get it up 
Mamis in the club lookin right; oh you ain't spendin the night? 
Give her the pin number, mami hit me up 
We can SkyTel tag until I get you in the back of the Jag 
After we burn a bag, I'ma hit the guts 
Oh you a baller? Then ball to this 
My pimps, gangstas, and dogs I ain't mad at you player, play on 

[Verse Two] 
Now hear me holla out GANGSTA, GANGSTA 
PAPER CHASER - I love the cake 
And petit mamis with the coke bottle shape 
So keep shakin that money maker, ma-ma I can't hate ya 
Its a cold world, ol' girl -  so take advice from a pimp 
What I'm spittin is venomus ism listen 
When the chrome rims glistenin, on the 'llac truck 
Traffic get backed up - we in this, cloud of smoke from spinach 
Niggaz ain't big enough to go some rounds or minutes 
I'm heavyweight, and I ain't speakin bought pounds in fitness 
Use to spit off for sport but now its business 
When you see me holla like you know me and I ain't scared homie 
Picked up the mic, and put down the gats and yo 
Now I rap and blow, with a fire acid flow 
You know, and dog I ain't gotta repeat it 
Right in front of ya eyes, ya see it, the best kept secret 

[Chorus]

[Verse Three] 
Now everybody just ride.. 
If you sittin on dubs, in that big body rollin a bud 
Then get high.. uhh, get it crunk 
Murda.. gangster love 
Now you know its only right and necessary 
that I smash Freddy, after spittin heavy - bars 
Methaphors god, my shit is deadly 
Swift and better believe I'm focused now 
Feed you to the vultures, murderous poster child 
Click, clak, BLAOW! The pound sure to drop 
Then catch me full of that hall or, blowin on them poppers 
But love, livin and, love them, thug, women 
who will hustle and grind when its hard times 
Playa, we came in this game with no gimmicks 
You're finished, diminshed ya frame get holes in it 
Straight business and +No Limits+, like Master P 
So if you bout that, scrilla my nilla then stack them cheese 
And twist up, burn the vanilla dutch, we live it up 
No bread, dick and Big Red we givin sluts 
I'm just a villian, willin to kill for that pot of gold 
You gotta know, its all for the dough 

[Chorus]

[Cadillac Tah] 
Yeah, its a playa event nigga 
All my players ya heard me

Heart of the grungy, cheddar boys, mercy 
Yeah, it's goin down nigga
