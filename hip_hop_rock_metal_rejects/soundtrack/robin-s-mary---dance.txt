We want everybody to get up this evening 
Have a good time, turn the music up, yeah

Woot, woot Yeah, yeah, yeah

[rap] 
Check it 
Dance, everybody down with us 
Just dance, coming through the room and clap 
Your hands, they ask who's best tonight 
I am, God's been good to me 
Never to be too late and continuously 
He's great, he's on time even if I have to sit and wait 

[Robin S.] 
Sitting in the corner reminiscing bout 
The course my life has taken 
All my ups and all my downs 
With your mercy and grace 
Has brought me to this place 

When I think of what He's done 
I can dance, dance, dance 
All day, all night 
C'mon stand, clap your hands 

Trials and pain, temptations reign 
I never see how I'm gonna make it through on my own 
Not a chance, so I have to turn to you 
When you come and rescue me 
Once again and again 
So right now, all I can do 
Is give you thanks, yeah 

Repeat 1 

It's alright, it's okay 
C'mon clap your hands 
Give Him praise, give Him praise 
Go ahead just stand up 
C'mon shout and dance 
Give Him praise, give Him praise 

Repeat 1 til end of song
