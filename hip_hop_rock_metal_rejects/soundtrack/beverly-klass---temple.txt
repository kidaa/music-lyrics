the lyrics

We're pure intangible love
You asked what I found in you
I burn inside myself
While the tempest returns
It's been years I would say
The night has lived too long
Oh, I will find a way
We'll stand in the sun 

Where all our love resides
Where the dissonance seems to die
Oh, I will meet you there
We'll stand together
Where the daylight falls and fades
Your love lives in the sun
Oh, I will pass your way
This stands forever 

You found eternity
Oh, this could shatter your heart
The reflection of your soul
Was a vision of me
Take all that I could be
Take all I should be
May faith lead your way
Did you know it was me 

Where all our love resides
Where the desonance seems to die
Oh, I will meet you there
We'll stand together
Where the daylight falls and fades
Your love lives in the sun
Oh, I will pass your way
This stands forever 

Where all our love resides
Where the dissonance seems to die
Oh, I will meet you there
We'll stand together
Where the daylight falls and fades
Your love lives in the sun
Oh, I will pass your way
This stands forever
