I can't stand the way that you make me 
I feel pressure 
I can't stop the way that you take me 
I feel pressure release me 
I can't stop the way that you place me 
Under pressure release me 

The sound flew in the bare room 
The ride's no longer spare 
And time will always fall apart 
In a house where they don't care 
We fantasized your life 
And recognized the sins 
But it's tit for tat 
You take the rap 
Now it's me that's going to win 

I can't stand the way that you make me 
I feel pressure 
I can't stop the way that you place me 
Under pressure 

You've got chalk on the sidewalk, 
And the telephone always rings 
I'd rip the cord out, pull the wire out, 
Kick it on the shins 
You paralyzed the gold mine 
And the trains are standing still 
They pull you back and now you're trapped 
As they move in for the kill 

I can't stand the way that you make me 
I feel pressure 
I can't stop the way that you place me 
Under pressure 
I can't stand the day that you wake me 
I feel pressure release me 
I can't stand the way that you break me 
Under pressure release me 

Everytime I walk out in the sun 
The rain will come and really cry 

Release me 

We found you in the spare room 
With your eyes no longer there 
The lamp flex led up to your heart 
Like a diver's cord for air 
We electrolyzed your mind 
And analyzed your limbs 
Escapist rap, I've had all that 
Now it's me that's going to win 

I can't stand the way that you make me 
I feel pressure 
I can't stop the way that you place me 
Under pressure 
I can't stand the day that you wake me 
I feel pressure release me 
I can't stand the way that you break me 
Under pressure release me 

I can't stand the way you disgrace me 
I feel pressure release me 
I can't stand the way that you hate me 
I feel pressure release me 

Everytime I walk out in the sun 
The rain will come and really cry 

Now I can't be me at all 
Now I can't be me at all 
Now I can't be me at all
