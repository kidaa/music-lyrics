I listen to myself
It could be anything it could be 
Anything that I'm after 
I turn the radio on 
I've got no time to waste 
Counting down through my lucky numbers 5 4 3 2 1 
And now the damage is done
We gotta head for the sun 
And now the damage is done
We gotta head for the sun 
Still got the timing machines that keep our noses clean 
This place is a mess 
So let's leave it out on the launching pad 
You shouldn't take it so bad 
I wouldn't see it if I don't believe it 
The count down has begun 5 4 3 2 and 1 
We gotta head for the sun 
Now the damage is done 
We gotta head for the sun 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun 
The count down has begun 5 4 3 2 and 1 
We gotta head for the sun 
Now the damage is done 
We gotta head for the sun
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
