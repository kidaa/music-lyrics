A Friday night in April 1975. Backstage at an after-hours club in Saigon. 
Vietnamese bar-girls are getting into costumes.

GIRLS
one of us will be Miss Saigon

ENGINEER
I spread the word - it's Miss Saigon

GIGI
who's left to screw who hasn't gone

ENGINEER
shut up! and get your hot pants on

GIGI
each day more GI's disappear

ENGINEER
there's still some left and they'll all be here

ALL GIRLS
a girl can trust the Engineer

THE ENGINEER brings in a new girl, KIM

ENGINEER
surprise!
I found this new girl, get her dressed
from the country untouched

GIGI
just give that virgin act a rest

ALL GIRLS
mocking the new girl
"you are my first American"

they laugh

ENGINEER
allez! allez! allez!
why does it take all day?
get your asses on stage... I'm raising cash tonight

GIRLS 
tonight I will be Miss Saigon

ENGINEER
they say Saigon has weeks
I say it's time to pack

GIRLS
tonight I will be Miss Saigon

ENGINEER 
each day these little buns of theirs are worth less and less
I need a visa fast, and I'm not looking back

the ENGINEER looks through the door into the club.

ENGINEER
son of a bitch, they're here!
I can still engineer
it's like the old days, my little gamines

GIRLS
oh sure!

ENGINEER
you know who's out here? a gang of marines!

GIRLS
they're here?

ENGINEER
we'll pick 'em clean that's what this contest's about

GIRLS
yes, sir!

ENGINEER
one of these boys might be your ticket out

turns to KIM

why is she in that dress?
ah! it's my new princess
ah, yes!
a bride will give the guys a treat
lower your eyelids and play sweet
men pay the moon to get fresh meat

allez! allez! allez!
get out and do your song!
don't make the show too long

voila'! on stage all! welcome to...
Dreamland!!!
