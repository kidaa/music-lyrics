All our times -- have come, 
Here but now -- they're gone. 

Seasons don't fear the reaper, 
Nor do the wind, 
the sun or the rain So come on baby, don't fear the reaper 
Take my hand don't fear the reaper 
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
Cause baby, I'm your man...
Baby, I'm your man...
Valentine -- is done, 
Here but now -- they're gone. 

Romeo and Juliet, 
Are together in eternity Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday like Romeo and Juliet
Another 40,000 everyday we can be like they are 
So come on baby don't fear the reaper 
Take my hand don't fear the reaper 
We'll be able to fly don't fear the reaper
Cause baby, I'm your man... 
Baby, I'm your man... 

Romeo and Juliet, 
Are together in eternity Romeo and Juliet 
So come on baby don't fear the reaper 
Take my hand don't fear the reaper 
We'll be able to fly don't fear the reaper 
Baby, I'm your man... 
Baby, I'm your man...
