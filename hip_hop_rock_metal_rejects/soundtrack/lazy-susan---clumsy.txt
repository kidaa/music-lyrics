Wilson/Lazy Susan

I keep falling down the stairs and walking down the wrong way.
You try and meet me there and I tell you it's a long way.
I fall apart at the seams, I forget my dreams, I never know what to say.
Can't wake up in the morning, 'cos you got me falling.
Could you be clumsy like me for a day, would I ever know the difference?
And I would I care anyway?
I slam my finger in the door. I don't know who to follow.
You try and tell me more and I find it hard to swallow.
I fall apart at the seams, I forget my dreams, I never know what to say.
Can't wake up in the morning, 'cos you got me falling.
Could you be clumsy like me for a day, would I ever know the difference?
And I would I care anyway?
You got me falling.
