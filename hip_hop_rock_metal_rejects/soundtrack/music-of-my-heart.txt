From Music of the Heart soundtrack 
'N Sync   Gloria Estefan 


You'll never know
What you've done for me
What your faith in me
Has done for my soul...

You'll never know
The gift you've given me..
I'll carry it with me yeah...yeah...

Through the days ahead
I think of days before
You made me hope for something better yes you did
And made me reach for something more

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Help me hear the music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes
You've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love...
love
Is the music of my heart.. music of my heart

You were the one
Always on my side always on my side
Always standing by always standing by
Seeing me through

You were the song that always made me sing
I'm singing this for you singing this for you baby

Everywhere I go
I think of where I've been think of where I've been
And of the one who knew me better
Than anyone ever will again

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Help me hear the music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes
You've opened the door you opened the door
To something I've never known before...
And your love...your love
Is the music of my heart

What you taught me
Only your love could ever teach me
You got through when no one could reach me
Ohh...ohh...ohh

Cause you always saw in me
All the best that I could be
It was you who set me free...

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside me inside
Help me hear the music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside me inside
Help me hear the music of my heart music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes
You've opened the door opened the door
To something I've never known before never, never, felt before
And your love...
Is the music of my heart..
