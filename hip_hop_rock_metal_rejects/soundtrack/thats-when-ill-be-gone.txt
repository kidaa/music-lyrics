Ohhhhh hey yaaaa
mamma oh ohohoh 

Girl you don't think really know me 
But you're afraid to trust me
Stop doubting my intentions
Why? Why don't you believe me
There must be something, that you don't wanna metion

I said I shouted from the mountain top
My never ending love that's what you've got

When the sun don't shine
And the moon won't glow
When the rain don't fall
When the wind don't blow
When the earth won't spin
And you're standing still 
That's when I'll be gone
I ain't going nowhere
Not if you won't be there
I ain't going nowhere without you 

You, you're my inspiration
My only motivation 
I have I never needed
Dreams, you know I doubt I'll be there
you and me forever
let me just repeat it
I told you , you can always count on me
What can I do to get your mind at me

When the sun don't shine
And the moon won't glow
When the rain don't fall
When the wind don't blow
When the earth won't spin
And you're standing still
That's when I'll be gone

When the rivers dry
And the oceans part or pond oceans part or pond 
When there's not one fear
In a single heart single heart
And that's when I'll stop
Stop loving you
That's when I'll be gone

I ain't going nowhere
not if you won't be there
I ain't going nowhere without you

When the stars disappear 
That's when I won't be near or there 
I knew the day I saw you
I'll alwayz be there for you
make no mistake and or baby that's when love is here

Ohh Ohh wooo yea yea yeaaaa

When the sun don't shine
And the moon won't glow
WHen the rain don't fall
When the wind don't blow
When the earth won't spin
And you're standing still 
That's when I'll be gone that's when I'll be gone

I ain't going nowhere 
Not if you won't be there
I ain't going nowhere without you 
When the rivers dry
And the oceans part oceans part 

When there's not one fear
In a single heart single heart
And that's when I'll stop
Stop loving you
That's when I'll be gone
