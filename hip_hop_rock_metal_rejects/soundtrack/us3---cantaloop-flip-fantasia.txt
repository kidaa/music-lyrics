Ladies and
Gentlemen, as you know we have something
special for you at
Birdland this evening.
A recording for
Blue Note Records

What's that? yeah
yeah yeah
funky funky, how
bout a big hand now?
wait, wait a minute

Groovy groovy
jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic
sea, the rhythm keeps flowin, it drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop
sugar pop rocks it pops ya dont stop
Till the sweet
beat drops
I show and prove
as a stick in move
Hear the poems
recited on top of the groove
Smooth, mind,
floating like a butterfly
Notes start to
float, suttle like a lullabye
Brace yourself as
the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip
fantasia

ah, ah, ah,
what's that? biggity biggity bop

Feel the beat
drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin in the
dome, and mix is on the lock
Funk and fusion, a
fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin
on the river we cruisin
Up down round and
round, round the found
But nevertheless
ya gots to get down
Finesse the freak
thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet,
the sweat from the heat

Back to the fact
I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the
rhymes, some would call me a poet
Funky flowin goin
on with the sweet sound
Caught in the
groove in Fantasia I'm found
Trip the tour upon
the rhymes they soar
To an infinite
height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I
take ya
Dip trip flip
fantasia

Jump to the jam
boogy woogy jam slam
Bust the dialect
im the man in command
Come flow with the
sounds of the mighty mic masta
When I rhyme on
the mic I bring a sucka disasta
Beaucoup bucks and
I still rock Nike
With the razzle
dazzle star I might be
Scribble scrabble
on the microphone I babble
As I flip the
funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on
and on as I flex
Get with the flow
words manifest
Feel the vibe from
here to Asia
Dip trip flip
fantasia

I've found it. At last.
Put it on.
