You're just too good to be true. 
I Can't take my eyes off of you. 
You'd be like heaven to touch. 
Boy I wanna hold you so much. 
At long last love has arrived. 
And I thank the stars I'm alive. 
Oh you're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off of you. 

? it's true I declare 
Oh there's nothing else to compare. 
The thought of you leaves me weak. 
There's no words left to speak. 
But if you feel like I feel. 
Then let me know that it's real. 
Oh you're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off of you. 

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right, 
I need you baby to warm the lonely night. 
I love you baby. 
Trust in me when I say: 
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray. 
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you. 
Stay and let me love you, baby. 
Let me love you 

You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off of you. 
You'd be like heaven to touch. 
Boy I wanna hold you so much. 
At long last love has arrived. 
And I thank the stars I'm alive. 
You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off of you. 

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right, 
I need you baby to warm the lonely night. 
I love you baby. 
Trust in me when I say: 
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray. 
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you. 
Stay and let me love you, baby. 
Let me love you 

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right, 
I need you baby to warm the lonely night. 
I love you baby. 
Trust in me when I say
