He's a fool and don't I know it 
But a fool can have his charms 
I'm in love and don't I show it 
Like a babe in arms 

I'm wild but not impatient 
Men were not a new sensation 
Couldn't sleep, and wouldn't sleep 
When love told me I shouldn't sleep 
Loving and hugging you know it 
I'm in love and don't I show it 
Like a babe in arms 

Chorus: 
I'm wild again, beguiled again 
A simpering, whimpering child again 
Bewitched, bothered and, bewildered am I 

My heart was lost, I paid the cost 
Cold from the start he played the part 
I must agree the laughs on me 
But he and I we were meant to be 
Anticipating, loving, hating, waiting 
What am I to do 
Bewildered and bewitched 
'Cause I'm so bothered over you 

Chorus 

Just the same old sad sensation 
That's the way love feels 
And this half-pint imitation 
Has my head over my heels 
Wishin' and missin' you kissin' 
What am I to think 
Bothered and bewildered 
I can't sleep a wink 

Chorus 
My heart was lost I paid the cost 
Cold from the start 

I've seen a lot, I mean a lot 
But I like sweet seventeen a lot 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 
I'm wild but not impatient 
Men are not a new sensation 
Lovin' and huggin' you know it 
I'm in love and don't I show it
