Thanks to Julia James for submitting       
the lyrics

It's sad and spent 
Feel the motion again 
Stop and pause 
Then move some more 

Still surprise you when it shatters 
But nothing matters 
Still surprise you when it shatters 
Don't you know that nothing happens 
But a lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 

Choose a town 
Find a girl to follow around 
Stay on track 
And just sit back 

Still surprise you when it shatters 
But nothing matters 
Still surprise you when it shattered 
Don't you know that nothing happens 
But a lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
But a lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens 
A lot goes on 
A lot goes on 
But nothing happens
