Some things come to he who waits
but all is lost if you hesitate
And I was never one to wait
you'll know you were loved

You can hire great lawyers, you can speak to your friends
you can say he did this and that some things don't change
Unwrap the present and burn the remains
but you'll know you were loved

Now you take Roscoe, he ain't much
people say things are ruined after his touch
It's like a tar was dripping from his brush
but you'll know you were loved

Or Stan or Jake emerging from your past
from those love affairs that didn't last
But me, I'll give it my last gasp
and you'll know you were loved

A parrot, a donkey, a dog, a bone
some of us never had a home
And if we did we left it long ago
and didn't know we were loved

Empty as a wooden clock
left in the woods at twelve o'clock
Insides all rusted and spring is popped
but you'll know you were loved

Even when you sleep at night
inside your heart will cry
You can never say goodbye
when you know you were loved

Under-achievers of the world unite
You have nothing to lose except your fright
And together we can perhaps past the night
when you know you were loved

And together we can perhaps past the night
when you know you were loved
