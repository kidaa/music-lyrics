I hate to talk like this 
I hate to act as if there's something wrong 
But I can't say I have this dream at night almost every night 
I've been dreaming it forever 
It's easy to remember, it's always cold always day always here 
Always say I'm alright I'll be okay 
If I can keep myself awake keep myself awake... 
I get up early and look around me 
And can't help but wonder what you mean 
But I'm sleeping I'm so deep in 
So much more real to me closer than reality 
It's always cold always day always here 
Always say I'm alright I'll be okay 
If I can keep myself awake keep myself awake... 
I get up early I look around me 
I'm buying coffee by the pound 
But I'm sleeping so deep in it 
I can't keep myself awake keep myself awake...
