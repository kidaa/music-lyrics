Kyle's mom is a bitch, she's a big fat bitch 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world 
She's a stupid bitch, if there ever was a bitch 
She's a bitch to all the boys and girls! 

Monday she's a bitch 
On Tuesday she's a bitch
On Wednesdays and Saturdays she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different
She's a super king kamaya maya beeeyotch! 


Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world 
Shes a mean old bitch, and she has stupid hair 
She's a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch... 
Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 

She's a stupid bitch 
Kyle's mom's a bitch 
And she's just a dirty bitch! 


Talk to kids around the world and it might go a little bit something like this!
