There's a boy, there's a boy
He really turns my world
Round and round.
Can we be, can we be
Like two birds in a tree
Free and found ?
Who's to know which way it will go.
Sister sun, sister sun
You know who is the one
To brighten your sky.
Mister moon, mister moon
Yeh you in your balloon
Don't let it all go by.
Who's to know which way it will go.
My dreamship. 
Run baby run, grab whatever you can.
