[Verse 1:]
When I look in your eyes
I see a whole different sky
Like I've never seen before
And when I hear your voice
It's like a song that I can
Listen to o', over again

[Pre-chorus 1:]
It's so crazy how you make me go crazy
Every time that I'm near you

[Chorus 1:]
Cause you're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
You're just a dream
Just a dream

[Verse 2:]
When I picture the world
It takes me to the sun
I think about the way you smile
And the words that you say
Always seem to change
The world that I've been living in

[Pre-chorus 2:]
It's so crazy how you make me go crazy
Every time that I'm near you

[Chorus:]
Cause you're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
You're just a dream
Just a dream
You're just a dream
Just a dream yeah

[Bridge:]
More than my imagination could ever see
You're just a dream
If I could be with you

[Chorus:]
You're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
Cause You're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
Be with you
You're just a dream
Oh whoa you're just a dream
Just a dream
