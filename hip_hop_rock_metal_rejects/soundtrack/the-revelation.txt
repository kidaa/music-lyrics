After the conference, JOHN introduces CHRIS and ELLEN to his co-
workers. CHRIS draws JOHN aside.

CHRIS 
John, you were great. Can I see you alone?
I gotta know what you meant on the phone
what is this news you received you can only tell me

JOHN
a lot of groups use my Bangkok staff
to process problems on their behalf
we got this in from the embassy
it's not easy to tell you, it's best that you see

CHRIS
Kim. it's about Kim, isn't it?
only you now how hard I had tried to get word
tell me first, nothing else, tell me: did she survive?

JOHN
you must read the report, Chris, but yes, she's alive

CHRIS
you don't know, John, these nightmares, the things that I've seen
I have seen her face burned, seen her shot with my gun
I have chased her through streets and heard nothing but screams
what's wrong? Come on. There is still something more

JOHN
she has a child
you have a son

shows CHRIS the report

CHRIS
you won't believe me but I dreamed this, John
it's in the nightmare when I see Saigon
Jesus, John, I am married
is this story for real?

JOHN
I'm only telling you what I received
but our reports can usually be believed
Kim's a bar-girl in Bangkok
pal, I know how you feel

CHRIS
It's too late! I have a whole new life
I have a wife I love, she just can't disappear

JOHN
listen, guy, I know the shock you've had
it isn't always bad, there are solutions here

CHRIS
oh John, I never told her
my wife, how can I tell her?
a child, what do I do?
I shattered Kim
now Ellen too

JOHN CHRIS
I have learned the best thing for a couple to do I have to tell her
you should both come to Bangkok, I mean Ellen too I have to tell her

CHRIS
us both?

JOHN
you both should go!

ELLEN
hey guys, come on

CHRIS
but first . . . Ellen has to know
