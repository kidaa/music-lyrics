Chewin' on my raisinettes 
Thinkin' bout what I want next 
Thinking maybe I'm addicted 
Checking out my pay per view 
All I do is think of you 
What's wrong baby, with this picture 
Cause love is just too much work 
Never shoulda lingered over dessert 

CHORUS 
You're the fever of my night 
The dream I just can't fight 
Everytime I try - busted 
You're the shiver up my spine 
Can't keep my cool in line 
You catch my eye - busted 

Love reigns supreme 
But never over me 
That's how I've always operated 
What's that thing we had 
Up in your bachelor pad 
Left me so intoxicated 
Love is just too much pain 
Never shoulda gave you my number and name 

CHORUS 

Don't want somebody to love 
Just want somebody to like me 
Don't want somebody too close 
Just want somebody beside me 
Don't want somebody too much, nothing complicated 
Don't want somebody too much, too much, too much 

CHORUS
