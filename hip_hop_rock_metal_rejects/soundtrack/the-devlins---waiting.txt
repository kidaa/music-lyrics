Waiting at the station,
waiting for the right moves,
waiting in the basement,
waiting for the right cues,
waiting in a daydream,
waiting in the slipstream

waiting...
waiting in the right bars, 
waiting in the right shoes,
waiting in a fast car, 
waiting in the airports,

waiting for my airmiles,
waiting in slow motion, 
coming through the turnstiles.

 And if you ever change your mind,
you know I'm hard to find,
and if you ever need someone...

I'll still be waiting...
Waiting with the orphans, waiting for the bee stings, they tell me that success brings,
waiting in the half light, waiting for your whole life, 
waiting for an ideal...a low deal...a no deal, to play your stereotype.
And if you ever find the time,
you know I'm not far behind,
And if you ever need someone...

I'll still be waiting...
just waiting for a friend.
I say it's alright,
It's alright my friend...just waiting.
