Hey, Alice are you completely 
Satisfied with Wonderland 
And all it's wonder? 
Cause if you're not, you know I 
Heard that they're handing out a 
money-back guarantee at the door. 

Going blind to the pain, 
Going deaf to the sight, 
Going down to the cry, 
Of the innocent life. 

I read the paper, 
And I drank all the juice 
In my refridgerator, now I'm 
Starved for knowledge, 
Thirsty for the truth. 
And in the pages I could 
Sense all the longing in the world 
I close my eyes, cause I'm longing too. 

Going blind to the pain, 
Going deaf to the sight, 
Going down to the cry, 
Of the innocent life. 

Who knows your name, 
anymore, anymore? 
I'll say your name, 
forever more, forever more. 

Blind to the pain, 
Going deaf to the sight, 
Going down to the cry, 
Of the innocent life, 
Of the innocent life.
