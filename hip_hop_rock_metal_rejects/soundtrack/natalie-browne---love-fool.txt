Love me love me 
Fool me fool me 
Love me love me 
Leave me leave me 
Love me love me 
Say that you love me 
Fool me fool me 
Go on and fool me 
Love me love me 
Pretend that you need me 
Leave me leave me 
Just say that you need me 

Dear I fear we're facing a problem 
You love me no longer I know and 
Now nothing I can do 
To make you stay 
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother 
That I ought to stick to another man 
A man who surely deserves me 
but I think you do 
So I cry and I pray and I beg 

Love me love me 
Say that you love me 
Fool me fool me 
Go on and fool me 
Love me love me 
Pretend that you love me 
Leave me leave me 
Just say that you need me 
Love me love me 
Say that you love me 
Fool me fool me 
Go on and fool me 
Love me love me 
Pretend that you love me 
Leave me leave me 
Just say that you need me 

I don't care 'bout anything but you 
Lately I had desperately pondered 
Spent my nights awake and I wondered 
What I could have done in another way 
To make you stay 
Reason will not lead to solution 
I will end up lost in confusion 
I don't care if you really care 
As long as you don't go 
So I cry and I pray and I beg 

Love me love me 
Say that you love me 
Fool me fool me 
Go on and fool me 
Love me love me 
Pretend that you love me 
Leave me leave me 
Just say that you need me 
Love me love me 
Say that you love me 
Fool me fool me 
Go on fool me 
Love me love me 
I know that you'll leave me 
Leave me leave me 
Just say that you need me 

Anything but you 
Anything but you 
Anything but you 
Anything but you 
Anything but you 
Anything but you 
Anything but you 
Anything but
