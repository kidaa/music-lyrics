Go son. If you get up but they strap you around.
Then just remember that i will always be there. 
when i say to you daddy loves you understand. 
i'm out in the real world again im trying. 
raise your guard again. they dont give a damn. 
dont compromise your ideas for anyone else. 
respect your mom and always think of her first. 
when i say to you daddy loves you 
understand i'm out in the real world again and i'm trying. 
raise your guard again. they dont give a damn. 
Son, if the sun don't shine i'll try 
like hell to make light from the dark for you. 
raise your guard again. they dont give a damn. go son.
