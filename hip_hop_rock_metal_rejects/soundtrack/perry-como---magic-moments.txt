Magic, moments, 
When two hearts are carin', 
Magic, moments, 
Memories we've been sharin' . . . 
I'll never forget the moment we kissed, 
The night of the hayride, 
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm, 
While takin' a sleigh ride. 
Magic, moments, 
Memories we've been sharin', 
Magic, moments, 
When two hearts are carin' . . . 
Time can't erase the memory of, 
These magic, moments, 
Filled with love! 
whistling . . . 
The telephone call that tied up the line, 
For hours and hours, 
The Saturday dance, I got up the nerve, 
To send you some flowers. 
Magic, moments, 
Memories we've been sharin', 
Magic, moments, 
When two hearts are carin' . . . 
Time can't erase the memory of, 
These magic, moments, 
Filled with love! 
The way that we cheered, 
Whenever our team, 
Was scoring a touchdown! 
The time that the floor, 
Fell out of my car, 
When I put the clutch down! 
The penny arcade, 
The games that we played, 
The fun and the prizes! 
The Halloween hop, 
When everyone came, 
In funny disguises. 
Magic, moments, 
Filled with love! 
whistling . . .
