I seen the demons 
But they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me 
But I lay upon the ground 

I seen the people 
But they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me 
But I gave the run-around 

I reached for feelings 
But they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me 
But I lay upon the ground 

So 
Miles and miles of squares 
Where's the feeling there? 
Still nobody cares 
For miles and miles of squares 

Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 
Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 

I seen the demons 
But they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me 
But I lay upon the ground 

I seen the people 
But they didn't make a sound 
They tried to reach me 
But I gave the run-around 

Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 
Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 

So 
Miles and miles of squares 
Where's the feeling there? 
Still nobody cares 
For miles and miles of squares 

Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 
Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 
Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers 
Daydream... I found 'em sleeping with the flowers
