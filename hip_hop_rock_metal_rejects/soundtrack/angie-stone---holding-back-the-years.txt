From Love   Basketball Soundtrack

Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah, uh-huh

Listen
Holding back the years
Thinking about the fear I've had so long
Will somebody here listen
Listen to the fear that's gone

Strangled by the wishes I begged for
Hoping for the unmade for
To get to me the sooner or later
Oh Lord

Ooh
Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I know
And uh holding back the tears yeah
Cause nothing here is wrong, oh Lord

I've wasted all my tears yeah
Ain't no reason, no
Wasted all those years
Too many, too many they just go by
Nothing had the chance to be good, no, no
Nothing ever could, oh no

But I'll keep holding on
Gotta keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Never let go no, no, no
I'll keep holding on
Gotta keep holding on
I'll keep holding on

Take your time, take your time
Suga take your time
Take your time
Take your time, take your time
Suga take your time
Take your time

Oh now
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those, those lonely, lonely years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could

I'll keep holding on
Gotta keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Never let go no, no, no
I'll keep holding on
Gotta keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Gotta just keep, keep
Keep holding on
No matter how tired 
Gotta just keep, keep
Keep pressing on
As weary as it may seem... repeat 4x

Think it's a love song
Pull back, pulsate
Gonna keep holding on
Never, never, never let go
Oh yeah
I'll keep holding on
