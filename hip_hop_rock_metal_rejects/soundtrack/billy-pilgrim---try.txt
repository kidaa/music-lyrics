Another sleepless night, turn off my light 
turn it off 
Open my books, take in silence, 
and wait for the dawn 
Lock myself into place 
Keep the sun off my face 
When the morning comes 
TRY to keep it all in sight 

Form one thought, break it off, take a breath, 
carry on 
You think you matter so much 
that you're the only one 
In your mind you're a star 
that I can see from afar 
Before you've even begun 
to TRY to keep it all in sight 
If you feel it then open your heart 
No need to ask it what for 
Blood runs cold when it's shut from the sun 
So open your door and what's more, TRY 

Worked for years on their temples 
to burn them all down 
An angry horde disbelievin' set fire sacred ground 
In its place they built tanks 
Think, fish, and drunk tanks 
And just to tear the sky down 
They tried to conquer all in sight 
Walled their cities as hight as they could 
Kept them apart from themselves 
Fought for ages and raged on the plains 
with reasons misunderstood 
but to the common good 
Raised up their idols proteced their own walked on dinosaur bones 
Spread a pestilent nature from mountain to sky 
Until the rivers ran dry 
and the rivers ran dry 
that they owned 

Watch the lights flash by my window 
Throw ghosts on the wall 
And every room in my house 
answers back when I call 
Trace the outline within 
Trust in dreams to begin 
TRY to keep it all in sight 
And TRY to work it all out 
TRY if you will, TRY if they won't 
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't 
TRY
