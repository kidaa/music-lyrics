{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}
{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}
{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}

{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}
{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}
{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}
{Ain't nothin' but a party y'all}

Well, a dang diggy, won't you get jiggy
With the mad scientist Mr. Doolittle
If this here's the party we're the VIP
To the left, right, or any side of me

Just do it till your satisfied, ain't no difference
G-style party crowd is all upliftin'
Fingers poppin', people lockin'
Woo-hah You know Sugarhill ain't stoppin'
So children keep screamin' and dreamin'
How you think we got the spotlight beamin'
On stage while I-Roc rhyme
All about the nation, primetime but you got to find
Solutions to work around the Constitution
And get up off that thang and keep movin', uh
Get caught up in the 9 to 5
But for now party over here, gotta try

{As I look into the crowd tell me what I see}
What?
{Ain't nothin' but a party, ain't nothin' but a party}
Till the break of dawn

As I look into the crowd tell me what I see
Everybody on the dance floor bout to party
To the early What? morning break of dawn
Like a hot big bag of butter popcorn

Jump, bump, hump, push it
Ain't nothin' but a party bustin' out your crush
So throw your hands in the air, uh-huh
And wave em round like you care
Now if I said to you for One Time always spoke to the truth
At 12 rockin' parties out the DJ booth
From the bottom of the floor, up out the roof
I was the one who had the dog rockin' out the with goose Woof
Just like a dog, yes, y'all, we got a cat in the middle
Freakin' around and around, shakin' her tail a little
Now everybody say, Ho till it's gotten to flow
You paid to get in, now let me start up the show
Okay, introducin' a star never losin'
Low budget to high budget, guess what I'm cruisin'
Ain't nobody dumpin', so let's keep it bumpin'
Or somethin' before One Time pulls in

{As I look into the crowd tell me what I see}
What?
{Ain't nothin' but a party, ain't nothin' but a party}
Till the break of dawn

As I look into the crowd tell me what I see
Everybody on the dance floor bout to party
To the early What? morning break of dawn
Like a hot big bag of butter popcorn

I left with the slide, now I'm back with the dip
Ever since the youth I was granted this gift
Hey, yo' up jumped the boogie to the boogie bang-bang
I paused for a second, now I'm back in the game
On a 360 spin like I'm up on a axis
Fresh females still best about dancin'
They call us Sugarhill cause we famous
So hey Mr. DJ won't you play this
Bump for Life Long Entertainment
We bump it from the ceilin' to the pavement
Counter-clock five, straight hypnotize
Under the sun, when it falls, till it rise
Focus with no Hocus-Pocus
Tipsy like a gypsy when I spoke this
Wrote this only for the hyperactive
Blacks, Whites, I can't forget the Latins

{As I look into the crowd tell me what I see}
What?
{Ain't nothin' but a party, ain't nothin' but a party}
Till the break of dawn

As I look into the crowd tell me what I see
Everybody on the dance floor bout to party
To the early What? morning break of dawn
Like a hot big bag of butter popcorn

Yes, yes y'all, Sugarhill y'all
Sugarhill y'all, ya don't stop
Another mark y'all, another mark y'all
To the beat y'all, ya don't stop
Sugarhill y'all, Sugarhill y'all
Be the beat y'all, ya don't stop
Another mark y'all, another mark y'all
Another mark y'all, come on

{As I look into the crowd tell me what I see}
What?
{Ain't nothin' but a party, ain't nothin' but a party}
Till the break of dawn

As I look into the crowd tell me what I see
Everybody on the dance floor bout to party
To the early What? morning break of dawn
Like a hot big bag of butter popcorn

As I look into the crowd tell me what I see
Everybody on the dance floor bout to party
To the early What? morning break of dawn
Like a hot big bag of butter popcorn

As I look into the crowd tell me what I see
Everybody on the dance floor bout to party
To the early What? morning break of dawn
