the lyrics

I slept with one eye open
I kept my self control
It made no sense to let it go

One day I found my shadow
Trying to strike the sun
It's always been where I belong
It's out of my hands, it's out of my hands

Now everything is falling into 
Everything is falling into
Everything is falling into place

My lifeboat became my coffin
Filled with things I didn't need
My heart was bursting at the seams
It's out of my hands, it's out of my hands

Chorus

I take this all so seriously
Chasing ghosts around
It keeps me working tirelessly
It lifts me off the ground

Chorus
