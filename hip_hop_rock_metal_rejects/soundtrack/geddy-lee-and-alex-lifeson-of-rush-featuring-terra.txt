Thanks to Julia James for submitting       
the lyrics

O Canada!
Our home and native land!
True patriot love
In all thy sons' command.

With glowing hearts
We see thee rise,

Terrance: "That's right, Geddy!"

The True North
Strong and free!

From far and wide,
O Canada,
We stand on guard
For thee.

God keep our land
Glorious and free!
O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee.

O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee.

*fart*

Hahahahahahahahahahahha!!
