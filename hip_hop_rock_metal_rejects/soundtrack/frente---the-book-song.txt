From The Television Series My So-called Life

I would open up the book
But I don't know where to start to look
You're so tall and you're so strong
Standing by me
But this won't take too long
Do you remember?
I called for you
And you were gone
I thought we were safe but I was wrong
I'm just left here standing
Looking on
You ask me which way I'll go
Whichever way the wind blows
I don't know
There is no eternity at any price
Beggars and choosers don't get to live in paradise
And people die for just one kiss
And it's plain to me
We are not being everything that we could be
No one wants to run the risk
Sometimes I wish I was blind
I thought I saw a whole lot more than this
