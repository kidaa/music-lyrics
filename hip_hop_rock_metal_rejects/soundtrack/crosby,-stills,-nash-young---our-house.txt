I'll light the fire
You put the flowers in the vase
That you bought today 

Staring at the fire
For hours and hours
While I listen to you 
Play your love songs
All night long for me
Only for me 

Come to me now
And rest your head for just five minutes
Everything is good
Such a cosy room
The windows are illuminated
By the sunshine through them 
Fiery gems for you
Only for you 

Our house is a very, very fine house
With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy
'Cause of you
And our la,la,la, la,la, la, la, la, la, la, la..... 

Our house is a very, very fine house

I'll light the fire
And you place the flowers in the jar
