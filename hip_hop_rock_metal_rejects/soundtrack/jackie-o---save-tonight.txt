Save tonight night night night night night 
Save tonight night night night night night 

Save tonight 
Fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Save tonight 
Fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 

Save tonight 

Go and close the curtains 
'Cause all we need is candlelight 
You and me and the bottle of wine 
And I'll hold you tonight 
oh yeah 
Well, we know I'm going away 
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so 
So take this wine and drink with me 
Let's delay our misery 

Save tonight 
Fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Save tonight 
Fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 

There's a log on the fire 
And it burns like me for you 
Tomorrow comes with one desire 
To take me away 
It's True 
It ain't easy to say goodbye 
Darling please don't start to cry 
'Cause boy you know I've got to go 
oh
And Lord I wish it wasn't so 

Save tonight 
Fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Save tonight 
Fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 

Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Save tonight night night night night night 
Tonight night night night night night 
Tonight night night night night night 
Tonight night night night night night 
Tonight night night night night night
