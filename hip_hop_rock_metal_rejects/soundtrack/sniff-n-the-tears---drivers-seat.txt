Doing alright 
A little jiving on a Saturday night 
And come what may 
Gonna dance the day away 

Jenny was sweet 
Show a smile for the people she needs 
I'm trouble, let's drive, 
I don't know the way you came alive 

News is blue the news is blue 
Has its own way to get to you 
What can I do what can I do 
When I remember my time with you 

Pick up your feet 
Got to move to the trick of the beat 
There is no lead 
Just take your place in the driver's seat 

Driver's seat, oohoo, driver's seat, yeah 

Doing alright 
A little jiving on a Saturday night 
And come what may 
Gonna dance the day away 

Driver's seat, oohoo, driver's seat, yeah 

Jenny was sweet 
There is no lead 
Pick up your feet, pick up, pick up 
Pick up your feet, gonna dance the day away 

Driver's seat, oohoo, driver's seat, yeah 
Driver's seat, oohoo, driver's seat, yeah 
Driver's seat...
