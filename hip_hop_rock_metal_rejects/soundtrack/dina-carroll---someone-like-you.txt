thanks to Julie James for submitting 
the lyrics

I've been searching a long time 
For someone exactly like you 
I've been travelling all around the world 
Waiting for you to come through 

chorus 
Someone like you 
Makes it all worthwhile 
Someone like you 
Keeps me satisfied 
Someone exactly like you 

I've been doing some soul searching 
To find out where you're at 
I've been up and down the highway 
In all kinds of foreign lands 

chorus 

I've been all around the world 
Marching to the beat of a different drum 
But just lately I have realised 
The best is yet to come 

chorus
