Lyrics by Norman Grossfeld

How the universe began
What the future holds
Why do fools fall in love
What happens to our souls
Clues to life's mysteries
Are what we hope to find
Always reachin' for a reason
Searchin' for a sign 

To know the unknown
It doesn't mean that much to me
To know the unknown
Some secrets are just meant to be
Don't want all the answers
'Cause one thing is true
As long as my heart beats 
I'll always love you
So I don't need to know
The unknown 

Is there life on other planets
Why there's magic in a kiss
What dreams really mean
Who hears us when we wish
Everybody's wondering
Tryin' to understand
But all the revelations 
Are like castles in the sand 

To know the unknown
It doesn't mean that much to me
To know the unknown
Some secrets are just meant to be
I don't need all the answers
'Cause one thing is true
As long as the earth turns 
I'll always love you 

You don't have to tell me
Just why you went away 
Now that you've come back 
There's nothing more to say
All I really need to know
Is that you're here to stay 

Repeat Chorus twice 

So I don't need to know
The unknown
