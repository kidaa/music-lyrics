STAN:
There's a bunch of birds in the sky
And some deers just went running by
Oh, the snow's pure and white on the earth rich and brown
Just another Sunday morning in my quiet mountain town

The sun is shining and the grass is green
Under the three feet of snow I mean
This is a day when it's hard to wear a frown
All the happy people stop to say hello

Even though the temperatures low
It's a perfect Sunday morning in my quiet little mountain town

DIALOGUE

STAN'S MOM
Oh what a picture perfect child
Just like jesus he's tender and mild
He'd wear a smile while he wore a thorny crown
What an angel wiht a heart so sweet an sure
And a mind so open and pure
Thank god we live in this quiet little redneck mountain town.

STAN
You can see your breath hanging in the air
You see homeless people but you just don't care
