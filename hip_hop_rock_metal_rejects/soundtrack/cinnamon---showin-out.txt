get fresh 
g-g-get fresh fresh fresh fresh fre 
get fresh 
fre-fre-fre fre fre-fre-fre fre 
get fresh on the weekend 
showin' out 
showin' out 
I'm showin' out 
showin' out showin' out 
I'm showin' out 

{crowd noises} 

showin' out showin' out 
I'm showin' out showin' out 
I'm showin' out I'm showin' out 
you'd rather live in love than luxury 
it's allright 
and don't go dining out on foolish dreams 
every night 
it only takes a moment to feel allright 

get fresh on the weekend 
showin' out 
get fresh on the weekend 
showin' out 
showin' out 
showin' out 
I'm showin' out 
showin' out 
I'm showin' out 

cant afford to wear diamonds and pearls 
that's ok 
wouldn't want to be that kind of girl 
anyway yeah yeah yeah 
it only takes a moment to feel allright 

get fresh on the weekend 
showin' out 
get fresh on the weekend 
showin' out 
showin' out 
showin' out 
showin' out showin' out 
showin' out 
I'm showin' out showin' out 
showin' out 
I'm showin' out 
[let's celebrate] 
[nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice] 
[let's celebrate]
