Solitary girl I have been 
Living in a cell made of skin 
Sealed inside myself, nothing gets out or gets in 
I can't feel what you feel 
Show me the way to my heart 
Show me the way 
Show me the way to my heart, baby 
Show me, show me 
I'll give you everything I possess 
If you tell me where you keep your happiness 
I look more and more and I find less and less 
I don't know what you know 
But I make it up as I go, yeah 
Show me the way to my heart 
Show me the way, yeah 
Show me the way to my heart, baby 
Show me, show me 
My fingers search for you while I sleep 
Looking for something to keep 
Help me feel what you feel 
Show me the way to my heart 
Show me the way 
Show me the way to my heart, baby 
Show me, show me 
To my heart... 
To my heart... 
Show me the way to my heart 
Show me the way 
Show me the way to my heart, baby 
Show me, show me 
Show me the way to my heart 
Show me the way, yeah 
Show me the way to my heart, baby 
Show me, show me, show me, yeah 
Show me the way to my heart 
Show me the way 
Show me the way to my heart
