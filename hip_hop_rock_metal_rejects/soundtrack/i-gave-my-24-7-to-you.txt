You said jump, I asked how high 
You made the rules, that we live by 
And now I find, I made a Frankenstein 
I spoiled you rotten, night and day 
I always let you get your way 
I did the crime, now I'm doing time 

Baby, for showing you I care 
I'm tearing out my hair 
Baby, you never do your share 
You know it isn't fair 

Chorus 
I gave my 24-7 to you 
Doing everything you wanted to 
I bought you sushi and yogurt too 
You bought a ringer 
Just to pull me through 
'Cause you know that's it's true 
I gave my 24-7 to you 

Every time that we're alone 
You sit there talkin' on the phone 
It never ends 
Now I hate your friends 
Every time I tell you no 
You're quick to tell me where to go 
I'd leave it all 
If I had your balls 

Baby, I let you wear the pants 
You wore off the romance 
Baby, you never miss a chance 
To tell me I can't dance 

I gave my 24-7 to you 
Doing everything you wanted to 
I bought you Prada and Old Navy too 
You never wear 'em 
Now I'm feeling blue 
Girl, you know that it's true 
I gave my 24-7 to you 

Baby, it's true 
There'll never ever ever 
Ever never be another one like you 

I gave my 24-7 to you 
Doing everything you wanted to 
I bought you Britney and Limp Bizkit too 
You sold them back 
For money that I blew 
Girl, you know that it's true 
I gave my 24-7 to you
