the ENGINEER approaches JOHN

ENGINEER
hey monsieur John, how'd you like to get rich
go home in style. . .?

JOHN
yeah okay, what's the pitch?

ENGINEER
an U.S. visa to help me out
lend me a bit of your embassy clout

JOHN
there isn't a chance pal, you're too well known
look, what I want is that girl in the dress

ENGINEER
you have a good eye
her name is Kim, she's my new princess
you give her a try?

JOHN
it's my friend Chris
who's the one feeling down

MARINE
I ordered a beer!

ENGINEER
she'll get him up,
it's her first night in town
but I have to warn you
she don't come cheap
it's got to be twenty for my princess

JOHN
twenty dollars??

ENGINEER
she's sort of a virgin, well more or less
for twenty more you get a room and key
for fifty bucks, she's got the whole night free

MARINES
no one gives us a buzz 
like the Engineer does

JOHN approaches CHRIS with Kim

JOHN
stop drooling white boy
you're losing your cool
you like this jail bait

CHRIS
John, open your eyes
this is the end of the line
this whole rotten scene

this little girl, we could be in the sack
for what it costs me to buy a big mac
John, it's time to go back -
you know what I mean

JOHN
I'm starting to cry pal
you're so out of touch
the trouble with you is you think too much
ooh
ol' Dr. John knows what you need alright
I've bought you a present
she yours all night

MARINES
no one gives you a hit like the Engineer's shit!!

Across the room, the ENGINEER speaks to KIM.

ENGINEER
see little princess, I was right
you got the biggest score tonight
you caught that sergeant by the nose
you stay with him until he goes
call him Chris
he'll like that

KIM
that marine
wants his beer

ENGINEER
you said you needed a job
you said you'd turn a trick
you'd better prove it, and quick!

he leads KIM to CHRIS

ENGINEER
voila!
