Exanaplanetooch
A planet in another galaxy
Exanaplanetooch
A place where all the people look like me

A planet where the air is pure
The river waters crystal bright
The sky is green
And in the night
Twelve golden moons 
Provide the light

The buildings in the cities
Shaped like hills
Made of black and green
And blue and yellow glass
With rivers running through them
Crystal bright

Swim in the water
Drink from the rivers
Total beauty, total health
Every man's an artist and a scientist-philosopher
No government and no police
No wars, no crime, no hate
Just happiness and love

Fulfillment of each man's potential
And ambition
With ever-widening horizons

Exanaplanetooch
A planet in another galaxy
Exanaplanetooch
Would you like to go back with me
