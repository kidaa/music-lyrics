you've got no selfesteem, and you think you're so mistreated. 
you can't stand your face, and you cannot, 
cannot believe that you cannot control your fate 

chorus
this isn't what you wanted 
someone to break you down every motherfucking day 
it's not the life you wanted 
someone to break you, someone to make you 

bruises on your face, i guess you fell down the steps again 
and that's such a shame, cause you let it, 
you let it happen over and over again 

repeat chorus 

it's just another day, the last day he touches you again. 
but that's the price he'll pay. 
you pull the trigger, it all goes away in one determined flash 

repeat chorus 

b-verse
PAY!! close you eyes, you better, hold em' tight, you'll never, 
don't keep telling yourself it'll be alright, don't keep telling yourself it'll be alright. 

solo
