1
I don't know what is it is that makes me love you so 
I only know I never wanna let you go 
'Cause you started something, can't you see 
That ever since we met you've got a hold on me 
It happens to be true I only wanna be with you 

2
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do 
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you 
Look what has happened with just one kiss 
I never knew that I could be in love like this 
It's crazy but it's true I only wanna be with you 

Chorus
You stopped, you smiled at me 
Asked me if I cared to dance 
I fell into your open arms 
And I didn't stand a change 
Now listen honey 

3
I just wanna be beside you everywhere 
As long as we're together honey, I don't care 
'Cause you started something, can't you see 
That ever since we met you've got a hold on me 
No matter what you do I only wanna be with you 

Chorus

No matter what you do 
I only, I only, I only wanna be with you
