CHRIS and JOHN return

CHRIS
we could not find her anywhere
honey, what's wrong?

ELLEN
Kim was here
the one who had to tell her was me

JOHN
oh, my God, it's my fault

CHRIS
I knew we were gone too long!

ELLEN
no, I think it's exactly what I had to see
you said you lived with her, that's all you were
only one thing you left out is that you loved her

CHRIS
it was just two weeks, that was years ago

JOHN
nothing's changed for her

ELLEN
don't explain
there's nothing you can say
it's like she's gone insane
she tried to give away 
her own child

JOHN
she wants your son to be an American boy

ELLEN
don't you see, she still thinks she's married to you
you must tell her she's not, she must hear it and soon
'course that only depends if it's true

CHRIS
please don't doubt me Ellen: you're my wife
lots of guys came back and had no life
I had you

ELLEN
you can say what you want but she's borne you a son
in your nightmares the name that you shouted was hers
you've been with me two years and not shared things you've done
don't hold back
let me see
is it her now
or me?

CHRIS
let me tell you the way it was
back when I was a different man
back when I didn't have a clue who I am
the feelings locked behind a dam
that kept me there in Vietnam

there in the shambles of a war 
I found what I was looking for
Saigon was crazed, but she was real
and for one moment, I could feel

I saw a world I never knew
and through her eyes I suffered too
in spite of all the things that were
I started to believe in her

so I wanted to save her, protect her
Christ, I'm American, how could I fail to do good?
all I made was a mess, just like everyone else
in a place full of mystery that I never once understood!
I wanted back a world I knew
the story of my life began again
with you

ELLEN CHRIS
it's all right now, that's all through oh Ellen, I should have told you
we'll get past this, start anew will you ever trust me again? 
all I want all I have
in my life in my life now
is you is you

JOHN
now listen guys
it's not so easy
there is this kid
who looks just like you
hey, I think it's great
you have each other
but he exists
you have to face it

I run a camp that is filled with bui-doi
looking for the fathers that they may never find
you don't have a complicated choice with this boy
do you want to take him out or leave him behind?

CHRIS
he's my son
I won't abandon him
except that, Jesus Christ, John
there is also Kim
what of her?

ELLEN
if it was only Tam
I'd take him now
he is your son
we'd make it work somehow
but Chris, she still loves you
how can I have her near?

CHRIS
there's no choice
I think the answer's clear
they'll have to stay in Bangkok
we'll support them here

ELLEN JOHN
I think this is the answer Listen, you didn't see what's in that girl's head

CHRIS AND ELLEN
for now this is the answer I hope you are both proud of what you've just said

ELLEN
it's done

CHRIS
it's done

CHRIS AND ELLEN
it's planned
the girl is smart
she'll understand

KIM
walking around the streets of Bangkok
you must take Tam with you

CHRIS AND ELLEN
in Bangkok, he will go to American schools

KIM
I won't break my promise to my son

CHRIS AND ELLEN
they will start a new life

KIM
you will take Tam with you

CHRIS AND ELLEN
we'll provide for their needs

JOHN
you are talking like fools!

KIM
you won't forget Tam is a part of you

CHRIS, ELLEN, JOHN
we will you should do what is right
right for him
right for us
right for Kim

KIM
I still taste your kisses
your voice sings in my ear
you can betray what we were yesterday
but you'll come back tonight for him

KIM returns to the bar. THE ENGINEER comes out with TAM.

ENGINEER
come on, come on, your recitation
describe your reconciliation
I hope before his stimulation
he bought our little group vacation

KIM
in all his dreams he saw our baby
and he's teaching him to fly
paper dragons in the sky

ENGINEER
yes, papers, what's the situation?
we'll need our cards for immigration
no tricks, I've got my reputation
don't want no phony complications

KIM
no, no
he's coming to us tonight
pack your things
get yourself arranged
while I change for my last performance

ENGINEER
me, Chris and you
what a menage!
Bangkok can screw!
bon voyage!
