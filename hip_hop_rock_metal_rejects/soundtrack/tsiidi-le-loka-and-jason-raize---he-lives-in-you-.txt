Music and Lyrics by Mark Mancina, Jay Rifkin, and Lebo M 

Ingonyama nengw' enamabala 

Night and the spirit of life calling mamela 
And a voice just the fear of a child answers mamela 

Ubu khosi bo khokho		[This is the throne of our ancestors] 

We ndodana ye sizwe sonke	[Oh, son of the nation] 

Wait, there's no mountain too great 
Hear the words and have faith 
Have faith 

He lives in you 
He lives in me 

He watches over 
Everything we see 
Into the water 
Into the truth 
In your reflection 
He lives in you 

He lives in you 
He lives in me 
He watches over 
Everything we see 
Into the water 
Into the truth 
In your reflection 
He lives in you 

He lives in you 
He lives in you 
He lives in you 
He lives in you 

He lives in you 

He lives in me 

He watches over 
Everything we see 
Into the water 
Into the truth 
In your reflection 
He lives in you 

He lives in you 
He lives in me 
He watches over 
Everything we see 
Into the water 
Into the truth 
In your reflection 
He lives in you
