You Hate my face, but now I look you're gonna change me 
A lashing from your tongue and now you're gonna scorn me. 
You Taste my blood, my cut my skin, and now you want me. 
You hate my face, but now I look I think you changed me. 

Balls that pokken are whip lashed 
Easily pokken within one ply 

Release Me 
Release Me 

My Time to fall 
My face lays down the ground where I once walked 
No time to fall 

My massive shield, my beating till, you try and fleck me 
Cry with shame my eyes are scorn and then you dump me 

Easily bitten within one ply 

Release Me 
Release Me 

My Time to fall 
My face lays down the ground where I once walked 
No time to fall 
My faith lays down the ground where I've been lost 

FALL 
I stare at my life again 
I'm 
I'm scared of my life again 
Scared of my life again 
I 
I stare at my life again 
Stare at my life again 
I'm 
I'm scared of my life again 

My Time to fall 
My face lays down the ground that I once walked 
My time to fall 
My faith lays down the ground where I've been lost 
My Time to fall 
My Fame lays down 
No Time at all 

FALL 
I stare at my life again 
I'm 
I'm scared of my life again 
Scared of my life again 
I I I'm 
I'm scared of my life again 
Scared of my life again 
I'm 
I'm scared of my life again 
Scared of my life again 
I I I 
I stare at my life again 
Stare at my life again
