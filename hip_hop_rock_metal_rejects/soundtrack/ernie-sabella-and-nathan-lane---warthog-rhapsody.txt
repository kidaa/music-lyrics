Music by Elton John, lyrics by Tim Rice 

Now if you want a role model 
Of a life most blissfully led 
Then look no further than Pumbaa here 
Then this laid-back quadruped 
	Relaxation's the name of the game 
	Be cool and be thick-skinned 
	Let my lifestyle be your reference frame 
As long as you stand upwind 
Your guide must be this rhapsody 

Chorus
I gets up when I likes 
	He's got it all worked out 
I plans the day ahead 
	He's got it all worked out 
When inspiration strikes 
	He's got it all worked out 
I go right back to bed 
	He's got it all worked out 

But though he may not be one of nature's dynamos 
His mind is on the ball and far from comatose 
Don't dismiss the warthog philosophy

Take it from he! 
He's got it all worked out 
	Take it from me! 
He's got it all worked out 

Now who wants to be a hunter 
Chasing food all over the place 
	More often than not it gets away 
Who needs the thrill of the chase? 
	Why move mountains to get your chow 
	When you only need to move a log 
Make it your dietary resolve for now 
To eat like the old warthog 
Regarding food 
	Hmmmmmmmmm
His attitude 

Chorus
It's bugs for every meal 
	I've got it all worked out 
So full of vitamins 
	I've got it all worked out 
No need to cook or peel 
	I've got it all worked out 
He eats 'em in their skins 
	I've got it all worked out 

The're delectable, available, the perfect snack 
They ain't endangered species 
And they don't fight back 
Don't dismiss the warthog gastronomy 

Take it from he 
	Take it from me 
Take it from he 
He's got it all worked out 

So remember when you see us staring into space 
We're caught between a pillow and a soft, soft place 
Don't resist the warthog mentality 
Take it from he 
	Take it from me 
Take it from he 
	Take it from we 
We've got it all worked out
