There's a room where I can go and tell my secrets to
In my room, in my room 

In this world I lock out all my worries and my cares
In my room, in my room 

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray 

Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday 

Now it's dark and I'm alone and I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
Repeat till fade
