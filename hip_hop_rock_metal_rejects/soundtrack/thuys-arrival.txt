the door opens. A stranger enters.

THUY
you're here, at last
I've come to take you home
all night, I ran
I made it through the line
Kim, tell your friends, it's time to go away
this life, it ends
you're safe with me

CHRIS
this girl is mine!

THUY
yours?

CHRIS
now

THUY
you?

TOGETHER
who are you?

KIM
stop!

THUY
who is this man? this American man?
do none of you see what's ahead
have you gone mad?
these are losers and whores
who will soon all be gone or be dead

CHRIS
get out of here

KIM
you have no right to be here
I'm not a prize you can claim
we were promised at thirteen
the woman I am now is not the same

THUY
our parents bound us together, and that is our fate
you knew I'd come back to get you
why didn't you wait?

KIM
my parents got themselves killed in the week you changed sides
if there were promises all of them died when they died

CHRIS and THUY pull guns. The girl scream.

GIGI and the GIRLS leave quickly

THUY
Kim, leave this man behind

KIM
go on! 
and shoot!
I will not change my mind!

THUY
you are still mine!

KIM
not anymore!

THUY
you're mine until we die!

THUY
Saigon 
is doomed
and so is your GI

CHRIS
get the hell out!

THUY
you broke your father's word
this is your curse!

THUY runs out. CHRIS runs out after him but he's gone.

CHRIS
what a party that was!

KIM
you're going to leave me now

CHRIS
yes, I'm going to leave
and take you out with me
