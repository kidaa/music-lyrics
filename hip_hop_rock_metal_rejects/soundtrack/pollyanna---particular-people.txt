I come with a warning
What you get is what you see
At four in the morning the man that you love will fess up and leave
The noise of the car will sound so familiar

Particular people had their say
They're serving you up on silver trays

Covered in pillows
They smother the noise of pistol mouths
A corporate widow
You wait for the day your inmate's out
The calls and the cards will blur in an instant

Couldn't believe that you'd end up this way
Befriending a needle to ease the pain
Particular people let you go
Covered in bruises from head to toe

I'm done with my warnings
Cover me up just let me die
