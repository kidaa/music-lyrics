I needed somethin', somethin' out there
I didn't know what I was missin'!
Everyone talkin' 'bout it everywhere
I guess I just wasn't listenin' 

Yahoo, things are comin' together
Yahoo, yeah it's turning out nice
Yahoo, it's so much better
Yahoo, I got a whole new life 

Chorus:
It's everything I wanted
Everything I needed
It's everything I dreamed about
It's here in my heart
It's deep in my soul
And nothin's gonna take it out
Never felt so good
Never felt so right
Never knew that it would be
The biggest part of my life 

There's only one thing fuelin' the fire
From now until ever after
My only passion, my desire
Is to be a Pokmon Master
Yahoo, things are comin' together
Yahoo, yeah it's turning out nice
Yahoo, it's so much better
Yahoo, I got a whole new life 

Repeat Chorus 

Everyday the world looks better
That's the way its meant to be
Everybody being all together
It's feelin' really good to me
