Written and performed by Lebo M. 

I was born in times of misery and pain 
Throughout my life, I've never known happiness 
Melody, my true love and company 
In her song, she helps me carry on 

I'm singing my song 
I sing it for the children 
This is a song 
For the children of the world 

In a song of peace and happiness is said 
The harmony a sweet melody 
In a song of peace and happiness is said 
The harmony a sweet melody 

This is a song 
For all the world's children 
Without conscious minds 
And a positive meaning 
They are the light 
For all of God's people 
Deep in their hearts 
Is the hope of the future 

This is a song 
For all the children 
This is a song 
For all the children 

This is a song
