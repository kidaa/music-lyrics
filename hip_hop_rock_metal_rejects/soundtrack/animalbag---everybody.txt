Well, I've been living in the city
Where the day's light is shitty
And the nights can be so long
So now I gotta break away
From the same old everyday
I'm heading back where I belong

It's what I gotta do
You gotta tell 'em all to stick it where the sun don't shine 

Everybody gotta move out to the country
Everybody gotta get out of the city

Well now I'm living in the city
Where the scenery isn't pretty
As the grass and trees can be
So now I gotta use my mind
Where the sun'd always shine
To go see what I can see

It's what I gotta do
Gotta tell 'em all to stick it where the sun don't shine 

Everybody gotta move out to the country
Everybody gotta get out of the city
It ain't no surprise when you're under blue skies
You don't got no worries, pain, and no hurry
Everybody gotta move out to the country

Goodbye city life!

We are there...

Right there, see that sun?
I can breath the air
I can wear no clothes
I can grow my hair
I got ample room and there's plenty to spare 'cause...

Everybody gotta move out to the country
Everybody gotta get out of the city
Everybody gotta move out to the country
Everybody gotta get out of the city

It ain't no surprise
When you're under blue skies

Don't got no worries, pain, and no hurry
Everybody's gotta move out to the country

Pack your bags!
