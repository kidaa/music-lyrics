Why are you talking to me?
I think I've taken too much
Tell me who told you 
What you think you know
If I am changing
Maybe I'm growing into a version
Of the sewer Christ picture show

Maybe it's stupid 
Maybe it's nothing 
Maybe this something 
Just won't go away

I'm not a liar 
And I'm not a martyr 
I'm just trying
Not to get thrown away

How does it feel?
I feel so alone
How does it feel?
I feel so cold 

Maybe it's stupid 
Maybe it's nothing 
Maybe this something 
Just won't go away

How does it feel?
I feel so alone

How does it feel to be part of your world?
How does it feel to be part of this world?

How does it feel?
I feel so alone
How does it feel?
I feel so cold

How does it feel?
I feel so alone
How does it feel?
I feel so cold

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

Relax and hunger for hesitation
Remember the times that cut so deep 
The bridge is burning in shallow water
The bride is taking too much sleep

Unwind sunshine and meet your maker 
Define the line of blood and truth 
Unwind sunshine and make your martyr
This time life depends on you

Madtrain return of depression 
He's an icy lonely strung out creep
His days are turning into nightmares 
The dark horse eats god
Lonely sheep

Unwind sunshine and meet your maker 
Define the line of blood and truth 
Unwind sunshine and make your martyr
This time life depends on you

I know it, I see it
It's right in front of my face, my face
I know it, I see it
It's right in front of my face, my face 
I know it, I see it
It's right in front of my face, my face
I know it, I see it
It's right in front of my face

Unwind sunshine and meet your maker 
Define the line of blood and truth 
Unwind sunshine and make your martyr
This time life depends on you

On you

On you 

On you
