And I am telling you I'm not going. 
You're the best man I'll ever know. 
There's no way I can ever go 
No, no, no, no way 
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you. 
I'm not livin' without you. 
I don't want to be free. 
I'm stayin', I'm stayin' 
And you, and you, you're gonna love me. 
Ooh, you're gonna love me. 
And I am telling you I'm not going 
Even though the rough times are showing. 
There's just no way 
There's no way. 
We're part of the same place. 
We're part of the same time. 
We both share the same blood. 
We both have the same mind. 
And time and time we have so much to share 
No, no, no, No, no, no, 
I'm not wakin' up tomorrow mornin' 
And findin' that there's nobody there. 
Darling, there's no way 
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you. 
I'm not livin' without you. 
You see, there's just no way 
There's no way. 
Tear down the mountains 
Yell, scream and shout. 
You can say what you want 
I'm not walkin' out. 
Stop all the rivers 
Push, strike, and kill. 
I'm not gonna leave you 
There's no way I will. 
And I am telling you I'm not going. 
You're the best man I'll ever know. 
There's no way I can ever, ever go 
No, no, no, no way 
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you. 
Oh, I'm not livin' without you 
I'm not livin' without you. 
I don't wanna be free. 
I'm stayin', I'm stayin' 
And you, and you 
You're gonna love me. 
Oh, hey, you're gonna love me 
Yes, ah, ooh, ooh, love me 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, love me 
Love me, Love me, Love me, Love me. 
You're gonna love me.
