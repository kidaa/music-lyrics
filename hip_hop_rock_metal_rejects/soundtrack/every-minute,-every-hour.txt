Another day has gone by
Still have you picture, by my side
I can't forget when you left
When we said goodbye
I know it's hard to carry on,
Can I survive?

Every mintue, every hour
I just can't get you out of my mind
No matter how hard I try
Every day, every night
I wish you were back in my life
Can we give it just one more chance,
This time

Looking back on it now
Oooo
Where we went wrong
I can't figure out
Wish I could turn back the time
And make you mine
Is it too late
For us to try
A second time

Every mintue, every hour
I just can't get you out of my mind
No matter how hard I try
Every day, every night
I wish you were back in my life
Can we give it just one more chance,
This time

I just don't see things the same
I can't get out of the way
It's clouding my mind
It's clouding my mind
I'll make it all up to you
Just tell me what I should do
I want you back in my life

Gimme one more chance

Every mintue, every hour
I just can't get you out of my mind
No matter how hard I try
Every day, every night
I wish you were back in my life
Can we give it just one more chance,

Every mintue, every hour
I just can't get you out of my mind
No matter how hard I try
Every day, every night
I wish you were back in my life
Can we give it one more chance,
This time

Can we give it just one more chance
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
