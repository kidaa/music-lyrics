You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
But you must try, try and try 
Try and try, you'll succeed at last 

Persecution you must bear 
Win or lose you've got to get your share 
Got your mind set on a dream 
You can get it, though harder them seem now 

You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
But you must try, try and try 
Try and try, you'll succeed at last 
I know it, listen 

Rome was not built in a day 
Opposition will come your way 
But the hotter the battle you see 
It\'s the sweeter the victory, now 

You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
But you must try, try and try 
Try and try, you'll succeed at last 

You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
You can get it if you really want 
But you must try, try and try 
Try and try, you'll succeed at last 

You can get it if you really want - I know it 
You can get it if you really want - though I show it 
You can get it if you really want 
- so don't give up now
