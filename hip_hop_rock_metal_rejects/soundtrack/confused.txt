BLACKstreet

Kick it, uh, uh, uh, uh 

I wanna be all alone 
I guess I gotta be alone 
But why I gotta be alone 
Yeah, I'll so confused 

I wanna be all alone 
I guess I gotta be alone 
But why I gotta be alone 
BLACKstreet let me heart ya sing 

1 - Just wanna be alone please 
Don't need nobody to control me 
I'll tired of all the pressure on me 
But what am I gonna do 
I'll so confused 
Can't let you go, no 
Sometimes I just don't know 
But I gotta let it all show 
I guess I gotta be all alone 

Sometimes I'll confused about this thing I have for you 
It makes me a little bit crazy, puttin' me in this mood 
I want to be on my own but then I want you home 
You make me feel good but I'd rather be all alone 

Repeat 1 

I know it's wrong for me to say it and think this way 
But I don't wanna see you with nobody else but me 
So what am I supposed to do when I'll so ashamed 
To say I wanna be alone just like I was yesterday 

Oh, you need to take it all for real and not for fun 
Even though I'll getting tired of these indecisions 
'Cause I don't really know which one to choose 
One day I want you here, next don't bother 
I'll so confused 

Repeat 1 

I'll confused, that's not the way I choose to 
I want you and I feel you, it's takin' control of me 
I'll not the same, no one to blame 
I can't explain, cuz I'll so confused 

I wanna be all alone 
I guess I gotta be alone 
But why I gotta be alone 
Yeah, I'll so confused 

I wanna be all alone 
I guess I gotta be alone 
But why I gotta be alone 
Uh, uh, uh 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 

I get so confused
