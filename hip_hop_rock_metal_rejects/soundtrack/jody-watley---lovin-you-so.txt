You got the lovin' baby, my style
You got the groove, the kind I like
And in my heart there's love for you
It's deeper than any ocean blue

Oh baby, love's so right
Truly above the sky, whoa

Taking the feelings baby I feel
Used to ride around and chill
Baby, in the stars is a place we find
To find the special paradise

Love's in bloom
Because you feel this too, whoa

Baby your love's a blessing
Sent from heaven down for me to have it
And when all the dark clouds come out
Just call on you because you baby are so loved

I'm loving you so
I'm loving you so
I'm loving you so
I'm loving you so

Baby love's like I'm flight
With your love the sky high

Repeat 1 til the end of song
