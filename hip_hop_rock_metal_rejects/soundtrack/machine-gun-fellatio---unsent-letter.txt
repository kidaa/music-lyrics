I try to talk to you 
Can't get past the weather 
The friend I thought I knew 
Has found somethin', somewhere better 
So I'm hanging on your line 
Thought we could speak together 
Tell me what it is with you, you seem gone forever 

I'm spendin' all my time driven round thinkin' clever 
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better 
I don't know if I lied when I said we're not together 
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone 

I know what could've been. Try not to think about it 
Found it hard to live wi' this, and long to live without it 
But my dreams have caught me out, I found my self surrounded 
By the odds of our own end enough said about it 

I'm spendin' all my time driven round thinkin' clever 
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better 
I don't know if I lied when I said we're not together 
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone 

I've given up some thing, I guess that doesn't matter 
I've started other things, I guess that doesn't matter 
But I finally wrote your song, another unsent letter 
In a pile addressed to you, c-/ of somethin', somewhere better 

I'm spendinall my time driven round thinkinclever 
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better 
I don't know if I lied when I said we're not together 
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone 

I'm spendinall my time driving round fakin' clever 
With a girl who seems all right and another one who's better 
I don't know if I lied when I said that I'm together 
But I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone forever 
Yeah, but I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone forever 
Yeah, but I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone forever 
Yeah, but I try to talk to you, some how you seem gone
