the lyrics

Ratcliffe: 
What can you expect
From filthy little heathens?
Their whole disgusting race is like a curse
Their skin's a hellish red
They're only good when dead
They're vermin, as I said
And worse

English Settlers: 
They're savages! Savages!

Ratcliffe: 
Barely even human

English Settlers: 
Savages! Savages!

Ratcliffe: 
Drive them from our shore!
They're not like you and me
Which means they must be evil
We must sound the drums of war!

English Settlers: 
They're savages! Savages!
Dirty redskin devils!
Now we sound the drums of war!

Powhatan: 
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon
The only thing they feel at all is greed

Kekata: 
Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside

Native Americans: 
I wonder if they even bleed

They're savages! Savages!
Barely even human
Savages! Savages!

Powhatan: 
Killers at the core

Kekata: 
They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted

Powhatan: 
We must sound the drums of war

Native Americans: 
They're savages! Savages!
First we deal with this one

All: 
Then we sound the drums of war

English Settlers: 
Savages! Savages!

Ben: 
Let's go kill a few, men!

Native Americans: 
Savages! Savages!

Ratcliffe: 
Now it's up to you, men!

All: 
Savages! Savages!
Barely even human!
Now we sound the drums of war!
