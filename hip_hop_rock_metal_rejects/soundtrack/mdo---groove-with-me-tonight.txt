You came to me without a warning  
without a doubt you were the one for me  
cause I could feel the fire burning  
I knew I couldn't live  
another night  
and never knowing  
if I could be  
your every fantasy  
I must confess  
now that you're near me  
I want to set this passion free  

This feeling controls me, it drives me crazy  
just let me, take over, don't fear it baby  
the moment, is burning, you must surrender  
it's now or never girl  

Chorus:  
Groove with me tonight, make it right  
all I'm asking is a little more  
just one touch of your body  
groove with me tonight, it feels right  
don't deny it  
you know you must surrender, girl  
it's now or never  

You must surrender  

You're next to me, the heat is flowing  
and I can see you want this more than me  
just come to me  
my love is waiting, I wanna set this passion free  

This feeling controls me, it drives me crazy  
just let me, take over, don't fear it baby  
the moment, is burning, you must surrender  
it's now or never girl  

Chorus  

My love is waiting, girl  
it's now or never  

This feeling controls me, it drives me crazy  
just let me, take over let me take over, don't fear it baby  
don't fear it baby  
the moment, is burning, you must surrender  
it's now or never girl  

Chorus  

Right, make it right  
all I'm asking is a little more  
just one touch of your body  
just one touch  
groove with me tonight, groove with me tonight  
it feels right  
don't deny it  
you know you must surrender, girl  
it's now or never  

Right, make it right  
groove with me tonight...
