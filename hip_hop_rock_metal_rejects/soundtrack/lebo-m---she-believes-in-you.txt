She'll be there 
To guide and protect you 
She will be there 
To see it through 

She'll lift you up 
When you stumble and fall 
She'll always be there 
To heed to your call 

You've got to realize 
How she'd sacrifice 
Nine months of her life 
To mother your child 

Remember

She loves you 
She really loves you 
She believes in you 
She truly loves you 

In matrimony 
You took her from her home 
Said she'd never be lonely 
In your happy home 

Treat her like a queen 
She'll make you her king 
She'll never desert you 
If you truly love her 

She loves you 
She really loves you 
She believes in you 
She truly loves you 

When times are hard 
You can find a way 
He'll never forsake you 
He'll show you the way 
He'll give you love 

She loves you 
She really loves you 
She believes in you 
She truly loves you 

When times are hard 
You can find a way 
He'll never forsake you 
He'll show you the way 
He'll give you love 

She believes in you 
She truly loves you
