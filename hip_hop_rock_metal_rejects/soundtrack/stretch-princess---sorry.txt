Written By Jo Lloyd, David Magee, James Wright 

you can say you're sorry 
still you know that it won't change a thing 
while I'm here, I'll love you still bigger 
but it's too late for me 
girls like you, I'd like to, but I guess I don't 
Oh, I owe it to me 
Lets spend the weekend on our own, 
trying to get it right. 
When you're high, I'm down on you 
When you're gone, I'm around for you 
What you need, I've heard it all before, 
and true, it's the same thing 
You can say forever, still you know that it won't mean a thing 
I guess I tried to love you, still it's better when 
something's stay the same 
girls like you, I'd like to, but I guess I don't 
Oh I owe it to me 
Lets spend the weekend on our own 
trying to get it right 
When you're high, I'm down on you 
When you're gone, I'm around for you 
What you need, I've heard it all before 
and true, it's the same thing, 
there's just a better view 
Let's spend the weekend on our own 
just spend the weekend on our own 
trying to get it right 
When you're high, I'm down on you 
When you're gone, I'm around for you 
What you need, I've heard it all before 
and true, it's the same thing 
theres just a better view 
it's just the same thing, 
theres just a better view...
