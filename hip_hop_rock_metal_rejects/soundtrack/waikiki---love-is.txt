Love is lost 
In a tale tossed 
Swept aside 
By fear and pride
Turned away 
By yesterday 
But one thing's right
They never hide 

So if you're feeling that it's just too much 
Then take a breath and hold on tight 
Because love is light

If it's right
If it's right
If it's right

The feeling saughed sp?
They wanted more 
The time is right 
They both felt inside 
They didn't know 
Just where to go 
But one thing's right
They never hide 

So if you're feeling that it's just too much 
Then take a breath and hold on tight 
Because love is light 

If it's right 
If it's right
If it's right 

If you don't learn this time 
I'm going to
Teach you how, I know you could
Be until you understood 
It takes time for love to settle down 
And I know it will this time 
But not for now so close your eyes 

So if you're feeling that it's just too much 
Then take a breath and hold on tight 
Because love is light

If it's right
If it's right 
If it's right
