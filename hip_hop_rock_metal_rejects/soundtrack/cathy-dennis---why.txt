Why'd you want to do that to me
You treat me like a fool
Why, yes, you do, I want to know why
Why, I want to know why

Baby, baby, baby, I can't tell what's on your mind
You avoid the situation, just trying to be kind
If you want to tell me something then, baby, let me know
'cause the truth is often kinder than the lies that follow, follow, follow

First you say you want me, then it's oh, no
then you say you need me, shame you don't show
First you say you want me, then it's oh, no
then you say you need me, shame you don't show, show

Why, if you love me, are you treating me this way
I want to know why
I want to know why, if you love me, do you say the things you say
I want to know why

Baby, baby, baby, is there something I should know
I detect a changing of season, your loving touch is cold
If you want to tell me something then say it to me now
'cause the truth is often kinder than the pain of doubt

First you say you want me, then it's oh, no
then you say you need me, shame you don't show
First you say you want me, then it's oh, no
then you say you need me, shame you don't show, show

Why, if you love me, are you treating me this way
I want to know why
I want to know why, if you love me, do you say the things you say
I want to know why

Why, if you love me, are you treating me this way
I want to know why
I want to know why, if you love me, do you say the things you say
I want to know why

Yes, I want to know why, baby
After all that we've been through
Tell me, tell me why
I want to know why, why
Why, tell me why, tell me
I want to know why, tell me why, tell me, tell me

Why, do you need me
Why, do you want me
I want to know why
Do you keep me not to tell me, why, that you love me

Why, do you need me
Why, do you want me
I want to know why
Do you keep me not to tell me, why, that you love me

Why, do you need me
Why, do you want me
I want to know why
Do you keep me not to tell me, why, that you love me

Why, do you need me
Why, do you want me
I want to know why
Do you keep me not to tell me, why, that you love me

Why, why, yeah
I want to know why, why, why, why, yeah
I want to know why, tell me, why, tell me

Why, why, why'd you treat me like a fool
I want to know why, why
Why, Tell me, why, tell me
I want to know why, why, baby, let me say it to you
