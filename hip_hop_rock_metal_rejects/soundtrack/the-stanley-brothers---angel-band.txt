Lyrics: J Hascall and W Bradbury  
Music: J Hascall and W Bradbury  

The latest sun is sinking fast, my race is nearly run 
My strongest trials now are past, my triumph is begun  
O come Angel Band, come   around me stand  
O bear me away on your snowy wings to my immortal home  
O bear me away on your snowy wings to my immortal home  
I know I'm near the holy ranks of friends   kindred dear  
I've brushed the dew on Jordan's banks, the crossing must be near  
I've almost gained my Heavenly home, my spirit loudly sings  
The Holy ones, behold they come, I hear the noise of wings  
O bear my longing heart to Him who bled   died for me  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin   gives me victory
