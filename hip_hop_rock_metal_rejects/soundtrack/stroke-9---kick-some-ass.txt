How many people wanna kick some ass? 

I used to be a nerd 
Grew up in the suburbs 
Nothing there ever went wrong 
I made it up in this song 

I talk about the hood 
I say stuff like it's all good 
Tell people I'm down with all the cool kids downtown 
When I've never even been there 

How many people wanna kick some ass? 
I do I do 
And how many people sick of holding it back? 
I am 
Well I am too 

So don't lay another finger on her 
She's mine and I still want her 
If you put your hands upon her 
You're a goner goner 

And how many people sick of holding it back? 
I am I am 
And how many people wanna kick some ass? 
I would if I could 

But I'm really just a sensitive artist 
Perpatrating like I am the hardest 

So spin your cap around to the back 
You think you rhyme but you can't rap 
Loosen that strap a little more 
Till your axe hits the floor 

Flip off your fans 
Make em cheer 
Try to look sincere 
Anger today's fashion 
So sing another song about bashing someone's head in 

How many people wanna kick some ass? 
I do I do 
And how many people sick of holding it back? 
I am 
Well I am too 

So don't lay another finger on her 
She's mine and I still want her 
If you put your hands upon her 
You're a goner goner 

And how many people sick of holding it back? 
I am I am 
And how many people wanna kick some ass? 
I would if I could 

But I'm really just a sensitive artist 
Perpatrating like I am the hardest 
Acting like I'm not the smartest 
I'm really just a sensitive artist 

Awwwww Yeahhhh 

So don't lay another finger on her 
She's mine and I still want her 
If you put your hands upon her 
You're a goner goner 

And how many people sick of holding it back? 
I am I am 
And how many people wanna kick some ass? 

I said how many people wanna kick some ass? 
How many people wanna kick some ass? 
Whatcha gonna do when your sick of holding it back? 
I think I kick some ass 
How many people wanna kick some ass? 
I would if I could 

But I'm really just a sensitive artist 
Perpatrating like I am the hardest 
Acting like I'm not the smartest 
I'm really just a sensitive artist 
Honest
