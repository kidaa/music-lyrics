Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee, lousy with virginity 
Won't go to bed till I'm legally wed, I can't, I'm Sandra Dee 
Watch it, hey, I'm Doris Day, I was not brought up that way 
Won't come across, even Rock 
Hudson lost his heart to Doris Day 
I don't drink or swear, I won't white my hair, 
I get ill from one cigarette 
Keep your filthy paws off my silky drawers. 
Would you pull that crap with Annette? 
As for you, Troy Donahue, I know what you wanna do 
You got your crust, I'm no object of lust,
I'm just plain Sandra Dee Elvis, 
Elvis, let me be, keep that pelvis far from me
Just keep your cool, now you're starting to drool
Hey, fungu, I'm Sandra Dee
