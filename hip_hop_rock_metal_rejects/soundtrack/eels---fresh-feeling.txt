the lyrics

You don't have a clue,
what it is like
to be next to you.

I'm here to tell you,
that it is good,
that it is true.

Chorus:
Birds singing a song,
old pain is peeling,
this is that fresh
that fresh feeling.
Words can't be that strong,
my heart is real,
this is that fresh,
that fresh feeling.

Try, try to forget,
what's in the past,
tomorrow is here.

Love, orange sky above,
lighting your way
there's nothing to fear.

Chorus

Some people are good,
babe in the hood,
so pure and so free.

I make a safe bet,
you're gonna get,
whatever you need.

Chorus

That fresh feeling.
This is that fresh feeling
