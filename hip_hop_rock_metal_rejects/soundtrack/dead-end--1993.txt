Dead end
Don't walk
Keep out
Red light
Steep cliff
Beware
Mad dog
Blind man
Warning land mine
High voltage line
Don't make a pass
Keep of the grass
Detour
Wet paint
Hands off
Dead end
Men working
Dead end
No standing
Dead end
No parking
Dead end
No smoking
Dead end
No joking
Dead end

No more suffering
No more pain
We gotta get on board that freedom train
Give up that prejudice, hate
It's a heartbreakin' load
And all that violence and greed is stuff we don't need
Oh it's gotta be the end of that old mean road
It's a dead dead dead dead end
