Let's get to know each other better 
In a special way 
I think about you, baby 
Each night and day 
But you're always hanging out 
With the girl next door 
You do each other's makeup 
And so much more 

Friday slumber parties 
When your parents are gone 
I think about you girls 
How we can get it on 

Chorus 
U   U   Me 
Together we make three 
In perfect harmony 
Just U   U   Me 
U   U   Me 
Together we make three 
A perfect fantasy 
Just U   U   Me 

U   U   Me 
Together we make three 

When I think about you girls 
It makes me feel so fine 
And when I call you on the phone 
I need the party line 
Playing Spin the Bottle 
Kisses sweet as wine 
I must've won the lotto 
To hit you and you and I 

Chorus 2x 

Listen girl 
When you kiss me 
On my mouth 
And down my neck 
All at the same time 
When you both whisper different things 
Into different ears 
I can't try to pretend Girlfriends 

U   U   Me 
Together we make three, whoa 
U   U   Me 
Together we make three, whoa 

Chorus 2x 

U   U   Me 
Together we make three 
U   U   Me 
Together we make three 
U   U   Me
