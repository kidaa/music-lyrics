Saturday in the park, 
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park,
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing, 
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs
Can you dig it yes, I can 
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

Saturday in the park
You'd think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
You'd think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar
Singing for us all
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it yes, I can
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost, oh no, no,

Funny days in the park, 
Every day's the Fourth of July
Funny days in the park, 
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, people touching, 
A real celebration
Waiting for us all, 
If we want it, really want it
Can you dig it yes, I can, 
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day
