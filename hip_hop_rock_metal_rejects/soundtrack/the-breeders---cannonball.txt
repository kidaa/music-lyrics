Spitting in a wishing well 
Blown to hell... crash 
I'm the last splash 
I know you, little libertine 
I know you're a real koo koo 

Hey now, hey now, ... 
Want you, Koo Koo, Cannonball [2x] 
In the shade [4x] 

I know you, little libertine 
I know you're a cannonball 
I'll be you're whatever you want 
The bong in this Reggae Song 

Hey now, hey now, ... 
Want you, Koo Koo, Cannonball [2x] 
In the shade [4x] 

Spitting in a wishing well 
Blown to hell... crash 
I'm the last splash 
I'll be you're whatever you want 
The bong in this Reggae Song 

Hey now, hey now, ... 
Want you, Koo Koo, Cannonball [2x] 
In the shade [4x]
