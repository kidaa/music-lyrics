I am so high, I can hear heaven 
I am so high, I can hear heaven 
Oh, but heaven, no heaven, don't hear me 

And they say that a hero can save us 
I'm not gonna stand here and wait 
I hold onto the wings of the eagles 
Watch as we all fly away 

Someone told me, love will not save us 
But how can that be? 
Look what love gave us 
A world full of killing 
And blood spilling 
That world never came 

And they say that a hero can save us 
I'm not gonna stand here and wait 
I hold onto the wings of the eagles 
Watch as we all fly away 

Now that the world isn't ending 
It's love that I'm sending to you 
It isn't the love of a hero 
And that's why I fear it won't do 

And they say that a hero can save us 
I'm not gonna stand here and wait 
I hold onto the wings of the eagles 
Watch as we all fly away 
And they're watching us 
They're watching us 
As we all fly away 
And they're watching us 
They're watching us 
As we all fly away 
They're watching us 
They're watching us 
As we all fly away
