the lyrics

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

It's not the things you do
That tease and wound me bad
But it's the way you do
The things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
{Repeat}
