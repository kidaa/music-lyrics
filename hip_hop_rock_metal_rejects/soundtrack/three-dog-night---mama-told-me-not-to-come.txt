Want some whiskey in your water 
Sugar in your tea 
What's all these crazy questions they askin' me 
This is the craziest party there could ever be 
Don't turn on the lights, 'cause I don't want to see 

Mama told me not to come 
Mama told me not to come 
That ain't the way to have fun, no 

Open up the window 
Let some air into this room 
I think I'm almost chokin' 
From the smell of stale perfume 

And that cigarette you're smoking 
'Bout scared me half to death 
Open up the window, sucker 
Let me catch my breath 

{Refrain} 
Mama told me not to come 
Mama told me not to come 
She said, that ain't the way to have fun, son 
That ain't the way to have fun, son 

The radio is blastin' 
Someone's knocking at the door 
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend 
She's passed out on the floor 

I seen so many things 
I ain't never seen before 
Don't know what it is 
I don't wanna see no more 

{Refrain} 

Mama told me, mama told me, mama told me 
Told me, told me 
That ain't no way to have fun, whoah, yeah yeah 
Mama told me not to come 
Mama, mama, mama told me 
That ain't no way to have fun 

That ain't the way to have fun, no 
That ain't the way to have fun, son 
That ain't the way to have fun, no 
That ain't the way to have fun, son 

{Ad lib, repeat to fade}
