It's a very ancient saying,
But a true and honest thought,
That if you become a teacher,
By your pupils you'll be taught.
As a teacher I've been learning
You'll forgive me if I boast
And I've now become an expert,
On the subject I like most...

[Spoken]
Getting to know you!

[Children Giggle]

[Sung]
Getting to know you, getting to know all about you.
Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me.
Getting to know you, putting it my way,
But nicely,
You are precisely,
My cup of tea.
[Children Giggle]
Getting to know you,
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you,
Getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the beautiful and new
Things I'm learning about you
Day
by
day.

All [Except Children]
Getting to know you,
Getting to know all about you.
Getting to like you,
Getting to hope you like me.
Getting to know you, 
Putting it my way, but nicely,
You are precisely,

Anna
My cup of tea.

All[including children]
Getting to know you,

Day

Children
Getting to know you,
Getting to feel free and easy
