SATAN

*sigh*

Sometimes I think
When I look up real high
That there's such a big world up there
I'd like to give it a try

But then I sink
Cuz it's here I'm s'posed to stay
But I get so lonely down here
Tell me why's it have to be that way?


Up there there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom
Everyone dreams, I can dream too
Up there
Up where the skies are ocean blue
I could be safe and live without a care up there

They say I don't belong
I must stay below alone
Because of my beliefs 
I'm supposed stay where evil sown

But what is evil anyway?
Is there reason to the rhyme?
Without evil there could be no good
So it must be good to be evil sometimes

Up there there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom
Everyone dreams, I can dream too
Up there
Up where the skies are ocean blue
I could be safe and live without a care 
Live without a care
If only i could live up there!

I want to live up there
