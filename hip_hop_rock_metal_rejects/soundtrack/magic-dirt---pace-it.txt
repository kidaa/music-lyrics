Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me
Can't see it, Can't feed it
Can't steal it, Can't keep it
Oh can you feel it
Something comin' closer to you're body
Oh can you see it
Someone's taken over from where you started
Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me
Can't freeze it, Can't need it
Can't keep it, Can't deal with it
Oh can you feel it
Something comin' closer to you're body
Oh can you see it
Someone's taken over from where you started
Can't everything be like before
When it overcomes me
Can't see it
Can't feel it
Can't steal it
Can't keep it
Can't need it
Can't believe it
Can't trace it
Can't face it
Can't lace it
Can't taste it
Can't pace it
Can't erase it
