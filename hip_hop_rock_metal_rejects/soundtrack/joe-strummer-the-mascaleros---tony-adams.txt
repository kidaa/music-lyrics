the lyrics

Tonight there was a power cut in the city of madness 
All conversations died in the burst of a solar flare 
In the darkness an angel won the beauty pagent 
And stroboscopic snowflakes fell from the stratosphere
And all the neon blew down funky Broadway 
And shorted out the eastern shore 
Only saxophones and beach trombones 
Were left to shout out 'we all need a little more!

And I'm waiting for the rays of the morning sun 
Somebody tell me clearly has the new world begun?
Let all the wailing wail, let the drummer drum 
We're waiting for the rays of the morning sun 
Has anybody seen the morning sun? 

I'm lost in a world, beyond lost city
I'm looking for a phone, and I cant find one 
Gotta Tony Bennett eight track in the hotel pity 
The moon turned and shot someone 
I'm lost in a mack truck jack, in the city of words 
Only dead men stomp on the brake pedals, in the city of nerves
Sow me some reaps, Jack, I'm dead on the heap 
Show me some glycerine, Mac, downhill so steep 
And im waiting for the rays of the morning sun 
Somebody tell me clearly has the new world begun?
Let all the wailing wail, let the drummer drum 
We're waiting for the rays of the morning sun 
Has anybody seen the morning sun? 

The whole city is a debris of broken heels and party hats
I'm standing on the corner, thats on a fold on the map 
I lost my friends at the deportee station 
I'll take immigration into any nation 

And im waiting for the rays of the morning sun
Somebody tell me clearly has the new world begun?
Let all the wailing wail, let the drummer drum 
We're waiting for the rays of the morning sun 
Has anybody seen the morning sun? 

Who is that Screaming in Lunar Park?
If they make Tony Adams captain 
We could all go screaming in Lunar Park
I say yes oh yes - you should check it out
