the room is empty 
the lights are dim 
and my heart wonders 
if I'll ever see you again 

my tears are hungry 
for an open door 
when your arms held me 
I never felt that way before 

I'll be waiting 
I'll be watching 
under a blue moon 
the taste of heaven 
only happens 
once in a blue moon 

once in a blue moon 

do you remember 
when the wind blew free 
and we fit together 
so naturally 

if the wind closes a door 
it will open another
