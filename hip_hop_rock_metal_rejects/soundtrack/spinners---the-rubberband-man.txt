the lyrics

Hand me down my walkin' cane
Hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late
'Cause we ain't got time to chat

You and me we're goin' out 
To catch the latest sounds
Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down

Hey, y'all prepare yourself
For the Rubberband man
You never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the Rubberband starts to jam

Oh, Lord, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does
seems to come out right

Once I went to hear them play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized
By the sound this cat's puttin' down

When I saw this short fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard 'cause the man got down
When he finally reached his goal

Hey, y'all prepare yourself
For the Rubberband man
You never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the Rubberband starts to jam

Got that rubberband
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Where in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord
Doo doo doo doo doo
Lord, help him get away

Hey, y'all prepare yourself
For the Rubberband man
You never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the Rubberband starts to jam

Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Rubberband man, Rubberband man
How much of this stuff do he think we can stand
So much rhythm, grace and debonair from one man, Lord
And then he had nerve to wiggle his left toe
To his knee, got the feelin' in his head, y'all
Ah, come on, baby

Hey, y'all prepare yourself
For the Rubberband man
You never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the Rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband man starts to jam
Movin' up and down across the land
Got people all in his ways
Everything about him seems out of place

Just a movin', just a movin', just a move-move-movin'
Just a Rubberband, Rubberband man
Just a movin', just a movin', just a move-move-movin'
Just a Rubberband, Rubberband man

Get down
Oh, get down lover
Uh-huh
