[Fat Joe] 
Uhh, T.S.! 
None better Bronx niggaz, uhh 
Life of a hustler ha-hah, what'chu know about that? 
Yo, yo, yo 
Yo the mind of a hustler be trained to count money and lies 
Supplyin customers and keep it peace and just spendin they time 
Pop another thug that's tryin to scream but they dimes 
Hoppin all the clubs in town, they don't need to wear shines 
They got that energy, confident and always aware 
who's watchin them, bitches on top of them, they don't just be near 
Probably spot poppy and them they robbed last year 
and just, nod and stare and show no fear 
Cause nine times out of ten this bitch connects this kid to shoot you 
They too hot so catchin a body's too crucial 
If you a hustler, I know you relate 
Whether you home base or go out of state 
This shit is real 
and you better recognize when you see 'em, these niggaz kill 
A whole 'nother drug dealer keep 'em with steels 
So be creepin so it's real on the deal, with the F-E-D 
Some of them sleep in six feet cause they skrilled 

[Chorus: Armageddon] 
Fuckin with hustlers - you see us in the clubs 
Everybody wanna be us, wife beaters and flip drugs 
We them hustlers - a little thug's role model 
Where the snubb full of hollow's tryna earn a little power 
He a hustler - some of us locked for eternity 
Get shot down and murdered in beef or turnin for police 
Hustlers - yeah, you know what the sparks done 
You know where we evolve from, you know when the heart's pump 
Hustlin

[Fat Joe - overlapping end of Chorus] 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
See life a style, now it's rappin, how you push packs in large amounts 
and never spend a day in life movin them cats about? 
That's not what Crack's about; I cooked it, cut it and lift it 
From Brooklyn to one-sixty fiddith, I took bricks and flip shit 
Clips I sit 'em even whip some women from runnin they lips 
and gettin me in the middle of shit with other niggaz 
And real dealers don't be yappin on the phone 
What you think, father born?  Don't be caskets and clothes 
C'mon y'all know niggaz slip, speakin a joke 
There go the dial tone, click, now you steamin with holes 
Y'all motherfuckers couldn't fathom what's about to go down 
Like a year from now, when the bears get out 
From a ten-year stretch down to air shit out 
Make him a man, show your heart when I tear it out 
They say hustlin is the key to success, and on that note 
I can feed you niggaz for less, I got madd coke 

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe] 
Yeah, it's for all my hustlin niggaz 
All my liquid dime niggaz 
All my niggaz flippin bricks out there, yeah 
All my niggaz in the Columbia brother suits 
In the pourin rain, tryna get your shit on 
Smokin the C.I. in the rain, y'know? uh-huh 
Cup of noodles in your hand 
It's you nigga Joey Coco, and I'm a hustler 

[Chorus]
