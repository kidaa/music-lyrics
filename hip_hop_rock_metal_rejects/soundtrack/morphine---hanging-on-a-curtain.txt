the lyrics

Hanging on a curtain...curtain, curtain
swinging like a clock, clock, clock
Big hand on the seven, seven, seven
the little hand on top top top
You said you like to hear me talk, talk
You told me not to stop, You told me not to stop
You said you like to hear me talk, talk
You told me not to stop, You told me not to stop

Little red feet with big blue toes,
let me put my hands inside your clothes
Little red feet with big blue toes,
let me put my hands inside your clothes
Cute button like pointy little teeth
Oh...Don't bite please! Don't bite please.
Cute button like pointy little teeth
Oh...Don't bite please!

Little red feet with big blue toes,
let me put my hands inside your clothes

Hanging on a curtain...curtain, curtain
swinging like a clock, clock, clock
Big hand on the seven, seven, seven
the little hand on top top top
You said you like to hear me talk, talk
You told me not to stop, You told me not to stop
