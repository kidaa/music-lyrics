Lun That
I have dreamed that arms are lovely,
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be.
I have dreamed every word you whisper.
When your close,
Close to me.
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view.
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you-
I will love being loved by you.

Tuptim
Alone and awake I've looked at the stars,
The same that smile on you;
And time and again 
I've thought all the things
That you were thinking too.
I have dreamed that arms are lovely,
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be.
I have dreamed every word you whisper.
When your close,
Close to me.
How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view.
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know-

Both
What it's like to be loved by you-
I will love being loved by you.
