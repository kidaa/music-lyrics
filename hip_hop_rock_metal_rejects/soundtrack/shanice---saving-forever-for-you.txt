Hooooh

I've never been so sure
About anything before
But this loving feeling
Gonna be a feeling I feel forever more

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you

Hoohohoh

You'll be my world
As long as there's a world turning 'round
And you'll be my heaven
Baby, till the heavens all come falling down [All come falling down]

Look inside my heart [Oh, yeah]
Love is all you'll see
Loving you forever, baby
Living just to be

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you

Forever I'll be loving you
Long as time passes by
I'll be there beside you, ho
Through it all, I'll be standing by you

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be
Needing you here with me

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever, saving forever for you

Saving forever Yeah for you Hoooohooh
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to You are the only one
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby Heyeyey
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever, saving forever for you

Saving forever for you Hoooohoohooh
You're the only one
I'll ever give forever to I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do
