Music   Lyrics: Louis St. Louis

All: Whoooh ooooh who's that guy?
Whoooh ooooh who's that guy?
Davey: He came out of the darkness in the middle of the night,
Blazing like a mother with a fist of dynamite.
The T-Birds: He ain't foolin' no one on that pile of chrome and steel,
Burnin' up the pavement like he was some kind of wheel.
The Scorpions: He's lookin' for a rumble and some heads are gonna bust,
He's gonna take a tumble with one solitary thrust!
Pink Ladies: The only thing you guys are gonna do is eat his dust! 

Who's that guy?
Where did he come from?
Who's that guy?
The T-Birds: Please tell me someone.
Pink Ladies: I never knew anyone could be so cool.
All: Whoa oh oh
Who's that guy?
He's just amazin'!
From headlight to tailpipe, his burners are blazin'.
Pink Ladies: Looks to me like he could really fly! 

Who's that guy, who's that guy?
Whooo ooooh who's that guy?
Whooo ooooh who's that guy? 

Davey: He wears a pair of goggles like a man from outer space.
Stephanie: It really doesn't matter that I haven't seen his face.
The Scorpions: We're gonna wrap those handlebars around that neck of his.
The punk is gonna get it!
All: When we find out who he is!
Michael: Everybody wants you when they don't know who you are.
Pink Ladies: If you're a man of mystery, it really takes you far.
Michael: Everyone around you thinks that you're a star! 

Who's that guy?
Paulette: Where did he come from?
Who's that guy?
Stephanie: Where can I get one?
Michael: They never knew that I could be so cool!
Whoa oh oh
Who's that guy?
Pink Ladies: On that motorcycle
Michael: What would they say if they knew it was Michael?
All: Looks to me like he could really fly!

Won't somebody tell me...Who's that guy?
All: Whoooh ooooh who's that guy?
Whoooh ooooh who's that guy? 

Who's that guy?
Where did he come from?
Who's that guy?
The T-Birds: Please tell me someone.
Pink Ladies: I never knew anyone could be so cool.
All: Whoa oh oh
Who's that guy?
He's just amazin'!
From headlight to tailpipe, his burners are blazin'.
Looks to me like he could really fly!

Won't somebody tell me
Whoooo's that guy? Stephanie: Where did he come from?
Whoooo's that guy? Stephanie: Where can I get one?
Whoooo, whoooo, whoooo?
All: Whoa oh oh
Whoooo's that guy? Stephanie: Dressed in leather
Whoooo's that guy? Stephanie: 
Whoooo, whoooo, whoooo? etc.
