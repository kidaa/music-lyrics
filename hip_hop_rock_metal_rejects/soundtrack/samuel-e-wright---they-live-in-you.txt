Ingonyama nengw' enamabala 

Night
And the spirit of life calling 
Mamela
And a voice 
With the fear of a child asking 
Mamela

Wait
There's no mountain too great 
Hear these words and have faith 
Have faith 

They live in you 
They live in me 
They're watching over 
Everything we see 
In every creature 
In every star 
In your reflection 
They live in you 

They live in you 
They live in me 
They're watching over 
Everything we see 
In every creature 
In every star 
In your reflection 
They live in you 

Ingonyama nengw' enamabala
