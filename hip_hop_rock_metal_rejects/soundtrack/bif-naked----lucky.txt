it was a monday, when my lover told me, 
 never pay the reaper with love only.  
what could i say to you, except,  i love you.  
and  i'd give my life for yours.  

i know we are we are the lucky ones.
i know we are we are the lucky ones.
i know we are we are the lucky ones, dear.

the first time we made love, i i wasn't sober. 
and you told me you loved me over and over! 
how could i ever love another, when i miss you every day

remember the time we made love in the roses? 
and you took my picture in all sorts of poses! 
how could i ever get over you, when i'd give my life for yours.

i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are we are the lucky ones, dear. 

my dear, It's time to say i thank god for you. 
i thank god for you in each and every single way. 
and, i know... i know.. i know.. i know... 

it's time to let you know. time to let you know. 
time to let you know. time to sit here and say: 

i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are we are the lucky ones, dear.
we are the lucky ones, dear...
