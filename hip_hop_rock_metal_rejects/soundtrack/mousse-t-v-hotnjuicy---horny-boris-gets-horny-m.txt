You got me horny in the morning 
And you know uh oh 
I tried to call you 
but I cant find a telephone 
I sent a message through the internet 
But it rejected 
I wrote a letter and I sent it 
with the postoffice 
the post it takes so long 
so I had to sing this song 
to let you know how I feel 
what's the deal baby 
and I cant wait for you 
and the things you make me do 
my heart is ringin 
so I'm singin this song for you 

I'm horny 
horny horny horny 
so horny 
I'm horny horny horny 
I'm horny 
horny horny horny 
so horny 
I'm horny horny horny tonight 

I search from town to town 
But I can't find my bedroom 
I got so desperate that I sent a rocket to the moon 
in new York city someone said they saw you singin the blues 
But it was a man from nowhere land 
that looked like you 
and I will keep searching on 
this feeling's much to strong 
my heart is ringin 
so I'm singin this song for you for you for you for you 

I'm horny 
horny horny horny 
so horny 
I'm horny horny horny 
I'm horny 
horny horny horny 
so horny 
I'm horny horny horny tonight
