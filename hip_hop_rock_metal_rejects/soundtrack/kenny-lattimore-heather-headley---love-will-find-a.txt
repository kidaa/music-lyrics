Music by Tom Snow, lyrics by Jack Feldman 

In a perfect world 
One we've never known 
We would never need to face the world alone 

They can have their world 
We'll create our own 
I may not be brave or strong or smart 
But somewhere in my secret heart 

I know 
Love will find a way 
Anywhere I go 
I'm home 
If you are there beside me 

Like dark turning into day 
Somehow we'll come through 
Now that I've found you 
Love will find a way 

I was so afraid 
Now I realize 
Love is never wrong 
And so it never dies 

There's a perfect world 
Shining in your eyes 
And if only they could feel it too 
The happiness I feel with you 

They'd know 
Love will find a way 
Anywhere we go 
We're home 
If we are there together 

Like dark turning into day 
Somehow we'll come through 
Now that I've found you 
Love will find a way 

I know 
Love will find a way 
Anywhere we go 
I'm home 
If we are there together 

Like dark turning into day 
Somehow we'll come through 
Now that I've found you 
Love will find a way 

I know love will find a way
