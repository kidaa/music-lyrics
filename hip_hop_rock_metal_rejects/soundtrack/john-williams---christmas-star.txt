Distant stars, at home up in the heavens.
Wonder what they see, are they watching me?
Christmas Star, you spin your strands of silver.
What a sight to see, are you there to guide me?

Star light, shine bright.
See me through the dark night.
Light mine, half way;
Guide me home for Christmas Day.

Midnight stars, they sail the sky in silence.
Hearing all they see, are they hearing me?
Christmas Star, you watch the world so wisely;
At my journey's end, will you be my true friend?

Star light, shine bright.
See me through the dark night.
Light mine, half way;
Guide me home for Christmas Day.

Christmas Star light,
See me on my way.
Light mine, half way;
Guide me home for Christmas Day.
