Bullseye my pony, Bullseye my pride
Bullseye mi amigo, Bullseye I will ride
Across the wide prairie, beneath the blue sky
We'll ride on forever just me and Bullseye 
It was out in west Texas at the Triple 'R' sale
When I first laid eyes on that
Bullseye broomtail
He bounced and he bucked and he ran like the wind
And when I rode out I was a-leading my friend 

Hey, Bullseye my pony, Bullseye my pride
Bullseye mi amigo, Bullseye I will ride
Across the wide prairie, beneath the blue sky
We'll ride on forever just me and Bullseye 

One midnight in August it came up a storm
The cattle stampeded, the lightning did swarm
A cowboy who fell was a cowboy who'd die
Well lucky for me I was a-riding Bullseye 

Hey, Bullseye my pony, Bullseye my pride
Bullseye mi amigo, Bullseye I will ride
Across the wide prairie, beneath the blue sky
We'll ride on forever just me and Bullseye 

Now if ever I find me a cowgirl so true
Who'll keep a loose rein on this old buckaroo
Well if she's got a mare and a twinkling eye
Boys I might settle there and raise little Bullseyes 

Hwy, Bullseye my pony, Bullseye my pride
Bullseye mi amigo, Bullseye I will ride
Across the wide prairie, beneath the blue sky
We'll ride on forever just me and Bullseye 

We'll ride on forever just me and Bullseye
