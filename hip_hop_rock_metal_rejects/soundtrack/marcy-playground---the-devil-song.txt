Some kids they know how to fight 
Some kids run 
I'm a thousand generations ahead of them 
Cool as they come 

See all my suits are Calvin Kline 
My lucky number is 69 
I got all the things I need 
It's the nature of my breed 

I'm independent 
Smooth and confident 
Always in command 
Graceful element 
A tasteful compliment 
Do you know who I am 

Look up, look down, watch out the tiger is on the town tonight 
I'm a deadly handsome man 
Look up, look down, watch out the tiger is on the town tonight 
I'm the lion in the lamb 

Everywhere I go I make the seen 
The ladies love to stroke me 
Pimped out and lazy in my limousine 
Oh come on here sweetie 
Everything I say like Socrates 
People love to quote me 
My real name is Mephistopheles 
But you can call me baby
