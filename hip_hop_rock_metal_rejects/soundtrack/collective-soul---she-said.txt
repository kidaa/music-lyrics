She said that time is unfair
To a woman her age 
Now that wisdom has come
Everything else fades
She said she realizes
She's seen better days
She said she can't look back
To her days of youth
What she though were lies
She later found was truth
She said her daddy had dreams
But he drank them away
And her mother's to blame
For the way she is today

Life's river shall rise
She said
And only the strong shall survive
She said
But I'm feeling quite weak
She said
Will you comfort and forgive me?
She said

She says she's still searching 
For salvations light
Yeah she wishes all day
And then she prays all night
She says she won't speak of love
'Cause love she's never known
And it's moments like these
That she hates to be alone

Life's river shall rise
She said
And only the strong shall survive
She said
But I'm feeling quite weak
She said
Will you comfort and forgive me?
