the lyrics

They're gonna put me in the movies 
they're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
and all I gotta do is act naturally 

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star 
might win an Oscar you can never tell 
the movies gonna make me a big star 
'Cause I can play the part so well 

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies 
then I know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time 
and all I gotta do is act naturally 

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
and beggin down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal 
all I gotta do is act naturally 

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star 
might win an Oscar you can never tell 
the movies gonna make me a big star 
'Cause I can play the part so well 

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies 
then I know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time 
and all I gotta do is act naturally
