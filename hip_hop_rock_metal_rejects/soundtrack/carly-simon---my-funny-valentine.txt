You're my funny valentine, 
Sweet comic valentine, 
You make me smile with my heart 
You're looks are laughable, unphotographable 
Yet you're my favourite work of art 
Is your figure less than Greek, 
Is your mouth a little weak 
When you open it to speak are you smart 
But don't change a hair for me 
Not if you care for me 
Stay little valentine, stay 

Each day is Valentine's Day
