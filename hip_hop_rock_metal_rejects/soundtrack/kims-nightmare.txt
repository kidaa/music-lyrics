as the room darkens, the ghost of THUY appears

THUY
did you think I'd gone away
this is the face you saw that day
staring at you with open eyes
you're safe in the daylight
but in the dark I rise

I'm the crime that you hid
for you want yo forget that you killed, but you did!
you will never be free
not as long as there's me

did you think you would escape the judgement that was planned?
did you think you would escape the truth's avenging hand
just because you have escaped the bound'ries of your land
I'm here! I'm here! I'm never dead
I'm here! I am the guilt inside your head

KIM finds herself back in Saigon, April 1975

you think your marine's not like other men

CHRIS appears

he betrayed you once 
and he will again
think about that night
where was he back then

CHRIS
I'm getting you out!

CAPTAIN SCHULTZ
sorry, sergeant, as things degenerate
all I'm giving her is her emigration papers
without the wait, sign here

CHRIS
that's not good enough. . .

CAPTAIN SCHULTZ
this will get her on board the carrier
you're declaring that you will marry her
when you get back to the states, sign here

a solider brings in KIM

SOLDIERS

the embassy will close according to plan

CAPTAIN SCHULTZ
I'll stretch a couple rules to issue her pass
that's it, you're ready. nice ass. who's next?

SOLDIERS
by order of the old man

CAPTAIN SCHULTZ

The scene changes to the room of CHRIS and KIM

CHRIS

CHRIS

REEVES

as fast as we load the planes, we're gone
a huge crowd of VIETNAMESE is pushing at the Embassy gates

JOHN

CHRIS is forced inside the Embassy, whose doors are then barricaded. 
The VIETNAMESE are now yelling through the Embassy gates.

ONE VIETNAMESE

ANOTHER
I have a letter, look!

ANOTHER

A VIETNAMESE
out of my way, if that's all that you've got!

CROWD

inside the compound: MARINES guard the roof helipad.

CHRIS
let me go, John, I can't leave her
why in the world should I be saved instead of her?

CROWD
they'll kill who they find here!
don't leave us behind here!

JOHN
it's not you, it's the war that's cruel
and if some dreams get smashed, perhaps it's best they were

CROWD and KIM
there is no one to find here!
they have left us behind here!

JOHN
wake up, my friend, your mercy trip has failed
there's nothing you can do, that ship has sailed
she's not the only one we'll have betrayed

CROWD

the CROWD tries to batter down the fences.

KIM
in the yard
oh, Chris
I still believe
the heart of you
is here with me
my heart, against all odds
holds still

on the Embassy roof, the last helicopter lands. CHRIS runs up and down 
the wall, shouting for KIM. Finally he is forced to board the helicopter, 
which takes off. The nightmare passes. KIM is in her little room with 
TAM.

KIM takes out her wedding dress and puts it on

KIM
you are sunlight and I moon
joined by the gods of fortune
midnight and high noon
that's what we are
how in one night have we come so far
outside, day starts to dawn
one long night time is gone
I feel you near
I cry no more
I know you're here
I reach your door
and our love is reborn!
bright'ning the sky 
with the flame
of love
made of sunlight
moonlight

ENGINEER
Kim! Kim! Chris isat this hotel! Go quickly!

KIM
take care of Tam!

KIM runs through the city of Bangkok to CHRIS'S hotel, as CHRIS and JOHN travel throughout the city to find her.
