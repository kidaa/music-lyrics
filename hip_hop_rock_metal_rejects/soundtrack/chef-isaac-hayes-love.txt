Chef: I'm bona fide, solidified, and qualified to do
Anything your heart can stand, it all depends on you
I'll turn your world upside-down, I'll blow your mind to pieces,
You'll recommend me to your mother, your sister, your aunts and your nieces!

Listed in the Yellow Pages all around the world,
30 years experience in loving sweet young girls, just call


Good love6-9969
Good love6-9969
Good love6-9969

It ain't how good I make it, baby, it's how I make it good!
I'm the king of the woman's world, they tell it from town to town,
And when I find a deserving queen, I'm gonna share my crown
But if the line is busy, don't freak out or get nervous,
You just keep on dialing again and again until you get some service, call

Good love6-9969
Good love6-9969
Good love6-9969

I'll send you temperature higher, just like a ball of fire!

Now listen to me, baby...
Just let your finger do the walking...
Let ol' Chef do the talkin' and the lovin'...
You see, I'm a backdoor man...
And I do the things your man fail to do...

Now, I dunno, but I've been told,
By a playa-hater
That my bedroom is a disguise
For a freak incubator

So if you see a fine young woman that can't be satisfied,
Send her over to my stable, I'm a horny junkie that loves to ride! call

Good love6-9969
Good love6-9969
Good love6-9969

It ain't how good I make it, baby, it's how I make it good!

Call me anytime...
Right now would be fine...
Call my number!
Call on me...
Love gravy train...
I'll ride ya on in to glory...
Let's get it on...
Let's get it on...
Good Love!
