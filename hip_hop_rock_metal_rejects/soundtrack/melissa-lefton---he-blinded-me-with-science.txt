It's poetry in motion 
He turned his tender eyes to me 
As deep as any ocean 
As sweet as any harmony 
But he blinded me with science 
He blinded me with science 
And failed me in biology, ye-ah, ye-ah 

When I'm dancing close to him 
Blinded me with science Science, uh huh, science 

I can smell the chemicals Chemicals 
Blinded me with science Science 

But it's poetry in motion Tion, tion 
And when he turned his eyes to me 
When he turned his eyes to me 
As deep as any ocean 
As sweet as any harmony 
He blinded me with science 
He blinded me with science With science 
And failed me in geometry 

When he's dancing next to me 
Blinded me with science Science 

I can hear machinery 
Blinded me with science Science 

But he blinded me with science 
He blinded me with science 
And hit me with technology Uh huh, uh huh 

Good heavens, Jimmy 
You saved the day 
I don't believe it 
There he goes again 
He's tidied up now I 
Can't find anything 
Oh, my tubes and wires 
And careful notes 
And antiquated motions 

It's poetry in motion 
He turned his tender eyes to me 
When he turned his eyes to me 
As deep as any ocean 
As sweet as any harmony 
He blinded me with science 
He blinded me with science 
He blinded me with 
huh huh huh huh huh huh ho, oh
