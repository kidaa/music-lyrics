the lyrics  

I've been really tryin', baby  
Tryin' to hold back this feelin' for so long  
And if you feel like I feel, baby  
Then come on, oh come on  
Let's get it on, oh baby  
Let's get it on  
Let's love, baby  
Let's get it on  
Sugar, let's get it on  

We're all sensitive people  
With so much to give  
Understand me, sugar  
Since we got to being  
Let's live  
I love you  

There's nothing wrong with me  
Lovin' you, baby no no  
And givin' yourself to me could never be wrong  
If the love is true, oh baby  

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful  
Life can be  
I'm asking you baby  
To get it on with me  

I ain't gonna worry  
I ain't gonna push  
I won't push you baby  
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on baby  
Stop beatin' 'round the bush  

Let's get it on  
Let's get it on  
You know what I'm talkin' about  
Come on baby, hey hey  
Let your love come out  
If you believe in love  
Let's get it on  
Let's get it on, baby  
This minute, oh yeah  
Let's get it on  
Please get it on  

So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on darlin'  
Stop beatin' 'round the bush  

Gonna get it on  
I wanna get it on  
You don't have to worry that it's wrong  
If the spirit moves ya  
Let me groove ya... good  

Let your love come down  
Get it on, come on baby
