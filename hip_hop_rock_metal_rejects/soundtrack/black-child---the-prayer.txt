[Black Child] 
Ghetto gospel 
All thugs gotta pray 
Hear me Lord, yo 

If killin niggaz is wrong, God forgive me for my sins 
and all my evil thoughts like fuckin my girlfriends 
God bless my family, and the bitch I bagged in the Camry 
and any extra guns that come in handy 
Not to play but pray for things that's corrupt 
But the Lord knows this world, is all fucked up uh-huh 
In God's eyes, every nigga is created equal 
To some crackers, we evil cause we livin lethal Fuck 'em! 
And anything we gots to get, gotsta get got NIGGA 
Even if somebody, gotsta get shot NIGGA 
Why not?  A whole lot of thugs died on my block 
And I see the killer's still free, so fuck cops! Fuck 'em 
We got no love for the Lord, that's why we pack gats 
When them shots pop, bitch cops, where they at? uh-huh 
Probably somewhere, at Dunkin Donuts 
while Black Child got niggaz on the corner with they hands cuffed 

[Chorus: Black Child] 
Now let me load my heat, before I go to sleep 
And pray to God I don't end up six feet deep 
Cause if I die, before I wake 
Let me die on some pape's and all my niggaz at my wake 
I said, if I die, before I wake 
Let me die on some pape's and all my bitches at my wake 

[Black Child] 
God, please forgive me for all my sins Lord, please - Psalms 23 

The Lord is my sheppard and the gun's my weapon 
Reppin my upper sections yeah they blessed with protection nigga 
It's nothin on this earth, that my soldiers wore 
Copped a house, a big Benz, all my friends puff blunts 
Nigga we lust to bust, and guns we trust 
The gods copped me a path, now that's right-eous 
I'm tight cause my peeps was breathin they last breath 
Where we was, bubblin, in the, valley of death 
I went to jail and end up bein the last nigga left 
Now I, fear no evil and hear no evil 
Just threw the silencer, on my Desert Eagle 
Nigga to free my people, I'm prepared for the enemy 
And thugs who won't pull out and put slugs up in me 
Lord gave me the energy, now pass the Hennessy 
Word to God, all y'all niggaz is gon' remember me 
Heh, Black Child, Black Child 

[Chorus]

[Black Child] 
Shit, if I die 
Lord, have mercy - street niggaz pray 

Now let me hit the streets so my kids could eat 
Compton!  Oakland!  Inglewood!  Long Beach! 
All the thugs in the street got love for me 
Hollis!  South Side!  B.K.!  Q.B.! 
I don't give a fuck nigga, I die for I-N-C 
And ride for, e'ybody that'll ride for me 
All my bitches out there that gave me slow nizzie 
when bottles of Remi, keep 'em so pissy 

[Chorus]

[Black Child] 
There's no lookin back 
Word to God 
Bless all my hood people, all my good people.. 
Aight c'mon nigga, let's go..
