All you have to do
Is give up all desires
All you have to do
Is say Om
Stay home
Say Om

Everyone should be Buddha

We are all one
No more war toys
Use high octane
And feel the tiger in your tank

Hustling is an honest profession

Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb of the loom
Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
