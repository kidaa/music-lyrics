Girl, when I first met you I didn't realize
You were looking to stay around
But I was looking to play around
Now I can't forget you
Can't forget your pretty smile
Took for granted the love you gave
And only thought of the love we made
Just when I found someone who could love me
Like the way that I need
I acted a fool and pushed her away from me

And I'll be thinking bout you every night and every day
Cause in my heart I'll know that I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so that I never should have let you go

Do you think about me like I wasn't worth your time
I would give anything I have
If you give me another chance
Do you think you're better off without me
Playing games with your heart and mind, oh yeah
I don't blame you for leaving me
But now you gotta believe in me
If you come back, girl, I promise
That you'll see a change in my ways
I'll get down on my knees
I'll do anything you say

And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know that I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so that I never should have let you go

Is there someone else standing where I stood
Giving you the love you never got from me
Girl, I would give you the world if I only could
Girl, you will see
Will you come back to me
Won't you come back to me

And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know that I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so that I never should have let you go

And I'll be thinking bout you every night and every day
Cause in my heart I'll know that I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so
No, I never should have let
No, I never should have let
No, I never should have let you go

Oh...
