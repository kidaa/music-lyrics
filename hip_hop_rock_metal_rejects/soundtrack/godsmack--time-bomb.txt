I AM IN A LIVING HELL, MAKES ME WONDER IF I'M ALIVE. 
CAN'T SEEM TO BRING MYSELF TO FIGURE OUT WHY. 
I SHOVE AND I PULL AWAY FROM THE THINGS THAT I CAL YOU EVERY NIGHT,
I CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK YOU DOWN BUT I KNOW I'LL COME AROUND... 

 I FEEL YOUR PINS THRU MY EYES PIERCING ME  

LIE DOWN IN ALL THIS PISS, YOU DRINK IT FROM ME EVERY NIGHT. 
I LIVE IN A WORLD OF SHIT, BEEN LEFT HERE TO DIE. 
SOMETIMES I REALIZE MY MIND IS MEANT TO GO AWAY. 
NEVER HAVE I SEEN YOUR GOD, SO WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE IN FAITH? 

chorus:  I FEEL YOUR PINS THROUGH MY EYES PIERCING ME, ALL THE TIME  

 ANOTHER TIME BOMB  repeat 1st verse, chorus 

I NEVER FIND THE TIME TO FIND ANOTHER FUCKING PLACE, 
I'M A BAD MOTHERFUCKER WHO LIVES IT EVERYDAY, 
YOU NEVER LOOK AT ME NOW, YOU NEVER LOOK ME IN THE FACE, 
 I'M A TIME BOMB BABY  I CAN'T FIND THE TIME TO FIND THE PLACE,
I'M A BAD MOTHERFUCKER WHO LIVES IT EVERYDAY, 
YOU NEVER LOOK AT ME NOW, YOU NEVER LOOK ME IN THE FACE,  I'M A TIME BOMB  

WHAT AM I WAITING FOR? 

NEVER FIND THE TIME TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE, 
I'M A BAD MOTHERFUCKER WHO LIVES IT EVERYDAY,
YOU NEVER LOOK AT ME NOW, YOU NEVER LOOK ME IN THE FACE,  I'M A TIME BOMB YEAH!
