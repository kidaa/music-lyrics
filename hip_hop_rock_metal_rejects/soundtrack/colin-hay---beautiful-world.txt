My my my it's a beautiful world 
I like swimming in the sea 
I like to go out beyond the white breakers 
Where a man can still be free or a woman if you are one 
I like swimming in the sea. 

My my my  it's a beautiful world 
I like drinking Irish tea 
With a little bit of lapsang souchong 
I like making my own tea. 

My my my it's a beautiful world 
I like driving in my car 
Roll the top down sometimes I travel quite far 
Drive to the ocean stare up at the stars 
I like driving in my car 

All around is anger automatic guns 
It's death in large numbers no respect for women or our little ones 
I tried talking to Jesus but He just put me on hold 
Said He'd been swamped by calls this week 
And He couldn't shake His cold 

And still this emptiness persists 
Perhaps this is as good as it gets 
                             When you've given up the drink and those nasty cigarettes 
Now I leave the party early at least with no regrets 
I watch the sun as it comes up I watch it as it sets 
Yeah this is as good as it gets. 

My my my it's a beautiful world 
I like sleeping with Marie 
She is one sexy girl full of mystery 
She says she doesn't love me but she likes my company 
For now that's good enough for me
