Lyrics: Michael Gibson

I'm all dressed up in my finest attitude
Pretending I don't care.
Guess I really messed up by trying to be two,
When only one heart can be there.
Why can't I be just what I am,
And speak my love without any shame?
Why can't she see what I am,
Is a costumed fool trapped in a tragic game? 

Charades and pretty lies
They hide what's deep inside me.
Charades do disguise
All the love I keep inside me.
Charades! Can't see me,
But can you feel the real me,
The real me behind my charades? 

Oh, please don't mind me,
Performing at my hardest
As I paint upon the air.
You won't find me
Cause it's a portrait of the artist
As a man who isn't there. 

Chorus 

Can't you feel the real me,
Behind my charades?
Have I lost the real me,
Behind my charades?
