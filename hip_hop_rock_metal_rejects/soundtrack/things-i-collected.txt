I don't need another long talk
about what's wrong with you and me
And I don't need another conversation
about the way we're supposed to be
Now I see that you're gone
and I don't believe that everything
I have to get over you

Pre-chorus:
How could you make me love you and then just walk away
Like you never did a thing to lead me on in any kind of way
How could you make me feel so helpless every day
From the path you laid before me
These are things I collected along the way

Chorus:
I got tears in my ears sometimes and I got a bad case of sleep last night
And I got holding you on my mind and 
I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day
But these are things I collected along the way

Everytime I think about it I hate it in every way
Said I thought I couldn't live without you
but I live with it every day
Never thought I'd see the day that you would ever leave
But now I'm here sifting through memories

Chorus:
I got tears in my ears sometimes and I got a bad case of sleep last night
And I got holding you on my mind holding you all the time
And I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time 
I gotta get you back in my life
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day 
that's a lot of weight to carry, lot of weight to carry
all the things I collected along the way

Chorus:
I got tears in my ears sometimes and I got a bad case of sleep last night 
I don't think you know what I'm talkin' about
And I got holding you on my mind holding you all the time
And I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time I gotta get you off my mind
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day 
that's a lot of weight to carry everyday
collected along the way

Chorus:
I got tears in my ears sometimes 
and I got a bad case of sleep last night I got a bad case
And I got holding you on my mind all I wanna do is hold you
And I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time on my mind
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day 
that's a lot of weight to carry everyday
these are things I collected along my journey
