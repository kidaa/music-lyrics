the lyrics 

No, you're never gonna get it Ow! 
Never ever gonna get it No, not this time 
No, you're never gonna get it My love 
Never ever gonna get it 
repeat

I remember how it used to be 
You never was this nice, you can't fool me 
Now you talkin' like you made a change 
The more you talk, the more things sound the same 
What makes you think you can just walk back into her life 
Without a good fight? Oh... 
I just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself 
Cuz you're just wasting your time, oh... 

CHORUS
No, you're never gonna get it Not this time 
Never ever gonna get it My lovin' 
No, you're never gonna get it Had your chance to make a change 
Never ever gonna get it 
repeat

Now you promise me the moon and stars 
Save your breath, you won't get very far 
Gave you many chances to make change 
The only thing you changed was love to hate 
It doesn't matter what you do or what you say 
She doesn't love you, no way 
Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect 
So you won't be hearing her say, "No way" 

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what you do or what you say 
She don't love you, no way 
Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect 
So you won't be hearing her say, "No way" 

[And now it's time for a breakdown...] 

Never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Never gonna get it whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Never gonna get it, never get it 

No, you're never gonna get it Sweet lovin' 
Never ever gonna get it Sweet lovin' 
No, you're never gonna get it My lovin' 
Never ever gonna get it My lovin' 
No, you're never gonna get it Sweet lovin' 
Never ever gonna get it My lovin' 
No, you're never gonna get it Sweet lovin' 
Never ever gonna get it My lovin'...
