Oh baby

Oh.

Check it.

I was just strolling through my life oh baby
When you came to me like summer's end
I could feel my very moves ? were changing
Life would never be the same again

I can see through your intentions baby
One to one that's the way it's going to be today
I can dream those sweet temptations baby
Love could be in it you know that you'll begin it baby

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me
S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

I left my memories of another lover
Long before I knew I felt that way
It was I found my lost illusion
You restored my sense of how to play

I can feel the right connection baby
One to one that's the way it's going to be today
It could still lead to affection baby
Love could be in it you know that you'll begin it baby

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me
S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

You make it hard for me

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

Your lovin' baby

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

For me

Your lovin'

Your lovin'

Ohhh.

Your lovin'

You know you make it hard for me

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me
S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

You kn you make it hard for me

S.O.S. Oh yeah I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

Out of time baby

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

You make it hard for me

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

Your lovin'
Your lovin'

For me

S.O.S. I've been tryin' to do the right thing
But your love's only making it hard for me

Ohhh
