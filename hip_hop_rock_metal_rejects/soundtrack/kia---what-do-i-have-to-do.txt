la-la-love you 
love you 
tell me that it's no use 
love's always been my excuse 
don't tell me it aint right 
my heart is my heart is my alibi 
only you you 
you you 
get me acting crazy like I do do 
do do 
say you cant believe it, but it's true 
it's true 

what do I have to do 
to get the message through 
how can I prove I really love you love you 
what do I have to do 
to get it through to you 
how can I prove I really love you love you 

There aint a single night 
that I have haven't held you tight 
it's always inside my head 
never inside my bed 
I miss you you 
you you 
bringin' out the passion in my soul 
oh
and I've got to have you don't you know 
don't you know 

what do I have to do 
to get the message through 
how can I prove I really love you love you 
what do I have to do 
to get it through to you 
how can I prove I really love you love you 

love you 
love you 
la-la-love you 
whoa
love you 
la-la-love you 
whoa
love you 
la-la-love you 

only you you 
you you 
get me acting crazy like I do do 
do do 
say you cant believe it, but it's true 
it's true 

what do I have to do 
to get the message through 
how can I prove I really love you love you 
what do I have to do 
to get it through to you 
how can I prove I really love you love you 

what do I have to do 
to get the message through 
how can I prove I really love you love you 
what do I have to do 
to get it through to you 
how can I prove I really love you love you 

love you 
love you 

what do I have to do 
to get the message through 
how can I prove I really love you love you 
what do I have to do 
to get it through to you 
how can I prove I really love you love you 

love you
