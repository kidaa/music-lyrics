Chorus: 
Pikachu!
You know that you're the one 
So I choose you
There's no one else I'd rather have 
Here by my side
And you can help me win this fight
Because we need to face 
The challenge that's ahead
Pikachu!
You know there is no other 
I choose you
Because you are my brother
In this game we play 
And if we have to go all day
So we can leave the other 
Masters far behind 

I've been training all my life 
Waiting all this time
For this moment to arrive
And now that it's here 
I don't have the fear
'Cause there's nothing left to hide 

It's me and you
And there's nothing that we can't do
'Cause in the Pokmon World 
Even masters have to learn
They will always find something new 

Repeat Chorus 

I will never doubt the dream 
As long as you're with me
I know that we can reach the top
We're the greatest team 
This game has ever seen
And we'll never ever stop 

Repeat Chorus
