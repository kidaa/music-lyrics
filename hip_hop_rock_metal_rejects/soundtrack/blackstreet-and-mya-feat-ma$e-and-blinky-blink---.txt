CHORUS: 

Take me there, I wanna go there 
Take me there, Let's go there 
Take me to that great place wonders and wishes. 
Take me there, I wanna go there 
Take me there. You know where. 
Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes. 

VERSE ONE: MYA 

Sittin here thinkin bout yesterday 
About what we did and how we used to play 
Just the thought of you brings a smile to my face 
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday 

Where we go, nobody knows 
And what we do, is between me and you 
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place 
Where smiles come to life, and dreams come true 

CHORUS 

VERSE TWO: 

Let's make a wish 
Close your eyes and count to five 
Cuz you know that everything will be alright 
See the magic in your eyes 
Cuz your strong enough 
To bring your dreams to life 

Where we go, Nobody knows 
And what we do, is between me and you 
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place 
I don't want this dream to ever go away 

CHORUS 

RAP ONE: MASE 

Now Angelica's the one with all the exposure 
Dil is the one who drop in the stroller 
Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders 
And Dil cries to sleep 
'Til his eyes get bleak 
I'm identical to Chuckie, Chuckie to petro 
Chuckie get scared, Chuckie says "Let's go". 
If I was a rugrat, it would've been so real 
Me and my twin would've been just like Phil and Lil 

RAP TWO: BLINKY BLINK 

And with one wish, Blink grant you one trip 
When we go in this adventure, who you wanna come with 
See you're my little brother that I'll come get 
Run with, But it's gotta be done quick 
You Chuckie is scared and Tommy is sad 
And Phil and Lil is missing their mom and dad 
So take the time of day 
And we'll find the place 
And I guarantee that we will all get home safe 

MYA: Just take me there!!!!!!
