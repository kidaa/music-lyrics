Na,na,na,na,na,na late at nite
Na,na,na,na,na,na late at nite

I have counted everyday since you've been away
It seemed like a thousand years
and at na,na,na,na,na,na,late at night
na,na,na,na,na,na late at night
I'll sit and count the tears

I have counted all your lies all your alibis
I'm a guy believes just what he hears
and at na,na,na,na,na,na,late at night
na,na,na,na,na,na,late at night
I'll sit and count the tears

She's gone and found somebody new
He may be happy now but soon
He'll be counting everyday that she's been away
It'll seem like a thousand years

and at na,na,na,na,na,na,late at night
na,na,na,na,na,na,late at night
He'll sit and count his tears
He'll sit and count his tears
He'll sit and count his tears
He'll sit....and count his tears
