"Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents your dinner." 

Be our guest! Be our guest! 
Put our service to the test 
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie 
And we provide the rest 
Soup du jour! Hot hors d'oeuvres! 
Why, we only live to serve 
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious 
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes! 
They can sing, they can dance! 
After all, Miss, this is France! 
And a dinner here is never second best 
Go on, unfold your menu 
Take a glance and then you'll 
Be our guest 
Oui, our guest! 
Be our guest! 

Flatware
Beef ragout! 
Cheese souffl! 
Pie and pudding en flamb! 

Lumiere
We'll prepare and serve with flair 
A culinary cabaret! 
You're alone and you're scared 
But the banquet's all prepared 
No one's gloomy or complaining 
While the flatware's entertaining 
We tell jokes, I do tricks 
With my fellow candlesticks 

Flatware
And it's all in perfect taste, that you can bet! 
Come on and lift your glass 
You've won your own free pass 
To be out guest! 

Lumiere
If you're stressed 
It's fine dining we suggest 

All
Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest 

Be our guest, be our guest 
Get your worries off your chest 
Let us say for your entre 
We've an array, may we suggest 
Try the bread, try the soup 
When the croutons loop de loop 
It's a treat for any diner! 
Don't believe me? Ask the china! 
Singing pork, dancing veal 
What an entertaining meal 
How could anyone be gloomy or depressed? 
We'll make you shout encore 
And send us out for more 
So be our guest, be our guest 
Be our guest 

Mrs. Potts 
It's a guest, it's a guest 
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed! 
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord 
I've had the napkins freshly pressed 
With dessert, she'll want tea 
And my dear that's fine with me 

While the cups do their soft-shoeing 
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing! 
I'll get warm, piping hot! 
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot? 
Clean it up! We want the company impressed! 

All
We've got a lot to do 

Mrs. Potts 
Is it one lump or two 
For you, our guest 

All
She's our guest! 

Mrs. Potts 
She's our guest! 

All
She's our guest! 
Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest! 

Lumiere
Life is so unnerving 
For a servant who's not serving 
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon 
Ah, those good old days when we were useful 
Suddenly those good old days are gone 

Ten years we've been rusting 
Needing so much more than dusting 
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills 
Most days we just lay around the castle 
Flabby, fat and lazy 
You walked in and oops-a-daisy! 

All
Be our guest! Be our guest! 
Our command is your request 
It's ten years since we had anybody here 
And we're obsessed 
With your meal, with your ease 
Yes, indeed, we aim to please 
While the candlelight's still glowing 
Let us help you, we'll keep going 

Course by course, one by one! 
'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!" 
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest 
Tonight you'll prop your feet up! 
But for now, let's eat up! 
Be our guest! 
Be our guest! 
Be our guest! 
Please, be our guest!
