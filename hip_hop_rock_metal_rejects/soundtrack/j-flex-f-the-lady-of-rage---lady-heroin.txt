Verse 1:
[J. Flex]
Now when I first met her 
I was down in the dumps
Cause my punks would funk
Some cowed on some chunk like Willy Lumb Lumb
Feelin' sad and mad hurt
That's when this fly honey walked up to me, 
in a brown leather skirt
She sat on my lap
She said: I heard that you rap
She said: I have some prime-time skill that you need to tap
I never met a girl, 
so I front with it
So I took it to crib,
sparked a blunt with it
Hit it
It was the bomb
? on cloud 69
But all of a sudden she start flippin' and scrip talkin'
Like what have you done for me lately
Like she hate me
I wasn't no romance without the ends
She had me drivin' and stealin' and illin', 
just to hit the skins
I was open
You could drive a bus up my nose
My friends tell me 
I shouldn't mess with these type of hoes

Chorus:
Lady Heroin, you know you diss all that
Yo it's the bomb baby
You got me hooked like crack
Got me dealin' over back, 
cause it's the tap that cap
I used to be like a mack
Now I don't know how to act

Snoop sample: The pussy was the bomb, 
               had a nigger on sprung. I was
Shootin' up.
That's that shit in my bloodstream

Snoop sample: The pussy was the bomb, 
               had a nigger on sprung. I was
Shootin' up.
That's that shit in my bloodstream

Verse 2:
[J. Flex]
Even dough I'm a fiend,
I can't break clean
Cause everything so sureme
When she's on the scene
And can't nobody tell me bout my boo
I wore a tattoo
Trackmarks on my arm, black and blue
But she didn't feel the same for me
She had a jalous boyfriend by the name of O.D.
Now O.D. was short for Over Dose
And whenever he got caught,
niggas pushin' on his girl
He made her comatose
Lady heroin had me thinkin',
I could get toe to toe with O.D.
But he showed me
Damn my nigga told me
Told you what?
Not to mess around,
when I had to clown
And now it did me a six foot ditch in the ground
So take it from me, yo
The negro
With a tab on his toe
I'm tellin' ya not get with that ho
The most scariest female 
Once you're under her spell
She crosses your bucksells
And send you on a highway to hell

Chorus

Verse 3:
[The Lady Of Rage]
I'm off in your bloodstream,
snatching your cream
Can't get enough to me
you's fiend to the extreme
A nightmare but not a dream
Realer than real
State once I penetrate you mindstate 
ya never get ya scrilla straight
I'm on a mission to invade your soul
Open up your brains and let me take control
I would be under when I had a love like this
Made you steal and kill for me baby with just one kiss
I could sentence you to die
In the blink of an eye
Of a needle
I think you evil on the sly, 
my supply
Non-stop, skin pop until you drop
Blood watch drippin' out your snotbox
I got your brain locked
Hash lady in the hot spot
Black widow
Stick my tooth in 'em
And check 'em with that China White venom
Than I mo' fill 'em
Swimmin' in that bloodstream
Gotcha
Now you a fiend from lady heroin

Chorus x2

Lady Heroin
Lady Heroin
Lady Heroin
