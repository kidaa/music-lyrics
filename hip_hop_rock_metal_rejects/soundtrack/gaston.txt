Gaston: Richard White 
Lefou: Jesse Corti 

    MAURICE: Help! Someone help me! 
    INNKEEPER : Maurice? 
    MAURICE: Please! Please! I need your help! 
        He's got her, he's got her locked in the  
dungeon
    LEFOU: Who? 
    MAURICE: Belle! We must go! Not a minute to lose! 
    GASTON: Whoa! Slow down Maurice! Who's got Belle locked in 
        a dungeon? 
    MAURICE: A Beast! A horrible, monstrous Beast! 
    BEERDRINKERS:  heckle at MAURICE  
    BEERDRINKER ONE: Is it a big Beast? 
    MAURICE: Huge! 
    BEERDRINKER TWO: With a long, ugly snout? 
    MAURICE: Hideously ugly! 
    BEERDRINKER THREE: And sharp, cruel fangs? 
    MAURICE: Yes, yes! Will you help me? 
    GASTON: All right, old man. We'll help you out. 
    MAURICE: You will? Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
        [Maurice is expelled] 
    INKEEPER: Crazy old Maurice! 
    BEERDRINKER ONE: He's always good for a laugh. 
    GASTON: Crazy old Maurice. Hmmmmm. Crazy old Maurice. Hmm. 

GASTON
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking. 

LEFOU
A dangerous pastime, 

GASTON
I know. 
But that wacky old coot is Belle's father, 
and his sanity's only  so-so . 
Now the wheels in my head have been turning, 
since I looked at that loony old man. 
See, I promised myself I'd be married to Belle, 
and right now I'm evolving a plan! 

to Lefou  
                LEFOU 
If I .... whisper ...             
                    Yes! 
Then we'd ... whisper ...     
                    No!  
Would she? 
... whisper ... Guess!     
                    Now  
I get it! 

BOTH
Let's go! 
No one plots like Gaston, 
Takes cheap shots like Gaston, 
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston. 

Gaston
Yes, I'm endlessly, wildly resourceful 

LeFou
As down to the depths you descend 

Gaston
I won't even be mildly remorseful 

LeFou
Just as long as you get what you 
Want in the end! 

Gaston
Who has brains like Gaston? 

LeFou
Entertains like Gaston? 

Both
Who can make up these endless refrains like Gaston? 
So his marriage we soon will be celebrating! 
My, what a guy! 
Gaston!
