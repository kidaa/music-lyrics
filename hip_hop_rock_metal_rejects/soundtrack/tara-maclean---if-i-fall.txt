Written By Tara MacLean 

It seems so far to go 
It took so long to get here 
Now I'm saying things I swore I'd never say 
And I'm afraid again 

I thought I had it in me 
I used to be so sure 
There I was stronger than ever 
Here I am blaming the hurt 

And if I fall 
I will find a way back to my hands 
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet 
Again 
Sweet little fighter 
Sweet little scar 
Sweet little fire in my heart 

It seems so easy now 
Everything I dreamed about when I was a child 
It looks like a good place here 
So I think I'll stay for awhile 

And if I fall 
I will find a way back to my hands 
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet 
Again 
Sweet little fighter 
Sweet little scar 
Sweet little fire in my heart 

You came here screaming 
And never stopped to listen to your one and only prayer 
A place for you somewhere 

Sweet little fighter 
Sweet little scar 
Sweet little fire in my heart 

And if I fall 
I will find a way back to my hands 
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet 
Again 
Sweet little fighter 
Sweet little scar 
Sweet little fire in my heart
