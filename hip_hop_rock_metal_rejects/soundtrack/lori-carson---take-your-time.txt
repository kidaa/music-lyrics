Oooo 

Take your time and think about it baby 
Take your time, think about it 
Take your time and think about it baby 
I've learned how to wait 
I know how to wait for love 

I was frightened and I treated you badly 
Not 'cause I didn't know just what I had 
I think it scared me to find the real thing 
With so much emotion, such sexual feeling 

Take your time, think about it baby 
Take your time, think about it 
Take your time, think about it baby 
I've learned how to wait 
I know how to wait for love 

Well maybe it's a sign of the times 
There is nothing we can't replace 
Well one of a kind is a joy I find 
When I see your face 
Oooo 

Take your time and think about it baby 
Take your time, think about it 
Take your time, think about it baby 
I've learned how to wait 
I've learned how to wait for love 

Take your time take your time 
Take your time take your time 
Now take your time 
Oooo 
Take your time baby
