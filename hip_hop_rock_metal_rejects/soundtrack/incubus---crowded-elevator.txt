Fifteen minutes to six and fourteen floors to go 
Thirteen suited strangers makes the crowded elevator slow 
And I've got a million words and phrases on the tip of my tongue 
For the only non stranger next to me soon she'll know 
Know, know. So let them stare 
If I cry think of what you'll be and how much you will how I feel me to spill 
Let all of it out right now as and expose every inch in front of them
A twelve more floors your eyes and mine all I need to come clean 
Or should I wait for the lobby, spare the lies
Some 26 nervous eyes argue by the little red numbers passing by 
If I wait one minute longer, I think I will die 
Die, die. It isn't fair. 
If I cry think of what you'll be and how much you will how I feel me to spill 
Let all of it out right now as and expose every inch in front of them
If I cry think of what you'll be and how much you will how I feel me to spill 
Let all of it out right now as and expose every inch in front of them
You help me to feel safe and know 
All the while I've been so inquisitive 
I can't go back cuz now I know how it feels to open up and breathe 
I can't go back cuz now I . . . 
I can't go back cuz now I . . . 
I can't go back cuz now I . . . 
If I cry think of what you'll be and how much you will how I feel me to spill 
Let all of it out right now as and expose every inch in front of them
Yeah 
Infront of them 
Infront of them 
Infront of them
