Say a prayer for the youth of America. 
God bless the youth America. 
I can't stand their sight anymore, 
All the dead kids lying on your door,
And you don't hear a word they're tellin ya. 

You're all dead. You're all dead... You've been wasted. 

Don't believe a thing they're selling ya. 
They got a carrot on a stick in front of ya.
Take it back from a hurting child,
You know they can't even use it now, 
And it was yours in the first place anyway. 

You're all dead. You're all dead... You've been wasted. 

[musical interlude]

You're all dead. You're all dead... Wasted. 

Say a prayer for the youth of America... x4
