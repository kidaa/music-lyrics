You must always remember 

Life can be a challenge 
Life can seem impossible 
It's never easy when so much is on the line 

But you can make a difference 
With courage you can set things right 
The gift to dream and make dreams real 
Is yours and mine 

The power of one 
Begins with believing 
It starts in the heart 
Then flows through the soul 
And changes the world 
Imagine how life will be 
When we stand in unity 
Each of us holds the key 
To the power of one 

Each of us is chosen 
There's a mission just for you 
Just look inside you'll be surprised 
What you can do 

The power of one 
Begins with believing 
It starts in the heart 
Then flows through the soul 
And changes the world 
Imagine how life will be 
When we stand in unity 
Each of us holds the key 
To the power of one 

And one by one 
We can make the world a much better place 

The power of one 
Begins with believing 
It starts in the heart 
Then flows through the soul 
And changes the world 
Imagine how life will be 
When we stand in unity 
Each of us holds the key 
It's inside of you and me 
Each of us holds the key 
To the power of one
