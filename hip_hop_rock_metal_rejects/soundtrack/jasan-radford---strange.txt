Hey! 
It doesn't really matter where you go 
It makes no difference, baby, who you know 
This thing has gotten way out of control 

Hey! 
It doesn't really matter who you are 
You might as well be a super star 
'cause everything has gone way too far, oh-oh-oh 

It's the strangest thing 

It's getting stranger and then 
It's getting harder to win 
It's getting digital then 
It's starts happening all over again 

Hey! 
It makes no difference, baby, what you say 
It's getting weirder every day by day 
I think that something's really gone astray 

Hey! 
It really doesn't matter what you try 
It's getting even harder to deny 
'cause reality has just said good-bye 

It's the strangest thing 

It's getting stranger and then 
It's getting harder to win 
It's getting digital then 
It's starts happening all over again 
It's getting stranger and then 
It's getting harder to win 
It's getting digital then 
It's starts happening all over again 

It's the strangest thing
