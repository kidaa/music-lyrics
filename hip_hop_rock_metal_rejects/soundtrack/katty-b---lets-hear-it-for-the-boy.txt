Let's hear it for the boy 
Let's hear it for my baby 

My baby he don't talk sweet 
He ain't got much to say 
But he loves me loves me loves me 
I know that he loves me anyway 
And maybe he don't dress fine 
But I don't really mind 
Cause everytime he pulls me near 
I just want to cheer 

Let's hear it for the boy 
Let's give the boy a hand 
Let's hear it for my baby 
You got to understand 
Maybe he's no Romeo 
But he's my loving one man show 
Let's hear it for the boy 

My baby may not be rich 
Watching every dime 
But he loves me loves me loves me 
We always have a real good time 
And maybe he sings off key 
But that's alright by me 
Cause when he does 
He does so well 
It makes want to yell 

Let's hear it for the boy 
Let's give the boy a hand 
Let's hear it for my baby 
You got to understand 
Maybe he's no Romeo 
But he's my loving one man show 
Let's hear it for the boy 

Cause when he does he does so well 
It makes want to yell 

Let's hear it for the boy 
Let's give the boy a hand 
Let's hear it for my baby 
You got to understand 
Maybe he's no Romeo 
But he's my loving one man show 
Let's hear it for the boy 
Let's hear it for my baby 
Let's hear it for my man 

Let's hear it for the boy 
Let's hear it for my baby
