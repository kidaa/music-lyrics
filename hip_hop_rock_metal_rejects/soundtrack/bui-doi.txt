In September 1978 JOHN is addressing a conference in Atlanta that 
CHRIS and his wife ELLEN are attending at JOHN'S request.

CHOIR
they're called bui-doi
the dust of life
conceived in hell
and born in strife
they are the living reminders
of all the good we failed to do
we can't forget 
must not forget 
that they are all our children too

JOHN
like all survivors, I once thought
when I'm home I won't give a damn
but now I know I'm caught
I'll never leave Vietnam

war isn't over when it ends
some pictures never leave your mind
they are the faces of the children
the ones we left behind

they're called bui-doi
the dust of life
conceived in hell
and born in strife
they are the living reminders
of all the good we failed to do
we can't forget
must not forget
that they are all our children too

these kids hit walls on every side
they don't belong in any place
their secret they can't hide 
it's printed on their face

I never thought one day I'd plead
for half-breeds from a land that's torn
but then I saw a camp for children 
whose crime was being born

they're called bui-doi
the dust of life
conceived in hell
and born in strife
we owe them fathers, and a family
and loving homes they never knew
because we know
deep in our hearts
that they are all our children too

these are souls in need
they need us to give
someone has to pay
for their chance to live
help me try

CHORUS
they're called bui-doi
the dust of life
conceived in hell

JOHN AND CHORUS
and born in strife
they are the living reminders
of all the good we failed to do

CHORUS JOHN
that's why we know that's why we know
deep in our hearts deep in our hearts

CHORUS
that's why we know

JOHN
that they are all our children...

JOHN AND CHORUS
...too
