It's 2gether, whoa 
Ooohhh it's 2gether, whoa 

Number 2-G-E-T-H-E-R 
to the CD you play in you car 
Drive to, cry to, blow that star 
Tiger Woods is 10 strokes under par 
So tell me how far you could get 
at the superstar sideshow that ain't it 
Don't throw no fit 
just ride on the energy 
it's 2gether from now until infinity. 

We are 5, we are 5 
2gether, 2gether 
We do our thang baby 
and sing 
5gether

See all the girls with their hands in the air. 
You can tell by the screams this ain't Lilith Fair 
We in a world now 2G's dragon lair 
and we'll take off our shirts if ya double dog dare 
Splitting my pants as I sit in the chair 
Revenge of the nerds 
Funny Hollywood square! 
Tripping, skipping, tobaloo hoo 
choo choo's coming through 
fast on the train track.

Yeah yeah rubba dub dub 
sweet love in the tub 
We're here to hug 
Kiss and give you back rubs 
had to scratch our way up from down in the mud 
we weren't discovered in no Mickey Mouse club 
Playing our dub. 
Looking for a deal 
we're too for real with 5 on the bill 
5 on the court, championship 
Just can't eat one of these potato chips 
Yea yea yea, its just the flavor hits 
as it bumps your hips 
Through the eye of an eagle 
we need no playa hating people 
Sequel, equal to none 
2gether, Masterpiece, job's done 

If there's gonna be 5 of us why not call us 5gether! Ah ah
