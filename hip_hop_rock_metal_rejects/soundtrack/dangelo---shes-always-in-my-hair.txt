Whenever I feel like givin' up  
Whenever my sunshine turns 2 rain  
Whenever my hopes and dreams are aimed in the wrong direction  
She's always there tellin' me how much she cares  
She's always in my hair  
She's always in my hair, my hair  
Whenever I feel like not 2 great at all  
Whenever I'm all alone  
Even if I hit the wrong notes  
She's always in my boat  
She's always there tellin' me how much she cares  
She's always in my hair  
She's always in my hair, my hair  
Maybe I'll marry her  
Maybe I'll marry her, maybe I won't  
Maybe I will not  
Let me tell U, baby Even if I was a gigolo all my life  
If I was a gigolo all my life  
She'd still be there tellin' me just how much she really cares  
She cares  
She's always in my hair  
She's always in my hair, my hair  
Yeah  
Listen...  
Whenever I feel like givin' up  
Whenever my sunshine turns 2 rain  
Whenever my hopes and dreams are aimed in the wrong direction  
She's always there tellin' me just how much she cares  
Tellin' me how much she cares  
Tell me, baby  
Always in my hair  
She's always in my hair, my hair  
She's always in my hair {repeat 2 fade}
