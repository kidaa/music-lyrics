Friends forever we stay together, we keep it true
You for me, and me for you, we are the crew
Come along and sing this song, y'all, where you're at
What you need, don't worry about it, I got your back
We're one and the same, the same chain, the same gang
It's all love we share joy and share pain
From the heart we never part, we never bend
I'll be there for you, we're friends til the end

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for you too
I'll be there for you
I will be there for you
Cause I know you'll be there for me too
I'll be there for you
Cause I know you'll be there for me too
I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me too

How you doin'
Let me know something
At the end of the week, I'll let you know something
You'll get it soon as I get it fair
And now I'm goin'
You think it's funny, with your money
I'm breaking ???

And tell your sister I'm missin' her
You know I'm kiddin'
I gotta give her her keys and tell me where she's livin'
And don't hack it
I'm gonna leave and take your jacket
I'm feelin' a chill outside and I'm gonna take it I have to match it
Let me borrow your car, my Jaguar's broke
I don't even have to ask, I'm gonna leave a note
Thanks a lot, you're the best friend a guy can have
You tell jokes, I'm paying you back don't make me laugh

You, man, are cool from old school to new school
Mess with the girls and shoot hoops and shoot pool
You are my man, we never part, we never bend
I'll be there for you, we'll be friends til the end

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for me too
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you 

Hello, children, it's me again
You got nuttin', to loan me, it's ???
Don't hide it, abide, come on, share alike
I brought a new pair of gloves so I could steer your bike
I see Stevie, came up to me, acting greedy
I say I'll be true, say you didn't see me

Well, it's me and you, me and you, we are the crew
It's us against the world, squirrel, it's nuttin' new

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for me too
