easy like sunday morning, like an angel callin he's taking me all in, 
im embracing him with my skin, like a pillar of light a vision 
of light and he's so perfect that i couldnt picture him if i tried, 
see some may come some may go but i'll but i'll follow you
 where ever you go your the perfect mate for my soul and 
i know why i lose control, i lose control whenever im around you, yea 

CHORUS
cause you've given me your hand and thats 
more than enough your glance is like jumpin in the river of jordan 
purify me baby, when im taking your hand and thats more than enough 
your glance is like jumpin in the river of jordan purify me baby. 

its like summer time always like its sunny out all day,
when ever you smile sweeter than momma's homemade 
i thought every man was made the same way, 
but in a world of smoke and ashes boy you are 
milk and honey see some may come and some 
may go just fill me up with your love you're nourishment
to my soul and i know why i lose control, i lose control
whenever im around you cause you've given me 

CHORUS
your hand and thats more than enough 
your glance is like jumpin in the river of jordan purify 
me baby when im takin your hand and thats more 
than enough your glance is like jumpin in the river of
jordan purify me baby
