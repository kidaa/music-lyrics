I circle out all the things you said, 
Searchlights off, I'm lost in you again,

I'm on the fly, waiting to be found,
Say your goodbye's let my heart out
You don't have the time,
So I guess this means goodbye.

As hard as this could be,
I would give you everything,
And if space is what you need,
Well there's, room inside of me,
So run as fast as you will,
Baby I will, be here waiting,
To catch the tears that have spilt,
Or just hear how you are feeling,

You pick it up first, always of mine,
Saturated love is destined to pass by,
I watch you cast eye to everyone's but mine,
Now I know that it's time, time to say goodbye.

As hard as this could be,
I would give you everything,
And if space is what you need,
Well there's, room inside of me,
So run as fast as you will,
Baby I will, be here waiting,
To catch the tears that have spilt,
Or just hear how you are feeling,

Everything

As hard as this could be,
I would give you everything,
And if space is what you need,
Well there's, room inside of me,

As hard as this could be,
I would give you everything,
And if space is what you need,
Well there's, room inside of me,

So run as fast as you will,
Baby I will, be here waiting,
To catch the tears that have spilt,
Or just hear how you are feeling,

You're everything, everything, you are everything
