Dream
As long as you know 
It's not impossible 
To make it a reality 

Oh dreams 
Are always there for you 
And always there for me 
To reach as long as you and I believe 

I'm not just telling you 
All of our dreams come true 
As long as you just remember that I believe 

Anything that I can do 
I know that you can too 
Don't you let anyone ever keep you from your dreams 

You can do whatever you want 
Don't ever turn away from your heart 

So make a wish on heaven 
The stars will send you in the right direction 
As long as you believe 

Dream
As long as you know 
It's not impossible 
To make it a reality 

Oh dreams 
Are always there for you 
And always there for me 
To reach as long as you and I believe 

Don't ever think you can't 
Don't ever think you have 
Don't ever reach the future that you have left 

Don't ever say there's no hope for you tomorrow 
When you control the dreams that you've always known 

You can do whatever you want 
Don't ever turn away from your heart 

So make a wish on heaven 
The stars will send you in the right direction 
As long as you believe 

Dream
As long as you know 
It's not impossible 
To make it a reality 

Oh dreams 
Are always there for you 
And always there for me 
To reach as long as you and I believe 

There's no better place than where you are 
To reach for the sky 
You'll have the stars 
Whatever you want is available 
Just don't be afraid to dream 

Dream
As long as you know 
It's not impossible
To make it a reality 
You can make your dreams come true 

Oh dreams 
Are always there for you 
And always there for me 
To reach as long as you and I believe

Only you can dream you know 
Eventually it will come to you 
Anything you want if you believe 
That you can have the stars, the moon 

Only you can dream you know 
Eventually it will come to you 
Anything you want if you believe
That you can have the stars, the moon 

Dream
As long as you know 
It's not impossible
To make it a reality 

Oh dreams 
Are always there for you 
And always there for me 
To reach as long as you and I believe

It's not impossible
To make it a reality
