She's got me stolen 
So you wonder why 
Man I was rollin' 
She has all I got 

Feel too good 
What can you do? 
Can't seen to control myself 
So how can I talk to you? 

Met her in the garden 
Taking the stairway home 
Something hits me harder 
Hits me like a stone 

Feel too good 
What can you do? 
Can't seen to control myself 
So how can I talk to you? 

If it should be questioned 
I can feel the heat 
Mind her reflection 
Stops you in the street 

Feel too good 
What can you do? 
Can't seen to control myself 
So how can I talk to you? 

Feel too good 
What can you do? 
Can't seen to control myself 
So how can I talk to you? 

Feel too good 
What can you do? 
Can't seen to control myself 
So how can I talk to you? 

I feel too good 
Feel too good feel too good 
Yeah hey yeah 
What can you do?
