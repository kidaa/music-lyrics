a crush 
a crush 
a crush 
a crush 
It's just it's just 
a little crush a little crush a little crush a little crush 
a crush 
It's just it's just 
some little thing some little thing little thing little thing little thing 
a crush 

Seein' you and me 
I guess it doesn't take a scientist 
to understand whats going on baby 
If you see something in my eye 
Let's not over analyze 
Don't go too deep with it baby baby 

So let it be 
what it'll be 
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me 
Here's what I'll do 
I'll play the wuss, not like we have a date with destiny 
It's just a, a little crush crush 
Not like I faint, every time we touch 
It's just a, some little thing crush 
Not like every thing I do 
Depends on you 

Sha la la la 
Sha la la la 
a crush 
a crush 
a crush 

It's raising my adrenilin' 
You're bankin' on a heart attack 
Please don't make too much of this baby baby 
Say that were for ever more 
That's not what I'm looking for 
All I can commit to is maybe maybe 

So let it be 
What it'll be 
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me 
Here's what I'll do 
I'll play the wuss, not like we have a date with destiny 
oh
It's just a, a little crush crush 
Not like I faint, every time we touch 
It's just a, some little thing crush 
Not like every thing I do 
Depends on you 

yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
every time we touch 
yeah a oh babe crush 
Not like every thing I do 
Depends on you
