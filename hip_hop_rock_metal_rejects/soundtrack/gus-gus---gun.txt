the lyrics

You've got to find yourself a place to stay anyway
'Cause I ain't stayin' around anymore, no way
Now you'd better leave
Cause I'm gonna find
Myself another 

Take that gun blow your mind take that gun
Go ahead and make my day 

You got to find another piece of wax anyway
'Cause I think it's over now it melted down
Just the other day 

Take that gun blow your mind take that gun
Go ahead and make my day
Take that gun blow your mind take that gun
