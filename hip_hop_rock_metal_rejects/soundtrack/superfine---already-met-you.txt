The first date's the worst date 
It's hard to know just what to do 
And I take you to dinner 
You don't eat, you just play with your food 
And there's something familiar 
About every word you say 
It's hard to believe it's happening again 

I already met you 
And I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

I take you to my apartment 
And then it's just south of Beirut 
And you tell me you're bored 
And you don't like the color of my shoes 
And the picture gets clearer with every word you say 
It's hard to believe it's happening again 

I already met you 
And I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

Don't mean to upset you 
I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

Two points two kids and a house on the hill 
A dog named BOO and sweet Uncle Phil...Fella? 

My head says you're different 
You're the one with whom I should grow old 
Yeah, that's not toconvicing 
When you're yelling at your dad on my phone 
So I stare out the window 
And I find me a simle 'Cause I still believe it gets better than this 

I already met you 
And I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

Don't mean to upset you 
I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 
And the girlfriend I had before her 
And the girlfriend I had before her 
And the girlfriend I had before that.
