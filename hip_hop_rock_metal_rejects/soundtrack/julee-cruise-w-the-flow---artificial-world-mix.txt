Artificial world 
Artificial soul 
Artificial place 
Ordinary lights 

In this artificial world, 
It's an artificial world...

It's an ordinary time
It's no ordinary day 
With your systematic time 
In your agomatic way 

In this artificial world, 
It's an artificial world... 

Tell me, 
How can I believe when I believe? 
Can I believe when I believe? 

He's a syndicated man 
With a cybernetic life 
With an infoponic soul 
With his crucifying kind 

In this artificial world, 
It's an artificial world... 

Tell me, 
How can I believe when I believe?
Can I believe when I believe? 

Why can't I believe... 
Why can't I believe... 
Why can't I believe -- in -- you? 

I'm an artificial girl 
Singing overpolished songs 
In my stimulated voice 
Weeping artificial tears 

In my artificial world, 
It's an artificial world... 

Tell me, 
How can I survive when love's not here? 
Can I survive if love's not here?
