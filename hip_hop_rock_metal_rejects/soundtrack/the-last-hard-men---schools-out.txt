Written by: Alice Cooper and Michael Bruce


No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
School's out with fever

Out for summer
Out for fall
We might not come back at all
School's out completely

[Chorus]
School's out for summer 
School's out for forever
School's out with flavor
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books 
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out for fall
We might not come back at all

[Chorus]
