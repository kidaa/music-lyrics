I told Althea I was feeling lost 
Lacking in some direction 
Althea told me upon scrutiny 
my back might need protection 

I told Althea that treachery 
was tearin me limb from limb 
Althea told me: now cool down boy - 
settle back easy Jim 

You may be Saturday's child all grown 
moving with a pinch of grace 
You may be a clown in the burying ground 
or just another pretty face 
You may be the fate of Ophelia 
sleeping and perchance to dream - 
honest to the point of recklessness 
self centered to the extreme 

Ain't nobody messin with you but you 
your friends are getting most concerned - 
loose with the truth 
maybe it's your fire 
but baby...don't get burned 
When the smoke has cleared, she said, 
that's what she said to me: 
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head 
and a little sympathy 

There are things you can replace 
and others you cannot 
The time has come to weigh those things 
this space is getting hot - 
you know this space is getting hot 

I told Althea 
I'm a roving sign - 
that I was born to be a bachelor - 
Althea told me: Ok that's fine - 
So now I'm out trying to catch her 

Can't talk to me without talking to you 
We're guilty of the same old thing 
Talking a lot about less and less 
And forgetting the love we bring
