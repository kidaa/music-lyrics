MR MACKEY
There are times when you get suckered in
By drugs and alcohol and sex with women mmkay
But it's when you do these things too much 
That you become an addict and must get back in touch


You can do it, it's all up to you, mmmkaaaaay.
With a little plan you can change your life today!
You don't have to spend your life addicted to smack
Homeless on the streets giving hand jobs for crack.
Follow my plan and very soon you will say
It's easy, mmmkay

Step 1 instead of 'ass' say 'buns'
Like kiss my 'buns' or your're a 'buns' hole

Step 2 instead of 'shit' say 'poo'
As in bull 'poo', 'poo' head, and this 'poo' is cold


Step 3 with bitch drop the T
Because 'bich' is Latin for generosity

Step 4 don't say 'fuck' anymore 
Because 'fuck' is the worst word that you can say
So just use the word 'mmmkay'!

KIDS AND MR MACKEY
We can do it, it's all up to us, mmmkay
With a little plan we can change our lives today!
We don't have to spend our lives shootin' up in the trash
Homeless on the streets doing handjobs for cash
Follow this plan and very soon you will say
It's easy, mmmkay.

Step 1 instead of 'ass' say 'buns'
Like kiss my 'buns' or your're a 'buns' hole

Step 2 instead of 'shit' say 'poo'
As in bull 'poo', 'poo' head, and this 'poo' is cold


Step 3 with bitch drop the T
Because 'bich' is Latin for generosity

Step 4 don't say 'fuck' anymore 
Because 'fuck' is the worst word that you can say
Fuck is the worst word that you can say!
Fuck is the worst word that you can say!
You souldn't say fuck, no we shouldn't say fuck
Fuck fuck no!

We don't have to spend our lives shootin' up in the trash
Homeless on the streets doing handjobs for cash
Follow this plan and very soon you will say
It's easy, mmmkay.
