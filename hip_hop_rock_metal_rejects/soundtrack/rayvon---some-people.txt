the lyrics

Some people like walkin in the rain 
Some people like to get way on a plane 
Some people like to party every night, 
But all I wanna do 
Is baby stay home with you 

Some poeple like chillin at the beach 
Some people they don't practice what they preach 
Some people like cruisin in their cars 
But all I wanna do 
is baby stay home with you 

All I really wanna do 
On days I'm with out you without you 
You still linger on my mind 
There is no substitution 
You are where I wanna spend my time 
Baby 

Some people like workin day n night 
Some people they are lookin for a fight 
Some people they just dream there life away
But baby all I wanna do is baby stay home with you 

All I really wanna do 
On days im without you without you 
You still linger on my mind 
There is no substitution no 
You are where I wanna spend my time 

Some people they like workin day n night 
Some people are lookin for a fight 
Some poeple they like to dream there life away 
But all I wanna do 
Is baby stay home with you
