Woody's Roundup
Right here every day
Woody's Roundup
come on, it's time to play
There's Jessie, the yodeling cowgirl
yo-de-la, you-de-la, yo-de-la
Bullseye, he's woody's horse
grrr...he's a smart one
Pete the old prospector
and Woody the man himself
of course
It's time for Woody's Roundup
He's the very best
He's the rootinest tootinest cowboy
in the wild wild west

Woody's Roundup
Come on, gather round
Woody's Roundup
Where nobody wears a frown
Bad guys go running
Whenever he's in town
He's the rootinest, tootinest, shootinest, hootinest cowboy around
Woody's Roundup
