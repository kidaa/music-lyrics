Girl The Way You Do Me...
Yeah
Ohhh...
Girl The Way You Do Me

Girl My Head's On Fire
Since Our Very First Kiss
Dreamed Of Us Together
Never dreamed of this
Took me up to your room
To show me who you are
My cup is running over
Maybe it's your... bra?

Girl The Way You Do Me
Makes Me Say Waz Up Waz Up
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor...
Feelin Down, Feelin Up
Girl The Way You Do Me
Drivin Me Insane
I've never felt this way before...

I'll tell you how I'm feelin
There's no way to begin
Like winnin' half a million
And then kissing through
Girl I know you're moody
You blow hot and cold
That's the way I Like It
You're What I Want What I Want

Girl The Way You Do Me
Makes Me Say Waz Up Waz Up
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor...
Feelin Down, Feelin Up
Girl The Way You Do Me
Drivin Me Insane
I've never felt this way before...

Girl The Way You Do Me
Makes Me Say Waz Up Waz Up
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor...
Feelin Down, Feelin Up
Girl The Way You Do Me
Drivin Me Insane
I've never felt this way before...

I'll Paris Blues and Gap You
Can't Wait To Unwrap You
You know I am feelin' you,
Are you feeling me?

If you didn't phone me
I see the sky turning black
I wish my mom would loan me
A Couple Of Prozac
But I won't let it get to me
I know you just forgot
Cause, girl you're always with me
Even Even When When You're Not

Girl The Way You Do Me
Makes Me Say Waz Up Waz Up
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor...
Feelin Down, Feelin Up
Girl The Way You Do Me
Drivin Me Insane
I've never felt this way before...
