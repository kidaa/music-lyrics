Verse 1 
It's all in her eyes 
you and me 
Words just disguise 
all the things that you be 

What is deep 
it's deeper than deep 
So only it knows 
this kind of vibe 
gets stronger in time 

Won't go on unnoticed 
So concrete can't hold this 
Hearts filled righteously 

Whatever it is 
I know that it's real 
Long as you know 
No complaints 
you're all that I feel 

CHORUS 
Si-sta-soul 
You must be my soulsista, soulsista 
Si-sta-soul 
Hey sis, you must be my soulsista, soulsista 
Si-sta-soul 
Hey sis, you must be my soulsistaaa 
Si-sta-soul 


Verse 2 
You are so fine 
Like spaces that fall in my soul 
See baby that has no rhyme 
Do you like how it feels 
when I smoke you out 
head down to your toes 
Making you scream and shout 
You must be my soulsista, soulsista 

CHORUS 
Si-sta-soul X6 

Music...

Can I love you in the right way Way

You know baby I want to 
LOVE 
In the right way

Cause you're my

All I wanna do is 
LOVE
