There's a town down the road
Where I ain't been before
Nobody knows my name
Or what I'm lookin for 

Maybe things will be a little different
'Cause they can't stay the same
I'm gonna ease on down the road
Where nobody knows my name 

I've got to keep the dust a' movin'
Up around my heels
There might be a change for me
Just over that distant field 

Even when the past comes callin
Lookin for somebody to blame
I'll be easin on down the road
Where nobody knows my name 

When the burnin sun surrenders
Will he still remember me
I never told him I was goin
Out where the wind is blowin free 

If he thinks about me tonight
I know he won't miss the pain
Cause I'll be takin it down the road
Where nobody knows my name 

When the burnin sun surrenders
Will he still remember me
I never told him I was goin
Out where the wind is blowin free 

If he thinks about me tonight
I know he won't miss the pain
I'll be takin it down the road
Where nobody knows my name 

I'm gonna ease on down the road
Where nobody knows my name
