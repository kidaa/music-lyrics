I've been cheated by you since I don't know when 
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end 
Look at me now, will I ever learn? 
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control 
There's a fire within my soul 
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring 
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh 

Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed you 
Yes, I've been brokenhearted 
Blue since the day we parted 
Why, why did I ever let you go? 
Mamma mia, now I really know, 
My my, I could never let you go. 

I've been angry and sad about the things that you do 
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through 
And when you go, when you slam the door 
I think you know that you won't be away too long 
You know that I'm not that strong. 
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring 
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh 

Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed ya 
just how much I've missed ya 
just how much I've missed ya 
just how much I've missed ya 
just how much I've missed ya 

mama mia 
mama mia 
mama mia, mia, mia 

Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed ya 
Mamma mia, even if I say 
Bye bye, leave me now or never 
mamma mia, it's a game we play 
Bye bye doesn't mean forever 

Yes, I've been brokenhearted 
Blue since the day we parted 
Why, why did I ever let you go? 
Mamma mia, now I really know 
My my, I could never let you go 

Mamma mia, here I go again 
My my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again? 
My my, just how much I've missed you 
just how much I've missed ya 
missed ya 
just how much I've missed ya 
missed ya 
missed ya 
missed ya 
missed ya 
missed ya
