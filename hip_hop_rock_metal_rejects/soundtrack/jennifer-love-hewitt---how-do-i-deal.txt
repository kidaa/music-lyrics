Every day I wake up to another day gone by 
Nothing but the open road and the never-ending why 
Anything can happen, yeah, but nothin ever does 
I try to change, it's kinda strange, the same as it ever was, but look at us 

How do I deal with you 
How do I deal with me 
When I don't even know myself 
Or what it is you want from me 
How do I deal with us 
How do I know what's real 
When I don't even trust myself 
Or what it is I feel 
And how do I deal 

Every night, in the dark, I lie awake in bed 
How am I supposed to dream, with all the static in my head 
I turn in all directions and I pray for some relief 
What can I do but feel the weight I'm underneath 
And grit my teeth 

How do I deal with you 
How do I deal with me 
When I don't even know myself 
Or what it is you want from me 
How do I deal with love 
Why do I Why do I have to choose 
And everybody's tellin me 
What the hell I have to do 
And how do I deal with us 
How do I know what's real Real 
When I don't even trust myself 
Or what it is I feel 
Now how do I deal 

How do I deal with you How do I deal with you 
How do I deal with me 
When I don't even know myself 
Or what it is you want from me 
How do I deal with love How do I deal 
Why do I have to choose 
When everybody's tellin me 
What the hell I have to do 
How do I deal with you How do I deal with you 
How do I deal with me How do I deal with me 
When I don't even know myself 
Or what it is you want from me 
How do I deal with us How do I know what's real 
How do I know what's real 
When I don't even trust myself 
Or what it is I feel 

How do I deal How do I deal, yeah
