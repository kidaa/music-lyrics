I can go on my own way 
If you believe the story 
She was a secretary 
Worked for some dignatary 
Stuck at her desk the whole day 
'Cept for the trips for coffee 
? 
In the shadow of a bad year 
? 
Looking far away from here 
He felt so ordinary 
Worked for this big attorney 
Kept on his head phones all day 
Tuning into sixties airwaves 
Out on a lunch on the parkway 
Was where they met each other one day 
And what they found 
Took them far away from here 
And what they found 
Took them so far away
