Her heart bleeds 
It is a basis for your heartfelt hunger 
So gaze at the page at the faces of nameless... 
You're alone again 
And this distortion is an apt replacement for an unquenchable desire for more 
More pages strewn across this sickening floor 
I can't look at any of this 
If they saw what those eyes have seen 
Oh how her heart it would bleed 
If she only knew those abusive roots 
And how the children would weep 
If they only saw what those eyes have seen 
It always keeps us longer than we wanted to stay 
It always takes us further than we wanted to go 
But you don't seem to mind at the time 
Begging to be set free...from what we were meant to be 
Innocence 
It's inside you and your soul is longing, yearning 
Pleading to be set free 
Within your eyes, within my eyes, within our eyes 
There could never be a more complete perversion of what we were meant to be 
And with all that is in me I hate this 
As we're sinking inside this ever-feeding illness 
We are all quite silent 
Sitting still
