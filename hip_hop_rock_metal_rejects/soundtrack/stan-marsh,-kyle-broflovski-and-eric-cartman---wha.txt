What would Brian Boitano do
If he was here right now?
He'd make a plan and he'd follow through
That's what Brian Boitano do.

KYLE
When Brian Boitano was in the Olympics 
Skating for the gold
He did two sowcows and a triple lutz
Wearing a blind fold

CARTMAN
When Brian Boitano was in the Alps
Fighting grizzly bears
He used his magical fire breath
And saved the maiden's fair

ALL
So what would Brian Boitano do
If he were here today
I'm sure he'd kick and ass or two
That's what Brian Boitano do

CARTMAN
I want this V-chip out of me
It has stunted my vocabulary

And I just want my mom
To stop fighting everyone

STAN
For Wendy I'll be an actavist, too
Cuz that's what Brian Boitano do

H e'd call all the kids in town
And tell them to unite for truth
Cuz that's what Brian Boitano Do

When Brian Boitano traveled through time
To the year 3010
He fought the evil robot kings
To save the human race again

CARTMAN
And when Brian Boitano built the pyramids
He beat up Kublai Khan
Cuz Brian Boitano doesn't take shit from anybody

ALL
So let's put all the pieces together
And unite to stop our moms
And we'll save Terrance and Phillip, too
Cuz that's what Brian Boitano do
