Menken, Ashman 

Belle
Little town, it's a quiet village 
Ev'ry day like the one before 
Little town full of little people 
Waking up to say... 

Townsfolk
Bonjour
Bonjour
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! 

Belle
There goes the baker with his tray, like always 
The same old bread and rolls to sell 
Ev'ry morning just the same 
Since the morning that we came 
To this poor provincial town... 

Baker
"Good Morning, Belle!" 

Belle
"Morning, Monsieur." 

Baker
"Where are you off to?" 

Belle
"The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story about a beanstalk and an ogre and a..." 

Baker
"That's nice. Marie! The baguettes! Hurry up!" 

Townsfolk
Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question 
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell? 
Never part of any crowd 
'Cause her head's up on some cloud 
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle 

Bonjour Good day 
How is your fam'ly? 
Bonjour Good day 
How is your wife? 
I need six eggs 
That's too expensive 

Belle
There must be more than this provincial life 

Bookseller
"Ah, Belle." 

Belle
"Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed." 

Bookseller
"Finished already?" 

Belle
"Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new?" 

Bookseller
"Not since yesterday." 

Belle
"That's all right. I'll borrow... this one" 

Bookseller
"That one? But you've read it twice!" 

Belle
"Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise..." 

Bookseller
"If you like it all that much, it's yours!" 

Belle
"But sir..." 

Bookseller
"I insist." 

Belle
"Well, thank you. Thank you very much!" 

Townsfolk
Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar 
I wonder if she's feeling well 
With a dreamy far-off look 
And her nose stuck in a book 
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle 

Belle
Oh, isn't this amazing? 
It's my fav'rite part because you'll see 
Here's where she meets Prince Charming 
But she won't discover that it's him 
'Til chapter three 

Townsfolk
Now it's no wonder that her name means "beauty" 
Her looks have got no parallel 
But behind that fair facade 
I'm afraid she's rather odd 
Very diff'rent from the rest of us 
She's nothing like the rest of us 
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle 

LeFou
"I got it! Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston! You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!" 

Gaston
"I know." 

LeFou
"No beast alive stands a chance against you. And no girl, for that matter." 

Gaston
"It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one." 

LeFou
"Huh? The inventor's daughter?" 

Gaston
"She's the one... The lucky girl I'm going to marry." 

LeFou
"But she's..." 

Gaston
"The most beautiful girl in town." 

LeFou
"I know, but..." 

Gaston
"That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best?" 

LeFou
"Well, of course! I mean you do, but..." 

Gaston
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her 
I said she's gorgeous and I fell 
Here in town there's only she 
Who is beautiful as me 
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle 

Girls

Look there he goes 
Isn't he dreamy? 
Monsieur Gaston 
Oh he's so cute 
Be still my heart 
I'm hardly breathing 
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute 

Townsfolk
Bonjour!

Gaston
Pardon...

Townsfolk
Good day! 
Mais oui! 
You call this bacon? 
What lovely grapes! 
Some cheese! 
Ten yards! 
One pound! 

Gaston
'Scuse me! 

Townsfolk
I'll get the knife! 

Gaston
Please let me through! 

Townsfolk
This bread... 
Those fish... 
It's stale! 
They smell! 
Madame's mistaken... 

Belle
There must be more than this provincial life 

Gaston
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife! 

Townsfolk
Look there she goes 
A girl who's strange but special 
A most peculiar mad'moiselle 
It's a pity and a sin 
She doesn't quite fit in 
'Cause she really is a funny girl 
A beauty but a funny girl 
She really is a funny girl 
That Belle!
