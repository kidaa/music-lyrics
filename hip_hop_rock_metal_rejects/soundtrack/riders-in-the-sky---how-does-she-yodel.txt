the lyrics

How does she yodel? "Yodel adee tee!"
When does she yodel? "Yodel adee tee!"
Why does she yodel?
It sure beats me "Yodel adee tee, ee ay dee tee! 
I love to hear little Jessie sing a happy yodeling song
Something make me want to start just yodeling along "Me too"
Way back in my tonsils
something always ends up wrong
Yodel ee dee ay ee dee eeay
"Help us Jessie!" 

How do we yodel? "Yodel adee tee!"
When do we yodel? Any time will do"
Why do we yodel? "I wish I knew"
Boy we do too 

Spoken:
Why it's not so hard, boys. You just gotta
start simple and work your way up to trickier
and trickier yodel 'til you yodel like me -
Jessie, the Yodelin' Cowgirl 

Yodeling 

Say Jessie, how about I try
Well let 'er rip, Ranger Doug 

Yodeling
