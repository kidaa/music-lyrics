Give me your hand, 
Get in the van, 
Do you understand? 
He's got a plan. 

He's got a room for one night, 
So don't try to fight. 
He's got a knife, 
No respect for your life. 

Is it for real? 
How does it feel? 
We made a deal. 
Even paid for your meal. 

She's got a pain in her head. 
Her eyes are red. 
Touch her again and you're dead. 
You heard what she said. 

I am a heroine. 
He tried to do her in. 
I gave it back to him. 
He won't do it again. 

I'm a heroine. 
He tried to do her in. 
I gave it back to him. 
He won't do it again. 

Give me your hand 
Get in the van, 
Do you understand? 
Act like a man. 

He got a room for one night, 
So don't try to fight.

Touch her again and you're dead. 
You heard what I said.

Don't try to run. 
You did what you done. 
I've got a gun, 
And no mercy for scum. 

You're gonna rot in the ground, 
not come back around. 
You pushed yourself down, 
and outta my town. 

I'm a heroine. 
He tried to do her in. 
I gave it back to him. 
He won't do it again.
