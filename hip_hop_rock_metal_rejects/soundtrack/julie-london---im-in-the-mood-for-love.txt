Lyrics : Dorothy Fields, Music: J McHugh 

I'm In The Mood For Love 
Simply because you're near me. 
Funny, but when you're near me 
I'm In The Mood For Love. 

Heaven is in your eyes 
Bright as the stars we're under 
Oh! Is it any wonder 
I'm In The Mood For Love? 

Why stop to think of whether 
This little dream might fade? 
We've put our hearts together 
Now we are one, I'm not afraid! 

If there's a cloud above 
If it should rain we'll let it 
But for tonight, forget it! 
I'm In The Mood For Love.
