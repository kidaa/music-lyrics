One, two, hey! 
I'm headin' off on a digital trip and that's what I plan to do 
I'm goin' away to a digital plane and I ain't comin' back real soon 
The whole thing is electrical 
It's running through my veins 
And everything's connectable 
Hey! Digital 
Hey! Digital 
Whoa 
One, two, three! 
Hey! 

I'm going digital 
Completely digital 
Now I'm invincible 
Let's all get digital 

I stand around at the digital land and no matter what I see 
Everything is comin' at me in a digital reality 
The whole thing's technological 
It's taking me inside 
A World Wide Web collectable 
Hey! Digital 
Hey! Digital 
Whoa 
Ah! 

It's a digital 
I'm going digital 
It's my digital 
It's my digital world 
World 
World 
World 

The whole thing's interchangable 
A-wired up to my mind 
Where anything is capable 
Hey! Digital 
Hey! Digital 
Whoa 
Ah! 

I'm going digital 
Completely digital 
Now I'm invincible 
Let's all get digital
