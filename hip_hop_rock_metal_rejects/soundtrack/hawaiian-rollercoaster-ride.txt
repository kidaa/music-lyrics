Aloha e, aloha e!
Aloha e, aloha e!

`Ano`ai ke aloha e!
`Ano`ai ke aloha e!

There's no place I'd rather be,
Than on my surfboard out at sea,
Lingering in the ocean blue,
And if I had one wish come true,
I'd surf 'til the sun sets beyond the horizon...

`Awikiwiki, mai lohilohi,
Lawe mai i ko papa he`e nalu.


Flying by on a Hawaiian roller coaster ride!

`Awikiwiki, mai lohilohi,
Lawe mai i ko papa he`e nalu,
Pi`i na nalu, la lahalaha,
`O ka moana, hanupanupa,
Lalala i ka la hanahana,
Me ke kai hoene i ka pu`e one,
Helehele mai kakou e!

Hawaiian roller coaster ride!

There's no place I'd rather be,
Than on the seashore dry, wet free,
On golden sand is where I'd lay,
And if I only had my way,
I'd play 'til the sun sets beyond the horizon...

Lalala i ka la hanahana,
Me ke kai hoene i ka pu`e one.

It's time to try the Hawaiian roller coaster ride!

Hang loose, hang ten, howzit, shake a shaka,
No worry, no fear, ain't no biggy brahda,
Cuttin in, cuttin up, cuttin back, cuttin out,
Frontside, backside, goofy footed, wipe out,
Let's get jumpin, surfs up and pumpin,
Coastin with the motion of the ocean,
Whirlpools swirling, cascading, twirling 
Hawaiian roller coaster ride!

There's no place I'd rather be,
Than on my surfboard out at sea,
Lingering in the ocean blue,
And if I had one wish come true,
I'd surf 'til the sun sets beyond the horizon...

`Awikiwiki, mai lohilohi
Lawe mai i ko papa he`e nalu.
