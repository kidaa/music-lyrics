[Spoken]
Oh but it's very exciting, when you're young at your first dance,
and you're sitting on a small quilt chair with your eyes lowered,
terrified that you'd be a wallflower. And suddenly you see two 
black shoes, a white waistcoat, a face, it speakes... 

Anna
[Sung]
We've just been introduced,
I do not know you well,
But when the music started
Something drew me to your side.
So many men and girls,
Are in each others arms-
It made me think we might be
Similarly occupied.
Shall we dance?
On a bright cloud of music shall we fly?
Shall we dance?
Shall we then say "Goodnight and mean "Goodbye"?
Or perchance,
When the last little star has left the sky,
Shall we still be together
With are arms around each other
And shall you be my new romance?
On the clear understanding
That this kind of thing can happen,
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance? Shall we Dance?

[Dialog]
Anna
Mm mm mm...
Mm mm mm...

King
Why'd you stop? You dance pretty , go on, go on, go on!

Anna
Oh your Majesty I didn't realize, after all I'm not a 
Dancing girl...In England no woman would dance while a
Man is looking at her...

King
But you will dance with strange men, holding hands, etcetera. 

Anna
Yes, but not always a stranger. Usually a very good friend.

King
Good, then we will dance together! You show me. 
Teach, teach, teach!

Anna
Well, it's quite simple, the polka. You count one, two, three
and one, two, three and one, two, three...

Shall we dance?

King
One, two, three and?

Anna
On a bright cloud of music shall we fly?

King
One, two, three and?

Anna
Shall we dance?

King
One, two, three and?

Anna
Shall we then say "Goodnight and mean "Goodbye"?

King
One, two, three and?

Anna
Or perchance,
When the last little star has left the sky,
Shall we still be together
With are arms around each other
And shall you be my new romance?
On the clear understanding
That this kind of thing can happen,

Both
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance? Shall we Dance?

Anna
One, two, three and one, two, three and
One, two, three and one, two, three and

King
One, two, three, one, two, three

I know, I know, I forgot "AND" next time
I'll remember!

Both
And one, two, three and one, two, three and
One, two, three and ...

Anna
Oh that's splendid, your Majesty!

King
Splendid! Splendid!

Both
And one, two, three and one, two, three and
One, two, three and ...

King
That is not right!

Anna
Yes, it is! You're doing beautifully, your Majesty.

King
Not the way I see Europeans dance tonight.

Anna
Yes, it was! It was just like that!

King
We're not holding two hands, like this.

Anna
No. As a matter of fact...

King
Or no-o-o-ot like this.

Anna
Yes.

King
Come!
