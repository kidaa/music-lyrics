Nothing suffocates you more than 
the passing of everyday human events
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make 
your children breath into survive

But I'm not a slave to a god 
that doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to world 
that doesn't give a shit

And when we were good 
you just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
we're going to scar your minds

fight, fight, fight, fight

You'll never grow up to be a big-
rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame
They'll just cut our wrists like
cheap coupons and say that death
was on sale today

And when we were good
you just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
we're scar your minds

But I'm not a slave to a god 
that doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to world 
that doesn't give a shit

the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
but death of a million is just a statistic

[CHORUS]

fight, fight, fight, fight
