Yesterday was a million years ago 
In all my past lives I played an asshole 
Now I found you, it's almost too late 
And this earth seems obliviating 
We are trembling in our crutches 
High and dead our skin is glass 
I'm so empty here without 
I crack and split my xerox hands 

I know it's the last day on earth 
We'll be together while the planet dies 
I know it's the last day on earth 
We'll never say goodbye 

The dogs slaughter each other softly 
Love burns it's casualties 
We are damaged provider modules 
Spill the seeds at our children's feet 
I'm so empty here without you 
I know they want me dead 

I know it's the last day on earth
[chorus repeat]
