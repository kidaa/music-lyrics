She's got eyes like Zapruder, a mouth like heroin
She wants me to be perfect like Kennedy
This isn't God, this isn't God, this isn't God, this isn't God
God is just a statistic
God is just a statistic, say show me the dead stars, all of them sing
Hey, hey, hey
This is a riot religious and clean
Hey, hey, hey x2
God is a number you can not count to
You are posthuman and hard
Wired

She's pilgrim and pagan, soft worn and social
In all of her dreams she's a saint like Jackie O

This isn't God, this isn't God, this isn't God, this isn't God
God is just a statistic
God is just a statistic, say show me the dead stars, all of them sing
Hey, hey, hey
This is a riot religious and clean
Hey, hey, hey
Show me the dead stars, all of them sing
Hey, hey, hey
This is a riot religious and clean
Hey, hey, hey
God is a number you can not count to x3
You are posthuman and hard
Wired

All that
Glitters
Is cold
All that glitters is cold
All that
Glitters
Is cold

Say show me the dead stars, all of them sing
Hey, hey, hey
This is a riot religious and clean
Hey, hey, hey
Show me the dead stars, all of them sing
Hey, hey, hey
This is a riot religious and clean
Hey, hey, hey

Ladies and gentleman
