Interview with pogo in Gaston Gazette Dec. 4, '95

D.S.: How much stuff on Revelation #9 is backwards?
Pogo: Well, there are 13 exact tracks on Revelation #9, it consists of 13 tracks 
in which at least 6 are reversed.
D.S.: When we played it backwards, we heard things like  Welcome to the other 
side 
Pogo: Oh yeah, there is all kinds of fan stuff on there, it's playable in any 
direction. It is equally playable in any direction. It has an equal number of 
tracks in each direction.

Forward-Left, Reverse-Right

Are you listening?

Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

We are our own wicked gods
With little  g's  and big dicks
Constantly inflicting a slow demise

Sadistic stick it to my ribs
I'll spread me open
We try to die
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
We run like roaches
I know your poison in our space we'll...lie
To an obscene god we will dance and spit you hear boy?
Don't tell your momma that I brought you here
You're on the other side now
There ain't no going back now
Don't tell your momma that I brought you here boy!
'Cause there ain't no going back
Don't tell your momma that I brought you here stick me to my ribs
'Cause there ain't no going back now
Don't tell your momma that I brought you here we try to die
I'll spread me open 
Are all your infants in abortion cribs?
We run like roaches
I know your poison in our space we'll lie
Don't tell your momma that i brought you here
'Cause there ain't no going back now
Don't tell your momma
Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you tell your mamma!
Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you tell your mamma!
Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you tell your mamma!

Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world
Until on one day they ain't precious and innocent any more
Jesus loves the little children of the world

Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world
Until on one day they ain't precious and innocent any more
Jesus loves the little children of the world

All the Christian soldiers marching in the cold...
Wear the cross of Jesus while marching on and on...

Don't you tell your mamma that I came here and I put this in you!
Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you!

Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world Until on one day 
they ain't precious and innocent any more
Jesus loves the little children of the world

There's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're going or which way the wind is blowing
Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing?
Not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing

Hey Jew, let me thank you for wasting our time! Fuck your time! Asshole!
Fuck your shit, you fucking... Shit! Fucking ho! Fucking ho! Come on, rape her! 
Get her!

Manson has probably killed the pigs without the gang!

Where the fuck's the sausage?
Where the fuck's the sausage?

Every mother...

Hallelujah, motherfucker! Hallelujah!

Goddamn millionaire! Goddamn millionaire!

Son of a bitch!
