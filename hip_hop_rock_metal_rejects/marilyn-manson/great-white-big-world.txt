In space the stars are no nearer 
They just glitter like a morgue 
And I dreamed I was a spaceman 
Burned like a moth in a flame 
And our world was so fucking gone 

But I'm not attached to you now 
Nothing heals and nothing grows 

Because it's a great big white world and we are drained of our colors 
We used to love ourselves, we used to love another 
All my stiches itch 
My prescription's low, I wish you were queen just for today 
In a world so white what else could I say 

And hell was so cold 
All the vases are so broken 
And the roses tear our hands all open 
Mother marry miscarry 
And we pray just like insects 
The world is so ugly now 

Because it's a great big white world and we are drained of our colors 
[chorus repeat]
