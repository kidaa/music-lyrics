They call her
Bulldozer speech demon
Without distractions of hope,
She makes the depression business
Look surprisingly novel.
And she's not just royal,
Allegedly loyal
Not unfaithful but she has no faith in me.
Inhale the damage smoothly
Paradise isn't lost,
It was hiding all along.
There's the ones that you love,
The ones that love you,
The ones that make you come.
The ones that make you come unglued.
I can't turn my back on you
When you are walking away.
Bottomless celebrity scar
Staged circuses for schoolgirls,
Us boys are all dressed up like a
Mediocre suicide omen.
Here comes the red carpet grave
Again and again and again,
Oh man.
There's the ones that you love,
The ones that love you,
The ones that make you come.
The ones that make you come unglued.
I can't turn my back on you,
When you are walking away.
I can't turn my back on you,
When you are walking away.
Can't turn my back on you,
When you are walking away,
When you are walking away.
There's the ones that you love,
The ones that love you,
The ones that make you come.
The ones that make you come unglued.
There's the ones that you love,
The ones that love you,
The ones that make you come.
The ones that make you come unglued.
It's easy to beat the system,
Had a hard time beating the symptoms...
Had a hard time beating the symptoms...
I can't turn my back on you,
Can't turn my back on you,
I can't turn my back on you,
When you are walking away.
Here comes the red carpet grave
Again and again and again.
Here comes the red carpet grave
Again and again and again,
Oh man.
