wrench is just a household god but i carry mine with pride
i dont' worj but i can worj with it to split your smile
run you down without a twitch, your car's just not as big as mine
tear the son out of your bitch and sprinkle your remains with lime
i ain't no working man, i do the best i can, i got the devil's hand
my afternoon's remote control
daydream milk and genocide
tranquility with broken knees, silly putty enemies
butter knife in your side
what i got i got for free, middle finger technology
what's yours is mine, yours is mine, told you fucker, yours is mine
snake eyes for sissies
i ain't no working man, i do the best i can, i got the hdevil's hand
rollin' sixes
i am the habit man, i use up all i can, i got the slacker's hand
i am the pedophile's dream
a messianic peter pan
just a boy, just a boy, just a little fucking boy, i can never be a man
i ain't no working man, i do the best i can, i got the hdevil's hand
rollin' sixes
i am the habit man, i use up all i can, i got the slacker's hand
i ain't no working man, i do the best i can, i got the hdevil's hand
i am the habit man, i use up all i can, i got the slacker's hand
oh no, oh no
