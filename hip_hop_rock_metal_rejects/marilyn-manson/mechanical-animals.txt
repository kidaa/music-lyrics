We were neurophobic and perfect 
the day that we lost our souls 
machines that wished they were human 
If they cry they will rust 
And I was a hand grenade 
That never stopped exploding 
You were automatic and as hollow as the "o" in god 

I am never gonna be the one for you 
I am never gonna save the world from you 
But they'll never be good for you 
Or bad to you 
They'll never be anything 
Anything at all 

You were my mechanical bride 
You were phenobarbidoll 
A manniqueen of depression 
With the face of a dead star 
And I was a hand grenade 
That never stopped exploding 
You were automatic and as hollow as the "o" in god 

I am never gonna be the one for you 
[chorus repeat]

This isn't me I'm not mechanical 
I'm just a boy playing the suicide king
