You have eyes that
Lead me on
And a body that
Shows me death
Your lips look like they were made
For something else but
They just suck my breath
I want your pain
To taste why you're ashamed
And I know you're not just what you say to me
And I'm not the only moment you're made of
You're so sudden and sweet
All legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off
Your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe
And we'll paint
Over the evidence
I want you wanting me
I want what I see in your eyes
So give me something to be scared of
Don't give me something to satisfy
You're so sudden and sweet
All legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off
Your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe
And we'll paint
Over the evidence
I want your pain
To taste why you're ashamed
And I know you're not just what you say to me
And I'm not the only moment you're made of
You're so sudden and sweet
All legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off
Your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe
And we'll paint
Over the evidence
