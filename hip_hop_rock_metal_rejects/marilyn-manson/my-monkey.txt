i had a little monkey
i sent him to the country and i fed him on gingerbread
along came a choo choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo
and now my monkey's dead
at least he looks that way, but then again don't we all
what i make is waht i am, i can't be forever
i had a little monkey
i sent him to the country and i fed him on gingerbread
along came a choo choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo
and now my monkey's dead
poor little monkey
"make you...break you...make you...break you...lookout"
what i make is waht i am, i can't be forever
we are out own wicked gods
with littel "g's" and big dicks
sadistic and constantly inflicting a slwo demise
i sent him to the country and i fed him on gingerbread
along came a choo choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo
and know my monkey's dead
the primate's scream of consonance is a reflection
of his own mind's dissonance
