Some men need some killer weed 
Some men need cocaine 
Some men need some cactus juice, to purify the brain 
Some men need two women, some need alcohol 
Everybody needs a little something
But Lord I need it all 

To get my rocks off 
Get my rocks off 
Get my rocks off the mountain
And roll'em on down the hill 

I may do you one time, and I may do you more 
I may turn you into something, 
That you ain't ready for 
I might want your body
And I might want your bread 
I might want your momma to come visit me instead 

And get my rocks off 
Get my rocks off 
Get my rocks off the mountain, 
And roll'em on down the hill 

Sometimes I dream of chicks
To bring me ever lasting joys 
Sometimes I dream of animals, 
Sometimes I dream of boys 
Sometimes I kill the living
Sometimes I raise the dead 
Sometimes I say just screw it all, 
and crawl back into bed 

And get my rocks off
Get my rocks off 
Get my rocks off the mountain
And roll'em on down the hill
