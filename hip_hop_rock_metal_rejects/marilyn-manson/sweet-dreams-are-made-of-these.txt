Sweet dreams are made of this.
Who am I to disagree
Travel the world and the seven seas.
Everybody's looking for something.

[Chorus:]
Some of them want to use you.
Some of them want to get used by you.
Some of them want to abuse you.
Some of them want to be abused.

[Repeat First Verse]
[Chorus]
I wanna use you and abuse you.
I wanna know what's inside you.
Whispering and Moaning:
Hold your head up, movin' on.
Keep your head up, movin' on.
[Repeat Three Times]
Movin' on!
[Repeat First Verse]
[Chorus]
I'm gonna use you and abuse you.
I'm gonna know what's inside.
Gonna use you and abuse you.
I'm gonna know what's inside you.
