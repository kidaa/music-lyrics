cyclops woman got one eye in her head
mascara-clotted vision she is fed
cyclops woman can't see nothing at all
she got a pin-prick-spiral hols
she can't see nothing, nothing at all
she can't see nothing, nothing at all
cyclops woman dying in her shell
guilt got her trapped in nailed in well
cyclops woman is the eye of the world
who's reflection is the retina
she can't see nothing, nothing at all
she can't see nothing, nothing at all
dialate, dialate
