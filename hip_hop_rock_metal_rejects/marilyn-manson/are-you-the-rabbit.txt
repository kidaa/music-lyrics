I'm a kick stand in your mouth
And I'm the tongue's slamming on the brakes
Pull the choke in
Pull the choke in
As hard as it will take.
All your pictures are getting dirty
I don't want anyone else's
Hand on my gears.
And I'll choke on
All the diamonds,
Like a vulture, on your face

So ask your self before you get in,
I know the insurance won't cover this.
Are you the rabbit
Or the headlight,
And is there
Room in your life
For one more breakdown?

Faster, faster,
Faster-faster-faster,
Faster-faster-faster,
I'm late, I'm late,
I'm late!
And the hands I'm my clock
Are starting to shake.
We're on the line between
The devil's tits,
And we've been driving on E.
I'm going to be wanted for this crime
"Well at least you're wanted,"
She'll say.

So ask your self before you get in,
I know the insurance won't cover this.
Are you the rabbit
Or the headlight,
And is there
Room in your life
For one more breakdown?

You can't escape,
Can't escape
All your demons.
All you demons,
"Watch out, watch out,
For your lovers."

So ask your self before you get in,
I know the insurance won't cover this.
Are you the rabbit
Or the headlight,
And is there
Room in your life
For one more breakdown?

You are an unmarked car
I can't remember where I parked you
But I love you,
Can't afford you,
I'll take a cab to the funeral.
Faster, faster,
Faster-faster-faster,
Faster-faster-faster,
I'm late, I'm late,
I'm late!
And the hands I'm my clock
Are starting to shake.

So ask your self before you get in,
I know the insurance won't cover this.
Are you the rabbit
Or the headlight,
And is there
Room in your life
For one more breakdown?

You can't escape,
Can't escape
All your demons.
All you demons,
"Watch out, watch out,
For your lovers."

So ask your self before you get in,
I know the insurance won't cover this.
Are you the rabbit
Or the headlight,
And is there
Room in your life
For one more breakdown?

Room in your life
For one more breakdown
