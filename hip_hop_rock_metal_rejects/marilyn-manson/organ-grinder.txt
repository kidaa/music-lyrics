i am the face of piss and shit and sugar
i do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey
what i want, what i want is just your children
i hate what i hate become to escape what i hated being
calliopenis envy from your daddy 
you're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear
what i say disgusts him
he wants to be me and that scares him
"let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey"
the black keys
here is my real head, here is my real head
i wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
here is my real head
they try to blink me not to think me
don't want to bring me out
i am the rotten teeth, my fists are lined with suckers
my prison skin's an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad
i am your son
your dad
your fag
i am your fad
here is my real head, here is my real head
i wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me
here is my real head
