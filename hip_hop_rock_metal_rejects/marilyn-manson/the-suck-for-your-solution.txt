Your mouth is like a suicide 
Talkin like you never died 
Automatic charisma 
For your chemical mind 
I'll suffer for you 
I'll suffer for you 
You're kissing me like benzocaine with your sleeping pill eyes 
Melting me down and suck suck sucking my brain 
I'm gonna hate you tomorrow 
Because you make me hate you today 
I'm gonna hate you tomorrow 
Because you make me hate you today 
I can be the one that you believe in 
I can be the liar in your bed 
I'll be the suck for your solution 
Tell me that your sex isn't dead 
Dead 
Your sex is dead 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you since the day I was made 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you since the day I was made 
I am the center of your hate 
I'm gonna be you tomorrow 
Because you make me hate you today 
I can be the one that you believe in 
I can be the liar in your bed 
I'll be the suck for your solution 
Tell me that your sex isn't dead 
Dead 
your sex is dead 
All so tired 
Desexed and jaded 
Hopeless and souless and bored of the thrill 
We make our death/sex/symbol 
When we can't fuck then we kill 
Dead 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you since the day I was made 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you 
I've suffered for you since the day I was made
