She's got here eyes open wide 
She's got the dotten spit of the world 
Her mouth on the metal 
Lips of a scared little girl 
I got a angel in the lobby 
He's waiting to put me in line 
I won't ask forgiveness 
My faith has gone dry 
Shes got christing prescripters 
And death has crawled in her ear 
I kill the faith of the music with songs that 
She shouldn't hear 
And it spins around 
One two three 
And the we all lay down 
Four five six 
Some do it fast and some do it better in smaller amounts 
And it turns around 
One two three 
And we all lay down 
Four five six 
Some do it fast and some do it better in smaller amounts
