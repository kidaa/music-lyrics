They slit
Our throats
Like we were flowers
And our milk
Has been
Devoured
When you want it
Uhuh
Goes away too fast, times you hate it
Uhuh
Always seem to last, just remember
Uhuh
When you think you're free
Free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me
Uhuhuh
And I
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
And I
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

And I wish
I could sleep
But I can't lay on my back
Cause there's a knife
For everyday
That I've known you

When you want it
Uhuh
Goes away too fast, times you hate it
Uhuh
Always seem to last, just remember
Uhuh
When you think you're free
Free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me
Uhuhuh
And I
Wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
And I
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

Lie to me
Cry to me
Give to me
I would
Lie with me
Die with me
Give to me
I would

Keep
All your secrets
Wrapped in dead hair
Always keep
All your secrets
Wrapped in dead hair
Always
Lie to me
Cry to me
Give to me
I would
Lie with me
Die with me
Give to me
I would

Hope
That we die holding hands
x2 Always hope
That we die holding hands x2
