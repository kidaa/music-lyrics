I want to wake up in your white, white sun 
I want to wake up in your world with no pain 
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday 
While you are numb all of the way

When you hate it you know you can feel but 
When you love it you know it's not real 
No 
And I am resigned to this wicked fucking world 
On its way to hell 
The living are dead and 
I hope to join them too 
I know what to do and I di it well...

When you hate it you know you can feel but 
When you love it you know it's not real 
No

Shoot myself to love you 
If I loved myself I'd be shooting you
