The, the, the drugs they say
To make us feel so hollow, we love
In vain, narcissistic and so shallow, the cops and queers, to swim you have to swallow, hate
Today
No love for tomorrow
We're all stars now
In the dope show we're all stars now
In the dope show

There's lots of pretty
Pretty ones
That wanna get you high
But all the pretty
Pretty ones
Will leave you low
And blow your mind

We're all stars now
In the dope show we're all stars now
In the dope show

x2 They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not then they love
Another x2

Drugs they say
Are made in California, we love your face
We'd really like to sell you, the cops and queers make good looking models, I hate
Today, who will I wake up with tomorrow

There's lots of pretty
Pretty ones
That wanna get you high
But all the pretty
Pretty ones
Will leave you low
And blow your mind

x2 They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not then they love
Another x2

There's lots of pretty
Pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty
Pretty ones
Will leave you low
And blow your mind

Blow, blow your mind

We're all stars now
In the dope show we're all stars now
In the dope show
