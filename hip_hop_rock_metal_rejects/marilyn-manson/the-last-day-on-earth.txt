Yesterday was a million years ago, in all my past lives I played an asshole
Now I found you, it's almost too late
And this earth seems obliviating
We are trembling in our crutches
High and dead, our skin is glass
And I'm so empty here without you, I crack my xerox hands
I know it's the last day on earth, we'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on earth, we'll never say goodbye

And the dogs slaughter each other softly
Love burns it's casualties
We are damaged provider modules
Spill the seeds at our children's feet
And I'm so empty here without you
I know they want me dead

I know it's the last day on earth, we'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on earth, we'll never say goodbye

x3 I know it's the last day on earth, we'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on earth, we'll never say goodbye x3
We'll never say goodbye x2
