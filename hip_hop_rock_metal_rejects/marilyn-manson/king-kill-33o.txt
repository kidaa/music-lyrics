Is this what you wanted
This is what you get.
Turned all your lives into this shit.
You never accepted or treated me fair
blame me for what I believe
and I wear.
You fucked yourselves and you 
raised these sheep
the blue and the withered seeds
you will reap.
You never gave me a chance to be me
Or even a fucking chance just to be.
But I have to show you that 
you played a role
and I will destroy you with one simple hole.
The world that hates me has taken its toll 
but now I have finally taken control.
You wanted so bad to make me this thing
and I want you now to just kill the king

and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve
and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve
and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve

King Kill 33
King Kill 33
King Kill 33
