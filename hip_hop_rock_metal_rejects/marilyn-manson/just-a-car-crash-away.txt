She blew me her death-kiss
And the mouth-marks
Bled down my eye,
Like her dying
On my windshield.
I can already feel
Her worms
Eating my spine.
So how can it be this lonely?
Is this all we get
For our lives?
Is love only sweeter when
One of dies?

Then I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away.
I knew that our love was just a car crash away.
I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away.
I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away.

Love is a fire.
Burns down all that it sees.
Burns down everything.
Everything you think
Will burn
Everything you say.

Love is a fire.
Burns down all that it sees.
Burns down everything.
Everything you think
Will burn
Everything you say.

I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away.
Knew that our love was
Just a car crash away.
Just a car crash away.

[backup vocals]
I knew that our love was
Just a
Car
Crash
Away.

I knew that our love was
Just a
Car
Crash
Away.

[repeat to end of solo]

Love is a fire.
Burns down all that it sees.
Burns down everything.
Everything you think
Will burn
Everything you say.

Love is a fire.
Burns down all that it sees.
Burns down everything.
Everything you think
Will burn
Everything you say.
