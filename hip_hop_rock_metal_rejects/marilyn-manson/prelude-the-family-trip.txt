There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're going
Or which way the wind is blowing
Is it raining Is it snowing
Is a hurricane a-blowing
Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Oh, the fires of hell are glowing
Is the grisly reaper mowing
Yes! The danger must be growing Faster! Faster!
For the rowers keep in rowing Faster! Faster!
And they're certainly not showing Faster! Faster!
Any signs that they are slowing Faster! Faster!
Stop the boat.
