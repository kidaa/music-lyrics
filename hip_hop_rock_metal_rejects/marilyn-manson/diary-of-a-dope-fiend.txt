...pitiful fuck
Are you still in love with me, Missi?
I am so pretty and withdrawn

I peek into the hole
I struggle for control
And the children love the show
But they fail to see the anguish in my eyes
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes

I scratch around the brim
I let my mind give in
And the crowd begins to grin
But they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes
It's no surprise

And I know, and I'm coming down

Fail to see the tragic turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy
But we all know the hat is wearing me

My bag is in the hat
It's filled with this and that
And my visions getting fat
The rabbits just a chicken in disguise
Stars and pills and meatballs dance before our eyes
They will bite the hand, if it is slower than
The quickness of there scrutinizing eyes

Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy
But we all know the hat is wearing me
Chicanary will always make you happy
But we all know the hat is wearing me
