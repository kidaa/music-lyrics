They slit our throats 
Like we were flowers 
And our milk has been devoured 

When you want it 
It goes away too fast 
When you hate it 
It always seems to last 
But just remember when you think you're free 
The crack inside you fucking heart is me 

[thought, not spoken:] I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day 

I wish I could sleep 
But I can't lay on my back 
Because ther's a knife 
For everyday that I've known you 

When you want it 
it goes away yoo fast 
When you hate it 
It always seems to last 
But just remember when you think you're free 
The crack inside your fucking heart is me 

[thought, not spoken:] I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day 

Lie to me, cry to me, give to me 
I would 
Lie with me, die with me, give to me 
I would 
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair 
I hope at least we die holding hands for always
