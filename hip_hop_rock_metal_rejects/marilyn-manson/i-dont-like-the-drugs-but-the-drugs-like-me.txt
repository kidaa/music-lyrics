I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
Norm life baby: 
We're white and oh so hetero and 
Our sex is missionary. 
Norm life baby: 
We're quitters and we're sober 
Our confessions will be televised. 
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall 
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all. 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
Norm life baby: 
God is white and unforgiving 
We're piss tested and we're praying. 
Norm life baby: 
I'm just a sample of a soul 
Made to look just like a human being. 
Norm life baby: 
We're rehabbed and we're ready 
For our 15 minutes of shame. 
Norm life baby: 
We're talkshown and we're pointing 
Just like christians at a suicide. 
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall 
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all. 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope 
And we're feeling fine. 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs
