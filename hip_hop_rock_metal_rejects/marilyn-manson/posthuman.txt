She's got eyes like Zapruder 
And a mouth like heroin 
She wants me to be perfect like Kennedy 
This isn't god, this isn't god 
God is just a statistic 
God is just a statistic 
Say "show me the dead stars 
All of them sing." 
This is a riot 
Religious and clean

God is a number you cannot count to 
You are posthuman and hardwired

She's pilgrim and pagan 
Softworn and so-cial 
In all of her dreams 
She's a saint like Jackie O

This isn't god, this isn't god 
God is just a statistic 
[chorus repeat]

[Coma white:]
"All that glitters is cold, all that glitters is cold."
