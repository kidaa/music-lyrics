LIFE THROWS YOU IN LIFE KICKS YOU OUT 
AND THERE AIN'T TIME THINKING ABOUT 
WHAT TO KEEP - WHAT TO THROW 
I'D RATHER SCREAM LOUD AND FIGHT 
THAN TO RUN BACK AND HIDE 
INSIDE A SECRET PLACE 
TIME RUNS FAST AND SO AM I 
IF I STUMBLE I DON'T CRY 
DAILY TERROR FRIGHTENS ME 
AND THERE'S SO MUCH I DIDN'T SEE 
COULDN'T HEAR A THING TODAY 
ALL THOSE WORDS WE OUGHT TO SAY 
ALL THOSE PRAYERS PREACHERS PRAY 
GOD'S NEVER BEEN MY FRIEND 
TIME RUNS FAST AND SO AM I 
IF I STUMBLE I DON'T CRY 
NAKED PEOPLE BLACK AND WHITE 
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE DEEP INSIDE?
