Someone kills someone there's blood in the snow
Guess she was female was she ready to go? 
TV tries to get you higher like if it as your own desire 

Drawn in bad news nothing stays the same 
Evil still wins the good old game 
TV tries to get you higher like if it as your own desire 

It's all o.k. 
Tell me your frightness of today 

Don't you see the need to break away 
Take your chance to end this second hand life today
