I got you in mind 
Memories - unkind 
Always trying to protect you 
From all that shit we went through 
But - time slipped right through our hands 
Crying out didn't make much sense 
Some things I can not change 
I would never do the same 
Some things I can not change 
And I'm not the one to blame 
I turn back time inside my mind 
I call you name reeeetuuuuurrning pain 
All regrets are coming late 
And what I feel I can't explain 
So here I am wasting time 
Hey babe I sill got you in mind
