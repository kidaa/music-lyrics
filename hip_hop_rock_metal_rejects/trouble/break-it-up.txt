I'm turning pages in my head 
Nothing new is coming up - it's all been said 
I can't believe what I still do 
I'm burning out, I'm chasing clouds, I never grow 

Should break it up why can't you see 
Things never ment that much to me 

There's nothing easy I should know 
Getting older like you told me years ago 
Words like "I've seen it all before" 
Just cracks me up don't wanna hear no more 

I'm awfull lost without your love 
Too afraid to I would let my weakness show 
Wish I could change your point of view 
Things would be different and we could do what we do
