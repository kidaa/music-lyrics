All I need is you 
To take me to the good times 
Know that when we're one 
Love will be the lifeline 
Shelter in the storm 
See you in my mind's eye 
'Cause all I need is you 

When we are apart 
Time is hard to measure 
Wish upon a star 
Never saying never 
Walk through any door 
Hostage of a heartbeat 
We'll always be as one 

All I need is you 
Not just illusion 

We can live a lifetime together 
Patterns in the great design 

All I need is you 
To allways live forever 
All I need is you 

I hope you never travel 
A solitary journey 
This life is sharing 
The flame that keeps on burning 
Mend a broken heart 
Sall upon the ocean 
Two hearts that beat as one 

All I need is you 
Not just illusion 
We can live a lifetime together 
Patterns in the great design 

All I need is you 
To always live forever 
All I need is you 

I reach across the distance to touch you 
I hear your voice and everything's right 
You know that I will never forget you 
I couldn't stand the loneliness of living like I do 

All I need is you ...
