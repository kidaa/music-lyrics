I close my eyes and see as it flashed across my screen 
Way to fast for me couldn't grab what I've just seen 
Once again I tried to rewind my memories 
Once again it died inside of me 

Was it something that I couldn't see? 
Was it something that was not for real? 
Was it something that I don't wanna know about? 
Was it anything at all? 

Could I ever bury what I failed to justify 
On a cemetary of a thousand living lies 
Once again I tried to rewind my memories 
Once again it died inside of me
