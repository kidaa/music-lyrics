Wanna know why you stare at me 
It seems like you've never seen a human being 
I'm so special - I am cool 
You're just an idiot who will never break his rules 
If you can't stand the way I am then go away cause I will bring this to an end 

Can't stand the world, I'm staying home 
Just want the rest of you to leave me alone 
I got my telly - my thrills are cheap 
Well this is all I need - yeah this is all! 

I need Do you feel the burning inside your guts 
Does make you leave your home to search anything that hurts 
I tell you all this pain will never go away 
It will be your compagnon any other day 
There ain't no fight to win, no love to proof, no anything 
You won't be better anyway 

You better learn to ignore the tribe 

Can't stand the world 
I'm staying home 
Just want the rest of you to leave me alone 
I got my lessons - I learned em well 
I'm way too tired to fight myself
