It's been more than two weeks that I try to get some sleep 
When all those questions running deep 
The trouble is that I need to concentrate 
Time slips away - it's getting late 
I've been in this about a million times or more
I walked through doors that should have been ignored
I get upset watching you sleep 
I take a deep breath and I start to speak 

Don't tell me what to do cause I know now 

I'm so confused - cannot think straight 
All those decisions waiting to be made 
I run in circles in my spiral soul 
I need some answers - I need control
