I take it out on me while I'm sitting here 
It takes just two words to describe my fear 
With tons of love and a fucking confidence 
It takes just two words and it all makes sense 

I'm telling lies I tried to hide 
I tried to set up things and again I burnt my wings 

Come on down, come on down, just come on down with me 
Well I wanted to be found 
Come on down, come on down, just come on down with me 
I've never been so down 

I am a dead flat broke - get me outta here 
It takes some guts to ride, but you will my dear 
So don't think twice - just think again 
Can't you see I'm fading? I won't appologize!
