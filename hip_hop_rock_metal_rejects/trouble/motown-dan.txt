May I borrow time from you? 
I seem to run out still got a million things to do 
I never thought I could ever be this way 
I'm my own slave and still I'm watching my decay 

Years ago I've been killing time 
Where nothing could affect me 
Cause the world was mine 
I know it was right to change like the wind 
Cause I felt burned out got so tired of it 

Money making is a wonderful thing 
Oh, money making is a wonderful thing 
Why can't that be something inbetween 
Well money making is a wonderful thing 

Why am I so full of doubt? 
The things I do now 
Make me wanna scream and shout 
I never thought I could ever be this way 
I'm my own slave and I'm watching my decay
