Don't need no instincts to please my needs 
I'm living in this system that protects and even feeds 
But conveanience makes greedy and I'm a thankless whore 
I never ever asked for this but now I want some more 

Now it's time to proof the values 
Yes it's time to check some rules 
Cause noone will come to give what I want 
Now it's time to ask for some more! 

All the years of wellfare wouldn't keep me calm 
I saw the clouds of anger growing on 
And the decend piece of luck that I certainly deserve 
Never ever stopped my hunger I got worse and worse 

Now it's time to proof the values 
Sure it's time to check some rules 
Cause I don't want to be in endless misery 
I really need something else 
Yes it's time to kill the values 
Yes it's time to change some rules 
And if noone will come I will take what I want
You can stay where you - stay who you are 
I won't take this anymore!
