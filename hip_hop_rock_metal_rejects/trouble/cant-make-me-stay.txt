I'm steppin in 
Tryin to give it a sin 
Not reachin out 
Just want to say it aloud 
But I don't know why I can't be this way 
I don't know why you can't make me stay 

Yeah, I don't know 

Just kiss and tell 
I might see you in hell 
Don't you wind me up 
Cause I'll be on the top 
But I don't know why I can't be this way 
I don't know why you can't make me stay
