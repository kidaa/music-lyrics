She's tumblin blind, irritated by light 
Attracted to forbidden things 
Cause that's what makes her feel alright 
So there she is off again 
God knows why and god knows when 

Oh so bad and so good 
Killin keepin her alive 
Cause she knows that she should 

She's feeling fine 
So weird in her mind 
Bending down and straighten up 
Guess what she will find 

She's on her way to paradise 
She's made that solemn promise with closed eye
