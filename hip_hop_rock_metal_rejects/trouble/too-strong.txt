Hey would you please wait a minute cause I'm trying to explain 
There is something weird about you what is driving me insane 
Let me try to put things right so you won't ever get me wrong 
Cause I hate this ugly feeling and its getting way too strong 
Why did I wait so long being pushed by things you've done 
Maybe I was waiting for someone to come along 
Someone who would handle all the huzzle that you caused 
Someone else to deal my trouble - someone else but me! 

Don't keep me waiting and don't ask why 
Truth coming up while the sun will rise 
Just leave my life don't say goodbye 
Cause I need to be on fire 

Bang! Here you are! 
And you ask me straight away 
"do you have a sofa, could I stay?" 
Just for the weekend? For another week? For another month? For another life? 
My fridge is empty! 

All the things you thought we had gone in minute ... 
Oh god I'm trying - I never lie!
