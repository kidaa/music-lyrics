Bright awake it all came back
Same film playing on and on inside her head
There's him beating her in full attack
She feels the panic she always gets
Fallen tears she cannot stop
And not to drown she jumps up
Tries to swallow that bitter taste
Had to get things straight wipes her face
Things turn black
Waking up agian
Things turn black
Feeling stuck again
Hears him whisper
I'm right here
Just a dream inside a dream
Was it something he just said
Was it just his mistake
Was there something I could do
I hope it hurt him, too
Was it something I just said
Something he didn't get
Was there something I could do
Does he feel guilty, too
Things turn black
Waking up again
Things turn black
Feeling stuck again
