Last night I wrapped my dreams around you 
Dreamt you were dead and I found you 
I can't understand the reason why 
But I'm glad that it's a lie 

I never got to what you're up to 
But if you're up to what I got to 
Deal along all day and every night 
Just wanted things to turn out right 
But I know where to go 
And I'm sure that life's a bore 

Oh I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - what's coming up 
I'm gonna waste all my time with you 
Oh I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - what's coming up 
I gonna clear it up for you
