Music: Brolycke, Rudolfsson
Lyrics: Karlen

When night slowly spread its blackened wings
and breathe out chilly moist and mist,
I experience an obsession
of evil which I worship

I can feel the night
caress my body with it's beauty,
and the cold dead light
from the moon upon the black sky.
Night is all around me
as I drown in delight.
Oh night, I'm overwhelmed
by thy majestic might.

Under the mighty wings of blackness
I deny my earthly existence.
Embraced by thy nocturnal paradise
I will forever belong to the night.It's time to breathe
the seents of the night.
I opened my veins
to let the night in and I came...

When night slowly spread its blackened wings
and breathe out chilly moist and mist,
I experience an obsession
of evil which I worship

I can feel the night
caress my body with it's beauty,
and the cold dead light
from the moon upon the black sky.
Night is all around me
as I drown in delight.
Oh night, I'm overwhelmed
by thy majestic might.
