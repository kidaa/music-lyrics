Music:Rudolfsson, Brolycke, Andersson Lyrics:Karln

Cold hate, black fear, 
I know the end is here. 
Too near but I have no fear
to die. I really want to die tonight. 
My hate's far stronger than my spiritual winter. 
Deeper than the space, I die, spiritual winter. 
Emerging from the mists of forgotten time. 
The sweet smell of death, a perfume of mesmerizing kind. 
To death, to grave, all is hunger and pain. 
Ascend to deserted space. 
Deaths bells starts to chime tonight. 
In the depth of my destiny, spiritual winter. 
The eyes of my soul dies, spiritual winter.
Emerging from the mists of forgotten time. 
The sweet smell of death, a perfume of mesmerizing kind. 
I'm so tired but I can't sleep anymore. 
I'm still awake but soon asleep. 
My hate far stronger than my spiritual winter. 
Deeper than the space, I die, spiritual winter. 
In the depth of my destiny, spiritual winter 
The eyes of my soul dies, spiritual winter 
Cold hate, black fear, I know the end is here. 
Too near but I have no fear to die. 
I really want to die tonight. 
DIE
