Music:Brolycke, Andersson, Rudolfsson Lyrics:Karln

Through the streets of chaos in the city where the statues scream. 
In streets where metal meets metal, the mighty tigers of pan-tang. 
Inhuman screaming statues writhes in agony and pain. 
The overlords ride their wagons with proud heads held high. 
I pass the straits of chaos onward to the plains of glass. 
I searched for symbols of evil to open dimensional gates. 
The cult of Slortar, the genius one. 
To slave and serve. 
Become chaos son. 
Spawned from chaos, of evil born, 
the overlord of death reclaims his throne. 
With demonsword in hand and demonguards 
by side the theocrat will rule till the end of time. 
Opening an alternate timespace where fury and storms were born, 
searching for new demonbreeds to raise hell in glorious form. 
Bound for existence eternal in rings of purest gold. 
To show powers to the mortals, raising elemental storms. 
Summoning the travel demon to journey through the plains. 
To fight for what's rightfully ours, guided by Slortar the old. 
The city of the screaming statues belongs to overlord. 
The overlord of death. 
Spawned from chaos, of evil born, 
the overlord of death reclaims his throne. 
With demonsword in hand and demonguards by side 
the theocrat will rule till the end of time.
