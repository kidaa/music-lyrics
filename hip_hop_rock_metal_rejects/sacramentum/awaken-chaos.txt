Music:Brolycke, Rudolfsson Lyrics:Karlen, Rudolfsson

Open your burning eyes and behold what is rising. 
Feeding infernal fires with useless human flesh. 
Light the stars of hatred with fires of burning blackness, 
awaking pure black hearts with blood of our purity. 
Blood of humanity is the sign of our burning honour. 
Laughter and delight, our fires are burning might. 
Chaos prevails, risen are the stars of hatred.
Souls are gathered, behold the awaken chaos. 
Buried are the memories from the dawn of time. 
Gone is the light that we deny. 
Agents of chaos from darkness came, supreme warlords that none can tame. 
Demonic dimensions unknown to man. 
Plains of chaos divine to them, brought forth by men that were pure in heart. 
From the nightspire they came to stay for all our time. 
The black wings of chaotic darkness possess our souls, 
hellfires lick our tears. 
The sun bleeds, it is now gone. 
With chaos came death and pain. 
Blood of humanity is the sign of our burning honour. 
Laughter and delight, our fires are burning might. 
Chaos prevails, risen are the stars of hatred. 
Souls are gathered, behold the awaken chaos.
