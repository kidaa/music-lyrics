Music:Rudolfsson, Brolycke, Andersson Lyrics:Karln, Rudolfsson

The symbolic deeds are done, warcries echoes in the night. 
The golden future is gone, utter violence and might. 
Far away we will forever be,
gathered by wrath and hate. 
Distant warclouds, closer to be. 
Death smiles, we rejoice in our fate. 
Shun the light. 
Shun the light. 
Chaos will rise, blacken the skies. 
Shun the light. 
Shun the light. 
Battles in sight, triumph and might. 
We raise our swords in fury. 
IN FURY! 
We raise our souls in glory. 
IN GLORY! 
Shun the light. 
Shun the light. 
Chaos will rise, blacken the skies. 
Shun the light. 
Shun the light. 
Battles in sight, triumph and might. 
March the earth, we shun the light. 
Triumphant rebirth, a new black dawn. 
March of death, we shun the light. 
Dragons breath, scorch to death. 
When all is ruined once again, 
the horizon crumbled with dust. 
In a bloodcoulored sky we greet the infernal one who reaps with ease. 
Our souls burn forever for the everlasting black flame 
What once was, will forever be. 
Our spirits will never die. 
Shun the light. 
Shun the light. 
Chaos will rise, 
blacken the skies. 
Shun the light. 
Shun the light.
Battles in sight, triumph and might. 
We raise our swords in fury. 
IN FURY!
We raise our souls in glory. 
IN GLORY!
