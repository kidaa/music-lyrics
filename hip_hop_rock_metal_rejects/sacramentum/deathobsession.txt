Black Destiny part II
Music:Rudolfsson, Brolycke, Andersson Lyrics:Karln

Faded is the torch of time, a torch that have lost the flame. 
In the emptiness of endless space, 
a space without morning without sun. 
Old as the stars in the sky, born out of nothingness. 
Out of emptiness, my destiny is black forever. 
Deathobsession. Black nights, haunting skies.
Deathobsession. 
Oblivion and silence. 
Deathobsession. 
Shadows dance in paralysed trance. 
Deathobsession. 
Emptiness rises as I die. 
The nightsky awakes my deadly blood hunger. 
Pitiful victims, cry for thee. 
My blood is so cold, my veins turned to ice. 
My body is dead and so is my mind. 
The mirror is broken, the illusion is gone. 
I am free at last, ooh hear my cry.
Waiting is at end, the hunger is pleased. 
The restlessness is gone,thy black destiny. 
Faded is the torch of time, a torch that have lost the flame. 
In the emptiness of endless space, 
a space without morning without sun. 
Old as the stars in the sky, born out of nothingness. 
Out of emptiness, my destiny is black forever Deathobsession. 
Black nights, haunting skies. 
Deathobsession. 
Oblivion and silence. 
Deathobsession.
Shadows dance in paralysed trance. 
Deathobsession. 
Emptiness rises as I die. 
Deathobsession.
