Music:Rudolfsson, Brolycke Lyrics:Karln

I was carried by a hot wind, which filled me with power. 
The power of hatred, and a infernal burning mind of death. 
Blackened dreams are controlling me. 
I'm searching for their rightful meaning. 
Tomorrow nothing will remain but frozen images from my past. 
Sleeping... dreaming...ruling... 
But these are dreams, things in mind, reveries that thou shalt find. 
Blackened stars of a dying sky, is falling with me. 
Tormented by life's melancholy, eaten by a vast nothingness. 
I am alone, I sink and I rise, 
my dreams have created an everlasting death. 
Sleep to escape, dream to satisfy. Die to please, dreamdeath. 
Sleeping... dreaming... ruling...
But these are dreams, 
things in mind, 
reveries that thou shalt find.
Blackened stars of a dying sky, is falling with me. 
Tormented by life's melancholy, eaten by a vast nothingness. 
I am alone, I sink and I rise, 
my dreams have created an everlasting death. 
Sleep to escape, dream to satisfy. 
Die to please, dreamdeath. 
Even though I know that the caress of death offers no eternity, 
I still want to become a part of it. 
Life won't feed upon my shadow anymore. 
I slept to escape, I dreamed to satisfy, 
I died to please me, dreamdeath.
