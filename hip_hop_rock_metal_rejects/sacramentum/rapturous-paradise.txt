Peccata Mortali
Music:Brolycke, Andersson, Rudolfsson Lyrics:Karln, Rudolfsson

Hungry flames, craving lust.Flesh in chains, desirethirst. 
Blood for pride, honour and lies. 
Love is pain, death is life. 
Superbia, luxuria, ividia, ira, gula, acedia, avaritia, peccata mortali. 
Phantasms of obscenity. Orgies of sadistic arts. 
Ovations for eternal sin. 
Slicing flesh ritual. 
Pounding lust in my veins. 
Need to breed is to create. 
Fires of perverted taste, burning for spirit of death. 
Lead the way rapturous paradise. 
Sins of death, born to sodomize. 
Come to me rapturous paradise.
Let it bleed without compromise. 
Hungry flames, craving lust. 
Flesh in chains, desirethirst. 
Blood for pride, honour and lies. 
Love is pain, death is life. 
Superbia, luxuria, ividia, ira, gula, acedia, avaritia, peccata mortali. 
Phantasms of obscenity. 
Orgies of sadistic arts. 
Ovations for eternal sin. 
Slicing flesh ritual. 
Pounding lust in my veins. 
Need to breed is to create. 
Fires of perverted taste, burning for spirit of death.
Lead the way rapturous paradise. 
Sins of death, born to sodomize. 
Come to me rapturous paradise. 
Let it bleed without compromise.
