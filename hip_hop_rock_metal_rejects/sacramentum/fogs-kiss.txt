Lyrics: Karlen

I was seduced by the moon
when I wondered through my thoughts
On the path to my dreams of unholyness,
an everenfolding milky fog appeared
from the grounds beyond.

Cold white fog kissed and caressed,
and I felt the attraction in wickedness.
As I fell throught the dreamy wet cloud
pain was no more nor fear or sorrow

I slept in hypnotic and hysterious sleep,
I could see and hear through the night.
I had burning candles inside my eyes,
I could smell the purity of innocent blood.I was no longer one of the mortal ones,
Blessed by the mists of darkened realms,
destined to join the force of eternity.
The fog from beyond had lift my soul.

I'm in the air and I'm in the water,
I'm in the earth and I'm in the fire.
I laugh at the helpless mortals
as I leave the grounds forever.

I entered my space beyond
where fragments of my dreams were hidden,
the dark left me on the shore
to eternitys majestic domains.

I slept in hypnotic and hysterious sleep,
I could see and hear through the night.
I had burning candles inside my eyes,
I could smell the purity of innocent blood.
