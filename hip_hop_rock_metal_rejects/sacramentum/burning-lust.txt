Music:Brolycke, Rudolfsson Lyrics:Karln, Brolycke

Violent bleeding orgys of fire, 
unleash all your fucking desires.
Penetrated by morbid lusts, 
mesmerized by desirable perversions. 
Seduced by our own minds,  
caressed by our primal existence. 
In orgys of true desire we all burn. 
The flame's reaching higher. 
Gentle touches of naked skin, 
wombs opened up to let me in. 
Bleeding orgys of fire and sin, 
the beauty of evil is vicious and grim. 
Feel the taste of the serpents kiss,
deep and loving does it exist. 
The beast within has more to win, 
the beauty of evil is vicious and grim. 
Burning lust for sadism. 
Burning lust for blood. 
Burning lust for violence. 
Burning lust for death. 
Violent bleeding orgys of fire, 
unleash all your fucking desires. 
Penetrated by morbid lusts, mesmerized by desirable perversions. 
Seduced by our own minds, caressed by our primal existence. 
In orgys of true desire we all burn. 
The flame's reaching higher. 
On human lust I feed. 
On human pain I breed. 
On human lust I feed my everlasting greed. 
Gentle touches of naked skin,  
wombs opened up to let me in. 
Bleeding orgys of fire and sin, 
the beauty of evil is vicious and grim. 
Feel the taste of the serpents kiss,
deep and loving does it exist. 
The beast within has more to win, 
the beauty of evil is vicious and grim. 
Burning lust for sadism. 
Burning lust for blood. 
Burning lust for violence. 
Burning lust for death. 
On human lust I feed. 
On human pain I breed. 
On human lust I feed my everlasting greed.
