Music:Andersson, Rudolfsson, Brolycke Lyrics:Karln

Ruthless jaws of time tearing at my mind. 
Countless restless years of old and dry tears. 
The winged force of the mind, the releaser of the blind.
Time is bleeding, death is mine 
Kill, bury your sanity. 
Journey beyond wildest dreams, dimensional shifts appear. 
Multiverse overwhelms the weak.
Evil shapeshifts in the skies. 
Greet endlessness with open eyes. 
Reach out and everything dies. 
A rip through time and everything's black. 
The world illusion, time deception. 
Scarlet wings wrapped around the neck. 
Black weave of illusion caresses you all Let none on this earth inherit, 
the great vision of my spirit. 
Blackest night of unfathomed wrath. 
Black weave of illusion will rape you all. 
Kill, bury your sanity. 
Journey beyond wildest dreams, dimensional shifts appear. 
Multiverse overwhelms the weak.
Evil shapeshifts in the skies. 
Greet endlessness with open eyes. 
Reach out and everything dies. 
A rip through time and everything's black. 
The world illusion, time deception. 
Scarlet wings wrapped around the neck. 
Black weave of illusion caresses you all Let none on this earth inherit, 
the great vision of my spirit. 
Blackest night of unfathomed wrath. 
Black weave of illusion will rape you all.
