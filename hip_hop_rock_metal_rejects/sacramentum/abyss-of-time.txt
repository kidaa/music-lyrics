Music:Brolycke, Rudolfsson Lyrics:Karlen

Into oceans of false existence, we all drift away. 
The true essence of time is fragile, 
but my dreams do never die. 
Anxious to reach the bottom,
a bottom that does't exist. 
Time is like the flames of fire. 
It's eating all in its way wither and fall into the abyss of time.
