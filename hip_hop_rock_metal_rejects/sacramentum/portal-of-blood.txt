Music:Brolycke, Rudolfsson Lyrics:KarlnI will come into your soul, 
like a dream and enter your mind, rape your mind. 
I will steel your last life and open up, 
your slumbering mind, your narrow mind. 
Awakening of your lost life. 
You will see the pain that is haunting me. 
I will grant you eternal beauty. 
Come with me and I'll unlock my mind. 
Take my hand, please follow me. 
My dear see what have to be seen.
Leave this time and place. 
Open your portal, see what have to be seen.
Take my hand, please follow me. 
Take my hand and follow me 
Now my dear, give me your life, 
and I'll show you the portal of blood. 
Your shadow is gone , your soul is free. 
You have entered the portal of blood. 
I will come into your soul, 
like a dream and enter your mind, 
rape your mind. 
I will steel your last life and open up, 
your slumbering mind, your narrow mind. 
Awakening of your lost life. 
You will see the pain that is haunting me. 
I will grant you eternal beauty. 
Come with me and I'll unlock my mind.
Take my hand, please follow me. 
My dear see what have to be seen. 
Leave this time and place. 
Open your portal, see what have to be seen. 
Take my hand, please follow me. 
You took my hand and followed me
Now my dear, give me your life, 
and I'll show you the portal of blood. 
Your shadow is gone , 
your soul is free 
You have entered the portal of blood.
