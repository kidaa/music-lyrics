Lyrics: Karlen

Mighty forests speak
of tales that have fallen into oblivion.
Shadows of ancient mountains
is reflecting the past.
On the shores of infinity
I crawl in the bleeding froth,
where traces of my forefathers
still are visible after their wandering
towards the unknown.

Obsolete tears and forgotten wisdom.
I know the past ancient intelligence
of supreme black arts
Behold what eternity shows our mortal eyes,
violet gleams upon the nightsky.
I cry the obsolete tears.

Mighty forests speak
of tales that have fallen into oblivion.
Shadows of ancient mountains
is reflecting the past.
On the shores of infinity
I crawl in the bleeding froth,
where traces of my forefathers
still are visible after their wandering
towards the unknown.In to the silent desolate dead spheres
echoes of wisdom, nothing but tears
buried in monuments of purest gold.
Secrets of the universe oh so old.

Into the midst of the elder ones lair,
spiritual wisdom floats in the air.
The portal is open,
leave the mortal life behind.
The unknown is known,
incredible thoughts.

Obsolete tears and forgotten wisdom.
I know the past ancient intelligence
of supreme black arts
Behold what eternity shows our mortal eyes,
violet gleams upon the nightsky.
I cry the obsolete tears.
