Lyrics: Karlen, Rudolfsson

Hate prevails, vicious waters has begun
to stir inside my soul.
Allow yourself to feel
the purity of your primal essence.

I light the flame of profanity
and do our diabolical signs.
Blasphemous rites under the nightskies,
our cups are filled with blood.

Tremendous wrath,
inhuman torture, sacrifice to our lord.
Sons of blackness stands united
before the final war.

In the name of Satan,
blood shall be spilled.
In the mighty name of Satan,
blood shall be fucking spilled.

Oh Lord, please take these sacrifices
and grant us the strength and power
to do thine will.

Tremendous wrath,
inhuman torture, sacrifice to our lord.
Sons of blackness stands united
before the final war.

In the name of Satan,
blood shall be spilled.
In the mighty name of Satan,
blood shall be fucking spilled.

Oh mighty hordes of darkness
slaughtering the weak.
Their white breasts poured forth blood,
slaughter of the weak.

The mighty steel of blasphemy
shall fuck their bloody hearts.
We shall kill the whores of Christ,
fuck their bloody hearts.
