Music:Rudolfsson, Brolycke Lyrics:Karln, Rudolfsson

In the depths of myself, thriving on the pain. 
Dreams of darkness is so deep. 
Sharp edges of time has cut my soul. 
Death shows the way. 
From nocturnal dreams  voices are singing about the end of life. 
Clear and beautiful is the message from thee. 
Black and silent, is my will to be. 
Am I lead astray, death leads the way. 
My soul enthroned on blackest stone. 
A heart of wisdom beyond my dreams. 
So black, so dark, black as obsidian.
Hymns to inferno is spoken over my parched and hungry lips. 
In the depths of myself, thriving on the pain. 
Dreams of darkness is so deep. 
Sharp edges of time, has cut my soul. 
Death shows the way. 
From nocturnal dreams, voices are singing about the end of life. 
Clear and beautiful, is the message from thee. 
Black and silent, is my will to be. 
Am I lead astray, death leads the way. 
My soul enthroned on blackest stone. 
A heart of wisdom beyond my dreams. 
So black, so dark, black as obsidian.
Impenetratable, surrounds my thoughts. 
Impenetratable, blocks my mind.
Impenetratable, monumental darkness. 
Impenetratable, I am bound. 
With ice cold eyes I stare back at the lame shapeless statues. 
I have killed all my emotions. 
I am the heart and throne of wisdom. 
My soul enthroned on blackest stone. 
A heart of wisdom beyond my dreams. 
So black, so dark, black as obsidian.
