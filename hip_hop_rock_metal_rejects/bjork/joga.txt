all the accidents that happen
follow the dot
confidence makes sense
only with you
you don't have to speak
i feel
emotional landscapes
they puzzle me

then the riddle gets solved and you push me up to this:

...state of emergency...
...how beatuiful to be!...
...state of emergency...
...is where i want to be...

all that no-one sees
you see 
what's inside of me
every nerve that hurts you heal
deep inside of me
you don't have to speak - i feel
emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
confuse

then the riddle gets solved and you push me up to this:

...state of emergency...
...how beatuiful to be!...
...state of emergency...
...is where i want to be...

...state of emergency...

...state of emergency...
