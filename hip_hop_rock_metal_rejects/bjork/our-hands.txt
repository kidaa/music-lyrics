look no further
look no further
look no further
cruelest
almost
always to ourselves
it musn't
get any better
off
it's in our hands it always was
it's in our hands in our hands
it's all there in our hands
it's all there in our hands
well
now
aren't we scaring ourselves
unnecessarily?
aren't we trying too hard?
'cause it's in our hands
it's in our hands
it's all here : it's in our hands 
look no further 
look no further
it's in our hands : it always was
it's in our hands
