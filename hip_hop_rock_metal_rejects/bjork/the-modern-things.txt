all the modern things
like cars and such
have always existed

they've just been waiting in a mountain
for the right moment

listening to the irritating noises
of dinosaurs and people
dabbling outside

all the modern things
have always existed
they've just been waiting

to come out
and multiply
and take over

it's their turn now...
