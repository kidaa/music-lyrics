If you ever get close to a human 
And human behaviour 
Be ready to get confused 

There's definitely no logic 
To human behaviour 
But yet so irristible 

There's no map 
To human behaviour 

They're terribly moody 
Then all of a sudden turn happy 
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange 
Of human emotions is ever so satisfying 

There's no map 
And a compass 
Wouldn't help at all 

Human behaviour
