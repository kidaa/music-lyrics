I travel 
All around the city 
Go in and out of 
Locomotives 
All alone 

There's no one here 
And people everywhere 

Crying 'cause I need you 
Crying I can feel you 
Crying 'cause I need you 
Crying 'cause I care 

It's a hot day 
And I'm dressed lightly 
I move carefully 
Through the crowd 

Here everyone 
Is so vulnerable 
And I'm aswell 

There's no one here 
And people everywhere 

Crying 'cause I need you 
Crying I can feel you 
Crying 'cause I need you 
Crying 'cause I care 

Only if a ship would sail in 
Or just someone came 
And knocked at my door 
Or just or just something 

Crying 'cause I need you 
Crying I can feel you 
Crying 'cause I need you 
Crying 'cause I care
