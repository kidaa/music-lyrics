I've got a girl and Ruby is her name 
She don't love me but I love her just the same 
Ruby, Ruby, how I want you 
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you 
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

Oh, each time I see my baby my heart cries 
I'm gonna steal her away from all those guys 
From the sunny day I met you 
Made a bet that I would get you 
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

Got some loving money too 
Gonna give it all to you

When will you be mine?

My Ruby, my Ruby, my Ruby
When will you be mine?

When will you be mine?
My Ruby, Ruby when will you be mine?
