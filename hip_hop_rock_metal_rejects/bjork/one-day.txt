One day 
It will happen 
One day, one day 
It will all come true 

One day 
When you're ready 
One day, one day 
When you're up to it 

The atmosphere 
Will get lighter 
And two suns ready 
To shine just for you 

I can feel it 

One day 
It will happen 
One day, one day 
It will all make sense 

One day, one day 
You will blossom 
One day, one day 
When you're ready 

An aeroplane 
Will curve gracefully 
Around the volcano 
With the eruption that never lets you down 

I can feel it 

And the beautifullness 
Fireworks will burn 
In the sky just for you 

I can feel it 

One day 
One day
