Come to me 
I'll take care of you 
Protect you 
Calm, calm down 
You're exhausted 
Come lie down 
You don't have to explain 
I understand 

You know 
That I adore you 
You know 
That I love you 
So don't make me say it 
It would burst the bubble 
Break the charm 

Jump off 
Your building's on fire 
I'll catch you 
I'll catch you 
Destroy all that is keeping you back 
And then I'll nurse you 
I'll nurse you 

Come to me 
I'll take care of you 
You don't have to explain 
I understand
