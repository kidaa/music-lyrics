Fish got to swim, birds got to fly 
I got to love one man 'til I die 
Can't help loving that man of mine 

Maybe he's lazy, maybe he's slow 
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I know 
Can't help loving that man of mine 

And when he's away 
That's a rainy day
But when he's back 
The day is fine, the sun will shine 
He can stay out as long as can be 
For without him ain't no home for me 
Can't help loving that man of mine 
Show me.... 

Oh, fish got to swim, birds got to fly 
I got to love one man 'til I die 
Can't help loving that man of mine 
Maybe he's crazy, maybe he's slow 
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I know 
Can't help loving that man of mine 

And when he's away 
That's a rainy day 
But when he's back 
The day is fine, the sun will shine 
He can stay out as long as can be 
For without him ain't no home for me 
Can't help loving that man of mine 
Can't help loving, loving that man of mine 
Can't help....help....help 
Loving that man....man....man 
Man of mine....mine....mine 
I just can't help
