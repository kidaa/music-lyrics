Up on the toe
There is a view
Up on the toe
And the spine

Straight and erect
Hungry and curious
Up on the toe
Looking forward to

The air is thinner here

She came here
To lose face
Got down on her knees
The beast is back!

On four legs
Set her clock to the moon
Raises her spine

Vertebrae by vertebrae
Up on the toe
Looking

I have been filled with steam for months, for years
Same old cloud, claustrophobic me
Let it burst like old train sounds
Make them leave me nature

Vertebrae by vertebrae by vertebrae

My arms squeeze out of my shoulders!

And the arms squeeze out of my shoulders
I curl my tail in words
I set my clock on the moon
Vertebrae by vertebrae

[x3] Please release this pressure of me

Let off some steam
