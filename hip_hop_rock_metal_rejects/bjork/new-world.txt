Train-whistles, a sweet clementine  
Blueberries, dancers in line  
Cobwebs, a bakery sign  

Ooooh - a sweet clementine  
Ooooh - dancers in line  
Ooooh ...  

If living is seeing  
I'm holding my breath  
In wonder - I wonder  
What happens next?  
A new world, a new day to see  

I'm softly walking on air  
Halfway to heaven from here  
Sunlight unfolds in my hair  

Ooooh - I'm walking on air  
Ooooh - to heaven from here  
Ooooh ...  

If living is seeing  
I'm holding my breath  
In wonder - I wonder  
What happens next?  
A new world, a new day to see
