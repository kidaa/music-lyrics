i can not live
peacefully without you
for even a moment
l miss you terribly
when you're away

he's away
this ain't right
i'm alone

i'm taking an aeroplane 
across the world
to follow my heart

how come 
out if all the people in the world
only one
can make me complete
one word on the phone
makes me happy
but one touch directly
makes me ecstatic

he's away
this ain't rigth
i'm alone
i'm taking an aeroplane
across the world
to follow my heart
