Get over the sorrow, girl
The world is always going to be made of this

You can trust in it
Unless you breathe in
Bravely

I adore how you simply surrender to high

And your lungs
They're mourning
Teepee-style

All the still-born love that could've happened
All the moments you should have embraced
All the moments you should have not locked up

Understand
So clearly
To shut yourself up
Is the hugest crime of them all
You're just crying after all
To not want them humans around
Anymore

Get over the sorrow, girl
