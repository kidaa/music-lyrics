if travel is searching
and home has been found

i'm not stopping

i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter
i'll bring back the goods
but i don't know when

thought that i could organise freedom
how scandinavian of me
you sussed it out, didn't you

you could smell it
so you left me on my own
to complete the mission
now i'm leaving it all behind

i'm going hunting
i'm the hunter...

you just didn't know me!

you just didn't know me!
