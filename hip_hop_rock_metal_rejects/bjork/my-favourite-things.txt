Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens 
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens 
Brown paper packages tied up with string 
These are a few of my favourite things 

Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple strudels 
Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles 
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings 
These are a few of my favourite things 

When the bee stings 
When the dog bites 
When I'm feeling bad 
I simply remember my favourite things 
And then I don't feel so sad
