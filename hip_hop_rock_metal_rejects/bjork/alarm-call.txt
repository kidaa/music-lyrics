I have walked this earth 
And watched people 

It doesn't scare me at all 

I can be sinsere 
And say I like them 

It doesn't scare me at all 

You can't say no to hope 
Can't say no to happiness 

I want to go on a mountain-top 
With a radio and good batteries 
And play a joyous tune and 
Free the human race
From suffering 

It doesn't scare me at all 

I'm no fucking buddhist 
But this is enlightenment 

The less room you give me 
The more space I've got

It doesnt scare me at all 

You can't say no to hope 
Can't say no to happiness 

It doesn't scare me at all 

I want to be on a mountain-top 
With a radio and good batteries 
And play a joyous tune and 
Free the
A-human race 
From suffering 

It doesn't scare me at all 

This is an alarm-call
So wake-up, wake-up now
Today has never happened 
And it doesnt frighten me 

It doesn't scare me at all 

You can't say no to hope 
You can't say no to happiness 

It doesn't scare me at all
