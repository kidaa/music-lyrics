The white hand, proud and strong by ruling the realm of Isengard, White as
consciousness of illuminated mind spirit became flesh, symbolized by the
hand. That's true cleanness, being able to raise the world out of its
hinges
and create it new: Behold the banner's flying, it calls to join, because
the
white hand prevails...
White Hand's Power to the realm of Isengard, White Hand's Elegance to the
Kings of Isengard White Hand's Supremacy to the ancestors of middle-earth
White Hand's Dominion to the end of the world...and to universe at next!!!
Marching southwards, orkish battlecries in air, heavy boots crush down
weakness in dust. Warriors executing inferior lifes by fireword: Submit or
die. Creatures of odd... Creatures of ill... Creatures of mud...
Degenerated
by mixed blood! Submission, Submission, Submission To the splendid kings of
Isengard, to the race born of ice and flames!
White Hand's Power to the realm of Isengard, White Hand's Elegance to the
Kings of Isengard White Hand's Supremacy to the ancestors of middle-earth
White Hand's Dominion to the end of the world...and to universe at next!!!
