Cruel coldness turns my heart to ice
heavy snowy clouds, covered the nightly sky
Snow is falling, wind is blowing and its cold.
Blood in my veins got stopped, woulded I await my last hour
hen the snow covers my body when the icy ship takes me
to the land of the gods.
A dream makes union with reality cold snow hurts my eyes
The forest is far from here and my horse is dead
I lost my last battle victory was so near... in the snowy bed
I found my peace
Now I'm waiting for drackar
Gods promised me it will come soon
