You who have become the legend! I summon you mighty warriors! Your power,
honour and pride Shall encourage all of us.
The same blood runs in our veins.
But our brothers' minds are poisoned.
Their spirit should be purified.
Enemies' temples burnt to the ground...
We raise the swords and start new war Against the plague of foreign Gods.
Fidelity and pagan pride Will lead us to the final glory!
Nothing can deafen voice of blood.
Instinct decodes every lie.
Strong arms will soon throw down the chains
And bring the lost dignity back...
Let's raise the swords forged in blood Together with forefathers' ghosts.
Invisible astral power Shall turn us into cruel beasts.
Immortal are the ideals for which we fight and proudly die. There is a
flame
of heritage, that every man has to protect.
We are the last bastion of truth.
Those who have never betrayed their roots.
The heathen fire of our hearts
Can only raise but never go out!
We take an oath on our swords
To raise them when it's time to fight.
When alien offend our faith.
And spit on forefathers' grave...
