does it hurt you when you breathe
stink around the wallet itch
a towel was thrown between the ropes
sweat inside your eyelids
it exorcised the fire from the sky
snakecharmer make them dance again
it exorcised the fire from the sky
make them itch in kerosene dance

prepare your sleep apparatus

autopsy performed on probable cause
while you sleep
they will come and get you tonight
so i guess this is goodnight...

skip with elbowed sobs
your palms were soaking wet
parched in the stupor
elbowed, teach the tutor
peel the scabs
incognito with wounds
this anecdote fountain
won't dry too soon

500 times
'i must not talk out of turn'

no vents opened
but all settlements new
a second native
for deserved growth

permission to land
all systems go...
propeller snapped
decapitated while you slept
upon your pillow

inertia kisses those around me.
