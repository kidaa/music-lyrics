Can we forget about the things I said
when I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me 
Please tell me, please tell me Why
My car is in the front yard,
and I'm Sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And your gone
Gone
It's no suprise to me I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, 
and there's a cigarette Still burning, 
Please tell me why my car is in the front yard
and I'm sleeping with my clothes on 
came in through the window last night and your gone 
gone please tell me why my car is in the front yard 
and I'm sleeping with my clothes on 
I came in through the window last night
It's no suprise to me 
I am my own worst enemy 
'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
Can we forget about the things I said
when I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that
