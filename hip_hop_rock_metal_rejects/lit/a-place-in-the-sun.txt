Gotta get that feeling
God I love this feeling
Someone come and stop me cuz this I'm winning
I should have left you when I was up
I should have left you when I was up
I should've had enought sense to
Get up and leave this town
I should've had enough sense to
It was a turn around
Walking through the golden sands I'm quenching my thirst
Jump into the fountain and I'm going head first
Lost in a place in the sun
And it's going down
It's going down
It's going down
It's going down
I should have left you when I was up
I should have left you when I was up
I should've had enought sense to
Get up and leave this town
I should've had enough sense to
It was a turn around
I should've had enought sense to
Get up and leave this town
I should've had enough sense to
It was a turn around
Lost in a place in the sun
And it's going down
It's going down
It's going down
It's going down
