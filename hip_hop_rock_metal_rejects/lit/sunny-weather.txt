I've got a hundred thousand watts, hundred thousand dollar stereo  
Surrounded by speakers but I'm mono as hell   
Got a hundred sad songs about the day that you walked out  
And I'm feeling so down   
It's just a bad situation  

I wish that I could say that...

[CHORUS:]
I don't care about the sunny weather   
Don't care about the sex when we're together   
Don't care about nothing if you don't care 

Why don'tcha

I've got a lotta new drugs but I don't know how to use 'em  
So I threw 'em in the trash and now my dogs are high as hell 
Got a hundred better reasons why you oughta stick around 
And I'll never back down  
It's just another situation

I can't control it now...

[CHORUS]

I'd give it all away for you   
For just another day with you   
What am I gonna do   
I don't care about nothin'  [X 3]
If you don't care  

[CHORUS]

I don't care about the sunny weather   
Don't care and man I wish I never met her   
Don't care about nothin' if you don't care
