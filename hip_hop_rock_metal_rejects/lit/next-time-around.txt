Well I'm dreaming 'bout a Cadillac   
And a girl that I used to have   
But I know that I could never go back   
To the day we took a photograph   
That I'm holdin' in my hand   
I can't believe I messed it up so bad   
If I get another chance   
I'd never waste it yeah  
I swear I'll be a better man   

[CHORUS:]
And I'll tell you right now  
We'll make it up next time around 
Yeah!  
I'll pick you up and never put you down  
Next time around  
Yeah!  
I'll lift you up and never let you down

Now I'm thinkin' bout the good times  
All the friends that I used to know  
And they always said they'd have my back   
But now I'm flyin' solo  
All alone again I stand  
I can't believe I messed it so bad  
If I had another chance   
I'd never waste it yeah 
I'll try and be a better man

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

[CHORUS X 2]

Next time around...
