I shoulda called but it was late and you were sleeping, my dear    
I would hate for you to hear what I was putting you through   
I'm tryin' hard to be the man I know that you think I am  
I'm really glad you weren't there but now I wish you were here

[BRIDGE:]
Cuz we're so wonderful   
And so untouchable  
And just when I thought it was under control   
Everything just starts to...

The pillow burns I toss & turn from all of the things I say   
You should've known better than to ever listen to me  

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS:]
Slip 
Right through my fingers  
Finding it's way to the tips  
Well I'll try and forget  
But all that I taste is your lips  
Cryin' & kissin' me

[guitar solo]

[BRIDGE 2:]
We're so wonderful   
And so untouchable   
You're the biggest part of me     
We're so wonderful   
And so untouchable   
And just when I thought it was under control  
Everything....  
Everything....

[CHORUS X 2]
