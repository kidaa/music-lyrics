She wakes up lonely
She wakes up lonely
She hangs a picture by the phone
She hangs a picture by the phone 
Yeah, she doesn't think we're gonna make it
But when I'm home we're sleeping naked
And we pretend that we're in love
She wakes up lonely
And she telephones me
To ask me if I'm coming home
She says "Will you be coming home"
Yeah, She doesn't think we're gonna make it
But when I'm home we're sleeping naked
And we pretend that we're in love 
it was different when we thought that we wanted the same thing 
everything was figured out 
and now it doesn't make much sense 
yeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh
it's just another thing she can't get 
she doesn't think we're gonna make it 
but when i'm home we're sleeping naked 
and we pretend that we're in love yeeeeeeeaaaaahh 
she likes to think we're in love 
she like to think that we're in love
