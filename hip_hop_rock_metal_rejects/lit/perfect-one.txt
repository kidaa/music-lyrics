I'm an ordinary man
With an ordinary life
Does she know that I'm alive
Man she's really something else
You're the perfect one
And I don't expect a thing from you at all
You're the perfect one
And I can't even breathe
You are, so unpredictable
Sometimes, I'd like to be that way
Your charm, so irresistable
You are really something else
You're the perfect one
And I don't expect a thing from you at all
You're the perfect one
And I can't even breathe
I get weak when she's around
I can't speak when she's around
Yeah, she turns me upside down
Man she's really something else
Yeaaah
You're the perfect one
And I don't expect a thing from you at all
You are everything
That I never knew I've always wanted
You're the perfect one
And I don't expect a thing from you at all
You're the perfect one
And I can't even breathe
I'm an ordinary man
