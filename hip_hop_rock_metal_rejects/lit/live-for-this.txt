I've been fallin' apart at the seams    
But it's not as it seems  
Broken pieces around at my feet  
That I dance on   
In my darkest day   
In my darkest day  I can find you   
We've come all this way   
And I'm still runnin' after it  
Yeah

[CHORUS:]
I, I, live for this  
I, I, I'd trade it for nothin'

I've been waiting for someone like you   
To be waiting for me   
This is more than I ever dreamed  
And I dream on   
I wish I could stay  
I wish I could stay 
Right beside you   
We've come all this way   
And I'm still lookin' after you

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

In my darkest day 
In my darkest day   
I can find you   
We've come all this way  
And I'm still runnin' after it  
Yeah  

[Solo: A Jay :]  I, I, live for this  I, I...

I'd trade it for nothin

[CHORUS]
