She calls me up  
Says she's comin' over   
So I run home  
oooh-ooh 
Just to wait around    
She calls me names  
Then we play some mind games    
And I don't know  
oooh-ooh 
But I think I like it

Now she's the only one 
Who blocks my number 
And she's the only one call

[CHORUS:]
Yeah, oh yeah
What's wrong with me  
Yeah, oh yeah
Why can't I see  
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm so addicted to you...and you're such a dick to me

She flies me out  
Got a big surprise planned   
In Chicago  
oooh-ooh  
That's my kinda town   

She says she's been a ho  
Had to let me know   
On the Jerry Springer Show

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

I wrap myself
Around her little finger
And she gives me the middle one

[CHORUS]

She calls and I come runnin' back   
I call, she never calls me back   
What's wrong with me  
I'm so addicted to you...and you're such a dick to me
