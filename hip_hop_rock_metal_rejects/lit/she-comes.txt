Common sense   
Goes out the window like a cigarette   
I take a hit again   
When all her friends  
They talk about me in a past tense  
I take the hit again

[BRIDGE:]
She walks in in the middle of the night   
Like we're good to go  
All screwed up but it just feels right  
And I don't wanna know where you go   
Or how we went wrong  
And when I think I can't go on

[CHORUS:]
She comes 
And she comes  
But when she goes she always takes away the best of me  
She comes 
And she comes 
And when she's done I'm left with nothin' but the rest of me  

Ignorance   
My only explanation for this mess  
I think about it when  
We're on the fence  
Between what is and what it should've been  
I take the hit again

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Whatever she does    
I always come undone

[guitar solo]

[CHORUS]

Whatever she does    
I always come undone

I always come undone
