Yeah I want to write this song about my Cadillac 
Cuz ther're so fuckn' cool 
The Nineteen sixties 
I dont care if I get Eight miles to the gallon 
Caddies are the sh*t 
Next one's a sixty one cuz I love fins
Me and all my friends can fit 
And shotgun dont mean dick 
Cuz every seats first class 
Throw in for gas 
We'll take it to Vegas 
We're ridin' like Elvis a cop in the truck 
We got to fill again Down at Rip's 
I am proud to be American 
When i see the chrome and fins 
I think the the wreath and sheild should be on the flag
Caddys are bad ass 
I Need to get some more how about a Sixty-four 
Cuz I love fins
