You kiss me on the way up
Kick me when I fall down
Under the radar
Stick me in the lost and found
Lipstick and bruises
Up and down

[CHORUS:]
This is what you always wanted
It's what you asked for
This is what you always wanted
And now you want more

Now these are all your new friends
Baby, you're a rock star now
Runnin' with the devil
Kiss me when the lights go down
Lipstick and bruises
Up and down

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

Kiss me when the lights go down
Lipstick and bruises
Up and down

This is what you always wanted
It's what you asked for
This is what you always wanted
And now you want more
And now you want more
And now you want more
It's what you wanted
It's what you needed
And now you want more
