It's behind you and
It's in your face
Close your eyes
Selling years of their
Smoke and mirrors and
Open minds
And they try to find a way to make me something that 
I'm not
I touched the world
I felt the sun
I know the best is yet to come undone
I looked around
At everyone
I know the best is yet to come undone
The best is yet to come undone
It's so obvious
That the promise
Keeps me here
Painting pictures where
All the colors Disappear And they try to find a way to make me something that I'm not
I touched the world
I felt the sun
I know the best is yet to come undone
I looked around
At everyone
I know the best is yet to come undone
The best is yet to come undone
The best is yet to come undone
And I find my way out
And I find my way out
It's so obvious
That the promise
Keeps me here
Painting pictures where
All the colors Disappear
And they try to find a way to make me something that I'm not
I touched the world
I felt the sun
I know the best is yet to come undone
I looked around
At everyone
I know the best is yet to come undone
Touched the world
Felt the sun
I know the best is yet to come undone
I looked around
At everyone
I know the best is yet to come undone
The best is yet to come undone
The best is yet to come undone
