They say something I don't wanna hear
Ringin' like a shotgun in my ear
But they don't know what I'm really aimin' for
Gonna leave a mark on society

[BRIDGE:]
Faster and faster my whole situation 
Fallin' apart, crossin' my heart
And I hope to live
But something has to give

[CHORUS:]
'Cuz I just wanna be something
I just wanna be someone
Someone who stands out in the crowd
Mother would be proud
Something to someone

These days gettin' shorter by the year
Tickin' like a time bomb loud and clear

[BRIDGE 2:]
Faster and faster the whole situation
Fallin' apart, straight from the heart
Then I sing my song
And I'll prove them wrong

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

[BRIDGE 3:]
Faster and faster my own situation
Rollin' along, provin' you wrong
And you can't believe
What you see when you're lookin' at me...

[CHORUS x 2]

Somethin' to someone [x 2]
