It wouldn't be so bad
If I could take a good thing and make it last
Money for the rent
Time that I spent, me and my girlfriend
My heart is broken down again
I blame it on myself
It wouldn't be so bad
If I could take a good thing and make it last
Money in the bank
Gas in the tank, me and my girlfriend
I'm crawling through the crowd again
And I'm looking for myself
It makes me mad
Cuz I wanna be happy so bad
It makes me mad
Cuz I wanna be happy so bad
You don't even care
Stepping out
Take it in
Starting over again Falling out
Starting over
It makes me mad
Cuz I wanna be happy so bad
It makes me mad
Cuz I wanna be happy
It makes me mad
Cuz I wanna be happy so bad
It makes me mad
Cuz I wanna be happy so bad
It makes me mad
I wanna be happy so bad
It makes me mad
I wanna be happy so bad
