Love is where I'd like to spend time away from you
Lost the weakest part of this 
Taking over me 
I can't ease your mind 
And nothing goes away 
Harder to move on
And easy to stay away 
Float above the world 
And yet still I can't find it 
Then I burn myself in wax 
Jesus candle red 
You can ease your mind 
And it will be your friend We should disappear
And then we won't fade away 
I can't go on can't get away 
All that I love is part of my pain 
Giving up or let's watch our lives taken away 
Our love is dead, 
but can't find a grave
Giving up
