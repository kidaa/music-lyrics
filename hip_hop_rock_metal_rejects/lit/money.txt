I think I want my money back 
This isn't what I thought it would be 
This isn't what you promised me, so I think I changed my mind 
I think we ought to get it back 
To where we should've started from 
I know I should've been up front, but I can't help myself 
Oh, can you steal it 
Deal it 
Feel it with your hand, on my back 
If I could change your mind 
Well I'd be just fine 
But you won't change mine 
And you get what's coming to you and I get mine 
So let's get back 
To where we should've started from 
I know I should've been up front, but I can't help myself 
Oh, can you see it 
Breathe it 
Feel it with my hand on your back 
If I could change your mind 
Well I'd be just fine 
But you won't change mine 
And you get what's coming to you and I get mine 
So let's get back 
If I could change your mind 
Well I'd be just fine 
Yeah, it's the money 
Yeah, it's the money that I want 
It's the money 
Yeah, it's the money that I want 
It's the money 
Yeah, it's the money that I want 
It's the money 
Yeah, it's the money that I want
