Got a tattoo   
Got it colored in with blue  
Cuz it's a picture of your cold, sad face   
And now it's true  
We're probably better off apart 
And we knew it from the start 
That you never wanna stop  
Wanting me wanting you no

Get up I think it's time for you to go   
I don't know why you stay or what you're waiting for

[CHORUS:]
I'll get by   
As long as you want me  
I'll be fine  
As long as you need me  
As long as you leave me

Got a new shirt 
Tryin' to cover up the hurt 
Cuz I don't ever wanna show you what you did 
And now it's done  
We're so much better off in bed  
But we're fucked up in the head 
And we never wanna stop 
Wanting more 
Such a whore no

Get up and let me watch you dance some more   
We both know why you came and what you're looking for

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

Never wanna stop never wanna stop  [X 2]
