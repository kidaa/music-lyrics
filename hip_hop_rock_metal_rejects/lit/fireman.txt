Give me a dollar on four
I can't take anymore 
My head is like a cage 
I'm feeling in a rage 
I ain't got nothing to lose 
I'm left with what i had
My head is like a cage 
I'm feeling in a rage 
I want to be like the sun
I want to feel like a flame from a gun 
I'm soaken;
Empty out my can 
I'm broken; 
You won't understand 
I'm ruunin; 
Catch me if you can 
I'm burnin';
I'm the fireman
