I'm in over my head
They wanna try and build me up
So they can tear me down
I wish that I could be back there
But I'm writing here right now 

They've taken everything that I've had to give and
They say it's over but man I'm still here livin
I don't know what to do, I think that maybe

I'm in over my head
Stuck in the red
Somethin they said
Makes me think that I'm in over my head
Over my head
Over my head

I've got to get away from here
And it couldn't be too soon
Cuz I see the stars are here with me
Like rockets to the moon

You take me everywhere that I've never been and
Show me the meaning of what life had to give and
I don't know what to say, I think that maybe

I'm in over my head
Lyin in her bed
Somethin she said
Makes me think that I'm in over my head
Over my head
Over my head

They've taken everything that I've had to give and
They say it's over but man I'm still here livin
I don't know what to do, I think that maybe

I'm in over my head
Stuck in the red
Somethin they said
Makes me think that I'm in over my head
Over my head
Over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
