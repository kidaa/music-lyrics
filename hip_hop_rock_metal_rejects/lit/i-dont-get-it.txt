I Dont Get It I dont get why you take such a big amount of what we 
Work so hard to f*ckin' make I don't get why we can't do 
What we want to when it doesn't hurt you I don't get it 
I don't get why we can't smoke 
Just because you say it's bad 
What mother nature chose to grow I don't get it I don't why we should change 
What we said here to so 
We dont have to expalin I don't get it I can't make sense of anything 
I can't make sense of anything I can't make friends with anyone 
I don't get anything at all It doesn't matter anymore
