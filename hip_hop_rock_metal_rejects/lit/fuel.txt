Look around and see who's is watching 
What do they think 
You're such a happening player 
I don't do this for myself 
For my enjoyment 
I only want to impress you 
You're so amazing to me 
How you know everything 
and You're just so cool it makes me sick 
You give me ammunition 
you are my gasoline
I hope you stick around cuz You kill me
You fuel me 
Tell me what I need to do 
I'll change just for you 
I'm just a stupid whore 
I don't even listen to this kind of music 
I only want to be famous
You're so much fun to be with
And someone to be seen with 
I'm no one when you are not around
