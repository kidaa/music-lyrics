Timeless sheets of gold 
Underneath the sand here lies a friend 
Funeral in my heart
Buried in myself you'll live again 
I can't tell you want to hear 
I can't give you what you need to heal 
I can't touch you what you need to feel
My faith is scarred 
So help me god 
I wished I believed in Miracles or so they said 
Timeless sheets of gold
Underneath the sand here lies a friend 
Funeral in my heart
Buried in myself you'll live again 
I can't tell you want to hear
I can't give you what you need to heal 
I can't touch you what you need to feel
I don't know how I'm dealing with the pain
From what you've been through 
All I know I'm a better human being being Just that I've known you 
What know is that it kills me when I think of what you went through 
All I know I'm a better human being being 
Just that I've known you 
My faith is scarred 
God damn you God
