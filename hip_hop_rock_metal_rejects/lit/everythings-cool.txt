I hit the city by 3 
And the bottle by 4 
I'm thinkin about the shit that I pulled the night before 
And by the party at midnight everything is cool again 
Cuz you'll be back with me then 

I'm carryin the weight 
The weight of the world 
That doesn't wanna wait for me 
It spins me all around 
And then it spits me out 
Recycled like a Christmas tree 

You picked me up when no one would 
Convince me baby its all good 
You're doing it again the way you always could 
And now everything is understood 
I never had a girl like this 

I hit the city by 3 
And the bottle by 4 
Im thinkin about the shit that I pulled the night before 
And by the party at midnight everything is cool again 
Cuz you'll be back with me then 

the walls are closing in its closing time again 
I see it through my champagne glasses 
Terrified of how the time is flyin now 
At least we're sittin in first class 
Never wanna be like them 

I hit the city by 3 
And the bottle by 4 
I'm thinkin about the shit that I pulled the night before 
And by the party at midnight everything is cool again 
Cuz you'll be back with me then 

I'm carryin the weight of the world 
That doesnt wanna wait for me 
I'm carryin the weight of the world 
Your carrying me 
I never had a girl like this 

I hit the bottle by 6 and another cigarette 
Are probably 2 things that I know i should be quittin 
Any by the party at midnight everything is cool by then 
Cuz you'll be back with me then [3x]
