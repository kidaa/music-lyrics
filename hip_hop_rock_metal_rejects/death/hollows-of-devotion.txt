Baby I can't take myself away from you
It's absolutely positively what you do
So drive me outta my mind
Before you lead me one kiss at a time

Come on baby kiss me crazy
Tell me that you miss me baby
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
Kiss me crazy come on baby
Only your two lips can save me
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
I want you

My heart is so impatient when I'm here alone
I need more of you so baby hurry home
I can't wait for your touch
It moves me, shakes me, gives me such a rush

Come on baby kiss me crazy
Tell me that you miss me baby
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
Kiss me crazy come on baby
Only your two lips can save me
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
I want you

Baby, baby kiss me crazy
Baby, baby kiss me crazy
Baby, baby kiss me

Come on baby kiss me crazy
Tell me that you miss me baby
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
Kiss me crazy come on baby
Only your two lips can save me
You know what I've got
Give me what I want
I want you
