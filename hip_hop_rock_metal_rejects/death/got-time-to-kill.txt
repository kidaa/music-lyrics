Sometimes I wallow, in an air,
Somewhere between a state of good intention and pathos - no worries!
I've got time to kill!
Wear my bleeding heart on a discerning sleeve,
The mind is there but the spirit's weak - time to worry!
When the time is killing concern.
Presumption, an assumption.
Redemption - unsolved.
Riding on the perseverance of others with armchair ideology.
I'm a link in a chain of strength.
Destructive inner fatigue corroding our effectiveness.
Got to kick myself into gear,
Instead of shrinking from activity.
I've got time to kill my concern!
