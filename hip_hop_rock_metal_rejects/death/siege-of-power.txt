Siege of power in your land
Too many problems for you to understand
Siege of power inside your mind
Outward restrictions to keep you in line
Siege of power in your land
Too many problems - for you to understand
You're a slave to their power
you never questioned why
you were born to suffer
you are going to die
Siege of power, they made you a tool
While others were ruling you were being ruled
