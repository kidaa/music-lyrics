R. Cavestany
Guilty of no crime
Not enough yet too much time
I'm burning in this hell
Plans to buy and dreams to sell
Sitting by myself
Living life and loving life
But something bothers me
What to do - I can't believe
I'm bored
Life it's not so fair
Nothing here and nothing there
I'm waiting constantly
It's not the way life's meant to be
Boredom starts to set
I try so hard but it's all I get
Keep waiting all the time
I think I've reached
The end of the line
I'm bored
