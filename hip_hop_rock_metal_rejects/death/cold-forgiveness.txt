Music: Harris, Pintado; lyrics: Embury
25 years severed,
Take it and like it,
Feel like there's nothing more,
And your story.
Thirsty, despised,
Real love destroys.
Hungry for anger.
Hungry for... anger.
The face behind the face x4         Chorus

Cold forgiveness meant not for me x4

The face behind the face x4         

Cold forgiveness meant not for me x4
Race against time, collapse.
Fall in line, nothing is sacred.
Chorus
