It's the time of the awakening.
The fear of a monotonous world.
Each day embrased by invisible bounds.
My imagination is destroyed.
I'm standing alone in this room.
I can't feel my heart beat anymore.
My breath seems to stand still.
This endless emptiness in my head.
My thoughts are spinning circles,
Striking each other out.
My mind is blank-endless emptiness.
There's no way out.
The fear of failing bounds my mind.
I'm waiting for a sign.
A sign from the master of the world.
Show me the way, the way out.
It's the time of the awakening.
The fear of a monotonous world.
Each day embrased by invisible bounds.
My imagination is destroyed.
I'm standing alone in this room.
I can't feel my heart beat anymore.
My breath seems to stand still.
This endless emptiness in my head.
My thoughts are spinning circles,
Striking each other out.
My mind is blank-endless emptiness.
There's no way out.
The fear of failing bounds my mind.
I'm waiting for a sign.
A sign from the master of the world.
Show me the way, the way out.
