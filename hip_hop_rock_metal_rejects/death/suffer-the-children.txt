Your unflappable conception moralistic views
Never open to criticism your overpowering ruse
Promises of sanctuary in eternal bliss
With starry eyes and cash in hand
Pledge all to the masters plan
Just face the truth or fund the farce
At one with your god your sole intent
Your treasured place assured
For a substantial rent
Global lucancy death threats for supposed blasphemy
No room for free thought
All non believers pushed to the floor
Agressive tyrans supposed saints for the cause
Judgement through force faith a fuel for pointless war
When all is done who shall benefit? Who is the one?
Not those dictators divine waving their deceintful wands
