Carries on it's trapped into my head
Missing you and wanting you around
If you feel the same

Carries on it's trapped into my veins
Chasing dragons is such a burning flame
The needle is you

Need to let it drain
Because it feeds my brain

Carries on it's trapped into my head
Been around I'm sick of these games
Oh, down here it's me
Wait down, wait down
I guess I don't know when I'll be done

Anyway it's bad
Cause now I see you're sad
Down here it's me, you should have never call me back
