Music: Harris, Lyrics: Harris
Fate has brought us here
Picture geffing clear
See right through you
I see right through you
I feel for no one
Where have my feelings gone?
All too powerful
Witness this as I stand the fest of time
In eternal sleep
You gave me your word
More than life itself
I breathe new life
Help save me from life-taking actions
Which will destroy myself
I can't destroy myself
There is no defence like this confidence
Ideas dawn upon seeking relevance
There's no turning back
There's no turning back
