music: Nick, Costas lyrics: Nick, Jake
Liquid sky on the wing of a butterfly
Numbers are running and seconds are numbing 
Daisy chain of an infinite combination
Factors are lying for what can be done
You think you have control
You`re nothing but a role
In a theater of distrust 
The sun follows the rain
Questions and answers never related to me
To solve this riddle I need the master-key
Coincidence shatters my reality
Who is the puppet player of all these?
chorus
Who cares about the colors you see?
Who cares about this fading star?
You read these letters, but who reads you?
Maybe all your life is a simple RANDOM`S MANIFEST!
Slowly I have the chance to understand
The chaos is changing all before my eyes
I cannot comprehend-pure madness is running after me
Random`s Manifest at every sight-the things are changing
