Sitting on a carousel ride without any music or light.
Everything was closed at coney island, and i could not help from smiling. 

I can hear the atlantic echo back roller coaster screams from summers past.
And everything was closed at coney island, and i could not help from smiling.
Brooklyn will fill in the beach eventually and everyone will go except me.
