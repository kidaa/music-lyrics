My friend my friend
You were loyal and true
'Till that wretch of a woman
Well she got to you
My friend my friend
I been down on my knees
But I won't be beggin'
No more beggin' please

The black spot the black spot
Never thought I'd be the one givin' it to you
The black spot the black spot
My heart just ain't in it no more

My lover my lover
We sure had somethin' strong
'Till you took our love away
And left before long
My lover my lover
I been down on my knees
But I won't be beggin'
No more beggin' please

The black spot the black spot
Never thought I'd be the one givin' it to you
The black spot the black spot
My heart just ain't in it no more

You can build a love up
Make the foundation strong
But soon the cracks start to show
You can build a love up
As best as you can
But sooner or later
It's gonna show
