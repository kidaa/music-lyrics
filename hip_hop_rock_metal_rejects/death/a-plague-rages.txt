Scale the inferno,
Take it all in.
Am I right or wrong, or just confused?
Glamourised, Dare I say it?
Fantasised, but through whose eyes?
Not theirs, that's for sure!
Rebuff beliefs that we've lost.
A plague rages in all our hearts.
Am I the last in line?
To stop and turn,
And pretend that we've really changing.
I'd sooner die............
