I'll leave a trail of fire across this desert just to see the desperation in
your eyes you think you've suffered well you ain't seen shit yet the pain won't set in for a long long time I've fought off angels with my hands behind my back I've set the heavens all on fire so sleep in the fallout shelter tonight one and all and wrap the children up real tight and stop the bleedin before it starts stop the bleedin before it starts.
