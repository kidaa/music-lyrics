R. Cavestany, D. Pepa
The crack of dawn fills the empty sky
We turn our heads towards the east
Between the hills
Walk the paths of love
Towards the caverns of the beast
A distant cry breaks the solitude
Of weary men who journey on
To see the sight horrifies us all
The magic wind blows and it's gone
Chorus
Searching for answers
Another clue on the list
Searching for answers
To questions that cease to exist
Decipher the runes of earth
We travel forth to the lake of death
The guardian says that we must pay
The price is high for he demands a life
So it's he we must slay
Beyond the gates
Forests of the darkness
Without the key you'll not get in
We weave the spell
Of time and dimension
Which plants us on
The shores of sin
Chorus
