Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you 
FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART

Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
FUCK YOU

[Verse 1:]
I dont want to be your tourniquet
For minor lacerations
Dont wanna be your Romeo 
Because youre no Goddamn Juliet
you always did know just what to say; insult and injury
YOU JUST LOVE TO HATE ME!

[Chorus:]
Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you 
FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART

Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
FUCK YOU

[Verse 2:]
Youve got a gun
Ive got a gun 
Lets write a tragic ending
Dont wanna be this way again
Dont wanna be the one to blame
you can have the high roads; Ill take the roads, disguise the frailty
I JUST LOVE TO HATE YOU!

[Chorus:]
Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you 
FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART

Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
FUCK YOU

[Outro:]
YOU JUST LOVE TO HATE ME!
Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you 
FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART

Its not enough 
Its not enough 
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
FUCK YOU
