Music: Embury; lyrics: Greenway
Take the strain! Can you take it?
Take the strain! Or even fake it?
Take the strain! Aren't we lucky
Take the strain! to be breathing?
Take the strain!
Are you the man in the next bed
Without the tubes, without the life support?
Maybe the man whose pockets weigh you down/
Take the strain! Do you wear strife
Take the strain! like a clown?
Take the strain! Forgiveness
Take the strain! with a frown!
Take the strain!
Are you the animal
That escapes the snares and traps?
Bearing no quarry scars, and the hunter's crown.
We were taught to follow leaders - follow leaders!
NEver to challenge the singular pack.
The goals they set slip the grasp - slip our grasp!
Chaising tails without the basic facts.
Choose full pain, violate, make the grade.
Taut wires fray, electro-brain, take the strain!
We were taught to follow leaders - follow leaders!
Never to challenge the singular pack.
The goals they set slip the grasp - slip our grasp!
Chaising tails without the basic facts.
