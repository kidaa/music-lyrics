Where is the person that could have been
Who,what took over,when did the end begin
Should we not prepare for the uncertain
Mysteries of our life,of our destiny
See things that are not there
Intruding voices
What went wrong to their picture perfect life
They once knew - Flattering of Emotions
Solo: Schuldiner
Solo: Masvidal
A mind shared by an uninvited stranger
Which comes and goes as choose to appear
Should we not prepeare for the uncertain
Mysteries of our life,of our destiny
Repeat 2nd verse
