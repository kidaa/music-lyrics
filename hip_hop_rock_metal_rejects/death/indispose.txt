Music: Harris, Lyrics: Harris
Do you think you can trust?
Your mind made up of the things
That cause you to live your life
Displaced
Dispose
Give in
You've got the best of me
Wear thin
Resisting qualities
I had no choice
You've got the best of me
Force me to voice
Resisting qualities
They blame you
Beat you
Drain you of remaining morsels
As you tremble
Shattered
Scattered now before you
They wipe your face in disgust
Indispose
Despite the fact
Accept the fact
You dave your best
