music: Dennis lyrics: Jake
Don`t be scared of my view
Once I was like you and everyone
Sense excelled in my mind 
And my love for you was endless
The bitterness you gave me was abundant
The pain nestled in my soul because of you
Although I got tired of forgiving your mistakes
I didn`t let you think I hate you
chorus
We`ll meet each-other somewhere, that`s for sure
Maybe between fire and steel or clouds and sun
The blood spreading around your body will remember me
The passion and the deliverance from this Psycho Love
Once I made you come closer, feeling some compassion despite my mental illness
Your dead body lying behind me, your lifeless eyes looking me
Prove that you can`t be behind me alive anymore
I took your life joined with me
I`m not begging for sympathy or understanding
Walking together on life`s highway might be useless 
If your soul is alive 
She will hate me, that`s for sure
I feel bad, but maybe I should have done it earlier
Although you were always the king of my dreams
Soon I`ll go away from your slaughtered body 
Even more I wanna be here forever
My acts can`t offer me a normal life like everyone.
But everything is changing in life
Psychical limits are getting closer suffocating
Undiminished passion, so ferocious 
Is changing logic to madness
