Music & lyrics: Embury
Innocence -
a painful reminescene
Of what was not
And will never be.
Meant not for me.
An unjust war
On the futile.
Chorus:
Bludgeoning my affection wide open
Cries of overkill.
Bludgeoning my affection wide open
Cries of overkill.
Scraps of memories
Flung from our master's table.
A plan I'm sure to disable.
Allegiance to none other.
Allegiance to none other.
Chorus
Renegate a healing catharsis
That bursts, meaningless.
Renegate a healing catharsis
That bursts, meaningless.
Graceful - selfish will,
The chilling thrill,
A play on the nerves to end "all serves".
As penance
To a man's drying tear,
My leer but deny ourselves.
Graceful - a selfish will,
The chilling thrill,
A play on the nerves to end "all serves"
As penance
To a man's drying tear,
My leer but deny ourselves.
Renegate a healing catharsis
That bursts, meaningless.
Renegat a healing catharsis
That bursts, meaningless.
