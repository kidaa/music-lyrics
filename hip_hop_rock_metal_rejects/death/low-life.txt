Lyrics: C.Schuldiner; Music: C.Schuldiner/J.Murphy/T.Butler
Those who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leaches all around
Looking superior is what they believe
Fake is a world you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie
Low life - that's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - that's what you like to see
Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life
Solo : Murphy, Shuldiner, Murphy, Shuldiner, Murphy, Shuldiner
A pathetic excuse for a human being
Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought
Thinking you fool the world,
Into seeing something you are not
Repeat 2nd verse
