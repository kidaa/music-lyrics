At the time of birth
Minds free from suspicion
Senses raped
Induced with superstition
A pre-set mode
To benefit description
Language, colour
Race definition
Inner strength must detect
The love we each possess
Before we may reach
Appreciating it in anyone else
External distinctions
Used as scapegoats to problems
Channeling our aggression
In the wrong direction
Break down the barriers
That enforce superstition
Learn to trust
Overcome suspicion
Acceptance, the weapon
Active against our freedom
Our love and compassion
Held at treason
Rise above induced superstition
