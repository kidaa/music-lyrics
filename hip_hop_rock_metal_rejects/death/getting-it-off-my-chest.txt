I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Sick and tired of all the promises that I make to you
And I break to you
And I know you think you've heard it all before
Something tells me that you think I'm stupid when I say to you
That what I say is true
Too much lyin', too little tryin'

[CHORUS:]
This time is gonna be the last time
The last time again
This time is gonna be the last time
The last time again

Well I don't wanna be redundant anymore
Skippin' like a broken record you can play again
But I'll do it all again
Put it behind me, then you rewind me

[CHORUS]

[guitar solo]

Once again
I must have been
Tryin' to wash away the sin
Cuz I wake up
Bathroom floor
I won't do this anymore
...starting tomorrow

[CHORUS    X 2]
