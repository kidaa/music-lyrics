I try to scrape it off, the thought of skin against skin
And move it from the front to back and started go again
But the depression and time breed and multiply
And I've got more mouths to feed than I could ever
Fit in this auto
You go have a good time
Bring back stories 'cause I will stay behind

So punch the clock, two months are up, and I am stuck down
Against the floor the heat rises out and leaves town
As the depression and time breed and multiply
'Til I've got more mouths to feed than I could ever
Fit in this auto
You go have a good time
Bring back stories 'cause I will stay behind

That's the story of a boy who tried to play it cool
But found it hard to keep it up when you were changing rules
With the depression and time breed and multiply
'Til I've got more mouths to feed than I could ever
Fit in this auto
You go have a good time
Bring back stories 'cause I will stay behind
