What will you do?
What will you do?
Every fool gets a lucky chance or two

I been waitin' for the cards to fall;
To catch all your mistakes
I been watchin' you to see you break

I watched you grow
I saw you fall again and again
You'd cut your knees
You'd start to bleed
But wouldn't let the pain in
You let the dogs bite at your ankles
Let the sunshine burn your eyes
But will you just walk away this time?

I'll watch you crumble into sand
If the right shows mercy
I'll use the left hand
