It's a backwards attraction to your forward eyes
But you're so far-sighted that you can't place trust
In what or who you recognize
We sped the plymouth cross the banks of the mississippi river
Mary timony was smaller then a super ball...
Chitter-chatter all these secrets started giving me the shivers
Plain and simply broken down near olympia
I think your bruise was understanded,
'cause you can't feel this anymore
It's getting bluer and you can't keep faking
That you can't feel this anymore
