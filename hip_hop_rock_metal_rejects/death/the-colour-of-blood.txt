Creatures born in darkness
and the dampness of the earth
cast in stone and hidden
by the lords of another world...
The legions who await
yearn to have this world
when the words spoken by their master
awaken their restless slumber...
Stones crack and bleed
their hatred is unleashed
with black wings they soar
to an unknowing world below
tearing flesh from skull
disemboweling man
feeding on the glistening organs
of the children of a "god"...
Creatures born in darkness
nightmares derived from the haunts of man
reaping fields of human flesh
running red with blood...
Humanity on a cross
and nalled to the earth
humanity to be served
as food for a master race...
