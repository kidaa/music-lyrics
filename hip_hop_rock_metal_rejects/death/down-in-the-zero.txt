Music: Embury, Lyrics: Embury
Burning - feel the pain sear
Pathless - animation nears
Download delinguent fears
Sit back - enjoy the rot!
Down in the zero
Dilemma trebles
To balance - erratic stance
Behind eyes hide a fascist prance
Down in the zero
Now we perish as we bury
Down in the zero
Beyond the point of breaking
Down on level zero
Vexed - the reasons
Unheard like a muted scream
Forced in to an action
Trauma-faked perception
Bindly-placed affection
Strange-faced deception
There's nothing for no-one
