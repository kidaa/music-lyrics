We were drunk and carsick when we rolled into town pulling up to the drive-in there was no one around when the lights unfolded from the sky we were the only ones to be found they were soaring through the sky we were left on the ground. sitting in the living room the dog is catching caramel corn i never wanted a change brushing teeth and combining i guess they do this everywhere i guess it's time for a change i never wanted a change i think it's time for a change.
