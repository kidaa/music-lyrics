[V1:]
The deeper you get, the farther you fall down
The closer I get, the more you dissolve

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're lost inside, your pale addictions
Bury you, with the demons in the ash

[Chorus:]
Can't heal you, don't want to
cause you can't save your-fuckin'-self
Can't heal you, don't need to
cause you won't save yourself

[V2:]
You are the one who made the decision
stuck in a prison, shattered and broken
I am the one who, expected to heal you, save you from drowning in your endless nightmare
Blessed be, the disillusioned
The banished misfit and the cursed hollow son

[Chorus:]
Can't heal you, I don't want to
cause you can't save yourself
Can't help you, don't need to
cause you won't save yourself

[Pre-Chorus:]
We're taught to perish but fade away
Become the haunted and die as slaves

[Chorus:]
Can't heal you, I don't want to
cause you can't save yourself
Can't help you, don't need to
cause you won't save yourself
Can't heal you, don't want to
cause you can't save your-fuckin'-self
Can't heal you, don't need to
cause you won't save yourself
