Fourteen years have passed since that day
Your stories are the same but the ends have all changed
You carried on like you were some type of god
Some things will never change

We went home to see our folks
We laughed and we told jokes
It was like we were young again
On that deathbed our mother lay
How long she's got they still can't say
It took all this to get us back together again

How long is this going to last
You can't keep reliving your past
Screwing over the ones that you lone
In the name of some new drug
So brother, raise another pint
Rev up the engine and drive off in the night
See you somewhere some place some time
I know there's better brothers but you're the only one that's mine
I know there's better brothers but you're the only one that's mine

The bondsman came to my door early the next day
He said "I come lookin' for you brother 
You don't know what kind of trouble that he's in"

How long is this going to last
You can't keep reliving your past
Johnny law keeps a poundin' at my door
'Cause you screwed up some new score

So he's standing in the doorway like he owns the place
With a look of smug satisfaction on his face
I'm gonna give you up
Of that he's sure as hell
But I take one look at him and I know I'll never tell

So brother, raise another pint
Rev up the engine and drive off in the night
See you somewhere some place some time
I know there's better brother's but you're the only one that's mine

So brother, raise another pint
Rev up the engine and drive off in the night
I still look out for you no matter what you heard.
They can knock all of my doors down but I won't say a word.
They can knock all of my doors down but I won't say a word.

Fourteen years have passed since that day and still nothing has changed.
