Music & lyrics: Embury
Played out, wide off the mark,
Mania develops,
Akin ti fiction,
More than to a world of fact.
Chorus:
My own worst enemy.
My own worst enemy.
Lifes foul treachery.
My own worst enemy.
Dams of emotions build
A dull and trubid screen,
Clouding veils of black
In jungles of hopes opressed.
Chorus
So many times,
For no reason.
So many promised punches,
For what reason?
Ceaseless decay,
Parallel obscene and flagrant.
Ceaseless decay,
Restrained my mind coils.
So many times,
For no reason.
So many promised punches,
For what reason?
Ceaseless decay,
Parallel obscene and flagrant.
Ceaseless decay,
Restrained my mind coils.
Played out, wide off the mark,
Mania develops,
Akin to fiction,
More than to a world of fact.
My own worst enemy.
My own worst enemy.
Life foul treachery.
