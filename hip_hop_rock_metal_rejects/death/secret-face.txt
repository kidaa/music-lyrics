There is a mask
That covers up one's true intentions
Once romoved,things become very clear
Analyze behavior patterns to see beneath
The person that is presented to you
Vulnerable through trust
Life is twisted mase of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face
Solo: Schuldiner
What's on the outside
Is not always all that is real
Live by caution,what is feel
When things are reversed
People are shown for what they are
The truth is revealed
Banish the false
Pacifying moments with an acquired disguise to obtain
The things they want
By the anguish of someone else
Materialistic motives are fulfilled
Cherish the true
Vulnerable through trust
Life is twisted mase of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face
