His hand spells death
He breathes his vile breath
No way you can stop him once he's out
He hauts you sleep
In the tub he hides down deep
He rips your face and no one hears you shout

CHORUS-
He's come for you, what will you do
He'll slash you and rip you and cut you in two

His teeth are black
Flex metal knuckles with a crack
Maggots crawling all throughout his skin
He'll get them all
Everyone will hear his call
When the razors grip beneath their chinCHORUS-MOSH PART
As the blood begins to splat
On his sweater and his hat
His rotted mouth smiles as you die
His color's red and green
His skin's not what it seems
He rips at it and tears off his own flesh

CHORUS
