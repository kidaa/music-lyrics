Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!
Day so dark, full of dust
You stand out and watch out
You work so hard, here right now
You run for you life
And you know where they come
Bombs falling down
Every day and every night
You stand out in fire
Rivets fall, all explode
Come and bring you down
Crying out, all of you
Fight them for your rights
And you know where they come
Bombs falling down
Every day and every night
You stand out in fire
You stand on the road and try for freedom, you all
Fight for your right and long as you live, you fight
Don't let them pry you from each people, don't do
Let the fire burn for you and ever - ha, ha, ha
And you know where they come
Bombs falling down
Every day and every night
You stand out in fire
You stand on the road and try for freedom, you all
Fight for your right as long as you live, you fight
Don't let them pry you from each people, don't do
Let the fire burn for you and ever - give it all
