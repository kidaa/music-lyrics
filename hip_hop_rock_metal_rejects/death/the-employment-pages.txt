We spread out and occupy the cracks in the urban streets.
Idle now... i rearrange the furniture as you sleep.
It's so appropriate... the way we amplify the sound,
And then the neighbors drop by and they ask us to turn it down again...
We spread out and everyone is frightfully more aware.
So impressed... the cocktail polotics and obscure details.
And it was true that i was truly failing.
But you were gone and i wass home calling around but nothing was found worthwhile.
