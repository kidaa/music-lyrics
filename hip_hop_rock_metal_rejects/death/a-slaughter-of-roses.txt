Demolition of bodies, smashed and broken,
piles of guts, moist and steaming
Tendons severing, brains are boiling, unburied
corpses in state of decay
Rotten limbs start to ferment, torso's torn in
two
Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue,
butchered for human stew
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way
through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards is
enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your
mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving
nothing but bones
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of
death fill the air
Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets, blood
spurting everywhere
Victim lying dead, neck but no head, smearing
remains on your own face
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of
death fill the air
Blistering flesh, another death, stiffened bones,
morbid groans
Evil minds, brains oozing slime, feel the pain
Body weak brain contorting, fluid flowing from
your organs
Veins torn out, Mangled
Festering flesh, quivering cadaver, ligaments
stretched around your own neck
Drink the puss, Mangled
Severed dick, bloody bowels, the gutted corpse
now lies hollow
Feeding on feces, Mangled
Amputated arms, crushing legs, head is ripped
right off your shoulders
Thrown in a pile, Mangled
Limbs rearranged, head on backwards a
humongous heap of twisted flesh
Sewn together, Mangled-Mangled
His knife plunges in, your cold battered body
Blood seeping through, the jagged wounds the
cuts
Unbearable pain, give into death
Your life slips away, perish in blood
Menacing madman mutilating
Destroying disfiguring, dead you'll be
Crushing cracking killing you
Annihilation, desecration
Born through modern day science
Man has made his last mistake
A creature so hideously horrible
Leaving nothing to waste
Evil has a new face, a mangled horrible face
His views are those of death, nothing will stop
his lust
Slicing victims left to decay, listening to their
mortal cries
Unhuman, immortal, bestial, now he owns
your soul
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way
through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards is
enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from
your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving
nothing but bones
Human converted to beast, the perfect killing
machine
Psychotic structure of brain tissue, murder his
only memory
Dependant on death, crushing your head, I'm
addicted to blood
Chew the decay
The weakened man must die, tearing out his
insides
Smashing all the bones, hear his tormenting
groans
