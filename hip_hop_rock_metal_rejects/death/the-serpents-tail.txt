Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Ride, ride em Jewboy,
Ride em all around the old corral.
I'm, I'm with you boy
If I've got to ride six million miles.

Now the smokes from camps are rising
See the helpless creatures on their way.
Hey, old pal, ain't it surprising
How far you can go before you stay.

Don't you let the morning blind ya
When on your sleeve you wore the yeller star.
Old memories still live behind ya,
Can't you see by your outfit who you are.

How long will you be driven relentless round the world,
The blood in the rhythm of the soul.

Wild ponies all your dreams were broken,
Rounded out and made to move along.
The loneliness which can't be spoken
Just swings a rope and rides inside a song.

Dead limbs play with ringless fingers
A melody which burns you deep inside.
Oh, how the song becomes the singers,
May peace be ever with you as you ride.

How long will you be driven relentless around the world,
The blood in the rhythm of the soul.

In the window candles glowing
Remind you that today you are a child,
Road ahead, forever rolling,
And anything worth cryin' can be smiled.

So ride, ride em Jewboy,
Ride em all around the old corral.
I'm, I'm with you boy
If I've got to ride six million miles.

Ooh ooh ooh,
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Ooh ooh ooh,
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
