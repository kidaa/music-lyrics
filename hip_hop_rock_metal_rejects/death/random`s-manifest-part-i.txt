music: Nick, Costas lyrics: Nick
Pressing my hands against my head
Trying to hear my heartbeats
I know that I don`t know
Only tomorrow knows
Life is a raging sea, no scedule, no turning back
I`m thinking what the others do
If they exist at nights
When I`m lying in bed
Life is shifting like the cloud
Mixed colors clear my mind, one year later I`m back
Seeing eyes I haven`t seen before
Space is getting shorter for me and them
Fate is working for what is written
