Adapting to different surroundings
Changing views day by day
Too critical of others
When you too are at fault
Several sets of opinions
Like colours to camouflage yourself
Like a fox sly in your manoeuvres
Too soon you'll get caught unawares
Sometimes I feel pity
Sometimes I feel hatred ...
Sometimes you're my friend
Sometimes you're my enemy
I'll never give you the satisfaction
Of knowing how I feel
