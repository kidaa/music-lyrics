Psychical crushes-made for a human
Insistently are searching for cure
A desperate being is trying to escape from destiny
of loneliness and sorrow
Obvious agony on daily steps
Incorrigibly romantic inner picture-furthered in all dimensions
Words are loosing their interest told by well-disposed-aimed on
Happiness restoring
Inexperienced wandering in areas of fantastic, false or true
Annihilation is possible-perceivable
In glossy spaces seem to be true
Obvious agony on daily steps
Incorrigibly romantic inner picture-furthered in all dimensions
Words are loosing their interest told by well-disposed-aimed on
Aimed on fear`s mollifyness-happiness restoring. 
The deceive so easy but so false in view
Theories everywhere, deeds, facts-they come and leave
Psychical transactions without any limits simple in the light
Maybe hard in the dark but always murderous 
Is it real that lifeless have bigger value
Just because civility is teaching the decay
You, foolish spirit, possessed by matter`s haughtiness
When will you stop searching around?
When will you learn to live and exist limited in small scopes
Far away from hesitations and freedom-so far away
Till the day you`ll learn the way to kill the corruption existing around you?
chorus
SENSE OF ANNIHILATION-the touch with all around 
Leading to intricate ideas, sweet in deed 
Killing is at last out of law
Without hesitations or fear, so simple, so easy
Violence, psycho-violence stated our existence
Bringing the mortals nearer to inexistence`s worship 
We have taught at last our murder
Leading ourselves to termination
The Human High-school is now teaching
How to kill naturally everything it`s worth to be in heart
Far away of matter and flesh
