Politicians preaching -on TV

Saying nothing but -vote for me

Everybody, everywhere

We got a love, got a love

Got a love we gotta share...

One better world

One better world

One better, better, better world

Papers feeding -lies each day

Are you believing -what they say?

Pulpit preachers -selling God

Making big bucks -is that enough?

Everybody, everywhere

We got a love, got a love

Got a love we gotta share...

One better world

One better world

One better, better, better world

Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere

let the lion lie down with the lamb

Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere

Don't use the colour of his skin to judge the man

Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere

Does it matter if you're gay or if you're straight?

Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere

If it does you fill this world with hate

Underneath a flag

Love is just a name

But underneath the moon

We are all the same

Every boy, every girl

Everybody, everywhere

We got a love, got a love

Got a love we gotta share...

One better world

One better world

One better, better, better world
