Born into darkness
Where sounds portray the imagess that are out
Out of reach from my sight
Which hes been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away
In dreams my throughs take their form
To give memories identity
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound
Solo: Schuldiner
Close your eyes and imagine to be without
What we take for granted every time we open our eyes
A permanent shadow to never step away
Feel the dark in the cold
Feel the warmth of the light
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away
In dreams my throughs take their form
To give memories identity
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound
