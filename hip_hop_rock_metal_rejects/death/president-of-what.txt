I saw the scene unfold on a rainy Sunday
Creases indicating folds that kept four walls from caving in
I took a little more of what I take for granted
And filled my plate with fear that gears would turn
And wheels would roll away

Something's got to break you down [x2]

Entered the scene I'm told on I think it was Monday
You drove straight through and mined that quarry
For all it could bleed 'til dry
I took a little more 'til I got taken for granted
'cause beautiful boys gave chase
And when they arch your backbone
It's such a dreadful sight

Something's got to break you down [x2]

[x2]
I'll react when faces find you
With jealous fits that gag and bind you
'cause nothing hurts like nothing at all
When imagination takes full control

I saw the scene unfold [x4]
