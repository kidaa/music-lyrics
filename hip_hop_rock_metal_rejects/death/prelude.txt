Music: Pintado, Lyrics: Embury
Last chance to escape
Shall I forsake all that I can take to carry on
Insanity slips away
Greeting the new day
Believing is kneeling
Ignore what i'm feeling
The pressure of living is taking it's toll
Regrets that i'm thinking
The hope that we're sharing is a lost cause
Mishappen
Thought i'd lost
Caressing chaos drops
Prelude to a drowning, burning vision
Pointless, selfish
Half the time I can't remember any
Of the childish lies
Suppressing unwanted thoughts
Expressing my only choice
