R. Cavestany
No choice
I had to do it
Or else it was my ass on the floor
I had to even up the score
So I shot down the bloody
Now I have to face my destiny
No hope for me in a biased society
Chorus
Sinner - I'm innocent
Repent - So sorry
Die - No please
Guilty of innocence
My only crime was being at the scene
All fingers point at me
Things aren't as they seem
Chorus
Here I sit and wonder why
You constantly must classify
The way I think
The way I look
But I don't really give a
'Cause you don't mean a thing to me
And this is what I fail to see
Now I have to go to jail
'Cause I can't afford the bail
Judge and jury sure they were fair
Laughing as they cut my hair
Chorus
