Lyrics Greenway - Music Harris, Mitch
Reasoning poison in the vein
Chasing the dragon who's frying your brain
The shit that once gave you the high
Now controls your escape from proverbial cloud nine
Sad dependancy - Brainfried society
Mindsnare
All essence of being in turmoil
Your white powder god brings life to the boil
Forget all you family and friends
Heroin becomes guardian till the end
Jack-up
Its powers of deception
Seems to null all daily strain
But just another fix
Grip on reality fades out day by day
