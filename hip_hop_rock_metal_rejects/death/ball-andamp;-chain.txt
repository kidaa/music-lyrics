When I fall, I fall hard.
My body bruises at your touch,
my ankles bear these lover's scars.
The weight is heavy, but necessary.
You'll never change my ball and chain.

My ball and chain you will remain.
You've always been my ball and chain.

She lingers somewhere I cannot find.
My lover stands upon the shore,
it's me she should be waiting for.
The distance binds us locked in twain.
You will remain my ball and chain.

My ball and chain you will remain.
You've always been my ball and chain.

My ball and chain you will remain.
You've always been my ball and chain
