Summer's gone, I overslept and woke up to the chill of fall. 
Overworked and now I'm all used up 

This TV haze sucks me through I watch the world from the inside 
Overworked and now I'm all used up 

Final drag fills my lungs and makes me high 
They fill up as I bottom out 
Steering wheels watch them driving with someplace to go 
I'd steer myself, but I don't have a route. 

Working on demand, no ice cream man, beaches filled with sand. 
While the TV trays wasted Summer days, slowly slippin' away 

But you're so little, Hell, the days are slow, and I'm down inside 
I'll have to go you're so little, Hell, when months are slow, and I'm down inside 

Summer's gone, I overslept and woke up to the chill of fall 
Overworked and now I'm all used up. 

This TV haze sucks me through I watch the world from the inside 
Overworked and now I'm all used up 

Working on demand, no ice cream man, beaches filled with sand. 
While the TV trays wasted Summer days, slowly slippin' away 

But you're so little, Hell, the days are slow, and I'm down inside 
I'll have to go you're so little, Hell, when years are slow, and I'm down inside 

I'm down inside, I'm down inside, I'm down inside.
