Lumpy, chunky, smells kinda funky
Addicted to the sickness I'm a toe jam junkie
Pull it out your toes, not out of your behind
Toe cheese goes well with a fine wine
Store it in a pickle jar, keep it in the pantry
Collecting all your jam makes your house look fancy
Scam all your jam as you jam to the beat
Dig deep into your big pteradactyl feet
And scrape it out, chisle, even polish it too
Toe jam, toe cheese, maybe even tofu
Take the real thing, not the imitation scam
Get into your feet and get into the jam
