In the dark of night...
Abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping
And some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy -
Unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condodned

Solo: schuldinger
It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence
This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done
Chorus:
There will be zero tolerance
For the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance
Fate is your decicing god
Solo: schuldinger / solo: koelble
Karma comes crashing down
Leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the
Source of verbal whore
Machines supply the altar
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed
Solo: koelble
It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence
This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done
