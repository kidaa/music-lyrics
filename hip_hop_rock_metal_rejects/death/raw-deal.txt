There's a shred of guilt in every one of us
And a pain we felt in watching you all suffer
Now the time has come 
To make amends
To everyone 
To pay the price
For all that we could've done
But we wasted everything now
Now we're done.
Now we're done.

I preyed on my own people
I took them for all that they had
I laughed at their helplessness
I left them for dead
Now I'm tugging on this line
But I can never gain any ground
And for the selfishness I displayed
There is a punishment that I've found
