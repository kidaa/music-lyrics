Now get back, give me slack from the entonement pit
'Cause the Sudden Death-Honeynut conglomerate
Is fuelin' the fire for the monster jam
I'm movin' the masses with the mic in my hand and
Pinch-hittin' as it's writtin' rockin' hip hop top charts
Combust spontaneous rhymes, I'll recall you like lawn darts
I got cues from the Devo Spice
To be positive, my dynamite cranks what's nice
Godzilla, the lizard king is not whack
So funkin' bad he'll break the back of a Sleestak
And cause chaos when I'm done make it hectic
In fact you can't estimate how bad that I wreck it
Insane book knowledge give me stupid vocab
Vacuum sealed head and my gab don't go bad
Rappin' sniper you can bet I'm hyper
I'm drawin' a crowd like my man the Pied Piper
Zippedy-pippedy-do-dah, zippidely-d-o-a
My oh my that's crazy lyrics to say
And when I DJ I'm more like the Darth Vader
'Cause I cut it up right with my light saber fader
You don't think it's gonna last, it does bet your ass
That's why the floor boards shakin' low frequency blasts
I pillage and I plunder like the Hun Atilla
Or the freak Godzilla.

Godzilla, the killer, don't press your luck
From the depths of beyond comes a power of destruction
Panic as I have it wreakin' havoc on the street
Shakin' ground from the sound of the poundin' of my feet
And the beat the crushes all the backbones burns
Leavin' suckers out of luck stuck dead on the curb
The monster beat, with my monster breath
Means I'm sending all the men to an impending sudden death
Spice, the vox on the box
I'm allergic to the nuts, but Honeynut rocks
Leaving what I do true to the heart when I start
I just do what I gotta do and rip it all apart
Stuck in my basement I'm breakin' out hard
'Cause the noise of my toys can destroy the front yard
I summon up the bass and I send it on a rampage
Read about the beat tomorrow morning on the front page
And cower at the sound of my growl
As I howl you'll hit the ground 'cause my breath is so foul
I wreck everything in my way every day
Take a building I don't like and redesign it my way
You can hear me comin' for miles around
Get in my way I'll beat you down you won't last a whole round
Meet ya and I treat ya and I'm guaranteed to thrill ya
Because I'm hung like Godzilla
