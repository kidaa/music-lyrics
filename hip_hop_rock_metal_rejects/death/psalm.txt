I once loved a lady who did change into a child
I saw the light of day shine in her eyes
I loved her like a baby and I raised her to the sky
It seems the light of day did pass me by
Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
But I can't say if she ever thinks of me
If I were of the ocean
Or a wave upon the sand
Or just a drop of water in her hand
A pebble or a broken shell
A rock upon the shore
I doubt if I could love her any more
Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
And I can't say if she ever thinks of me
No I can't say if she ever thinks of me
