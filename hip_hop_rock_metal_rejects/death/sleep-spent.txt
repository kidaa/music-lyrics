I can't expel the truth
It's much more than i thought i could do
And with time my worth with stain
And split your heart from my name...
So drive away your mouth from my ears
And waste a day so i can think clearly
And what's left to wait for here
As my hands sleep spent this last year
Choking the bottle's neck that pulled you from my bed
