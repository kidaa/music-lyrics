I have just died or so they say
was it mere fate? or have they lied...
To welcome death, the would have me burn,
scatter my remains and take what is mine.
They tie me to a cold slab, wire my jaws shut,
the oven is heated, my body shoved in...
No mercy in thair eyes, for I'm not dead.
They close the door to lock, my life is too fate...
My skin begins to burn and melt
it slides from muscle and bone.
My insides burst from within me
the smell of my body cooked...
I endure the burning pain
tear open my mouth to scream
I feel my brain explode
I'm consumed in death as flames!
