Lyrics Embury/Greenway - Music Harris, Mick
Forced exposure to create what is expected
To face neglection is the price no-one wants to pay
Line in line, stereotypes perpetrated
Similarity of negativity
The chains that bind us grow stronger
Break away from the pack of mindless dogs
Taste the scent, realise ambition
Life - a stagnant lair in which to lie
Taste the scent, realise ambition
A label to some, habits preset
Faction alienation, bias hold the key
