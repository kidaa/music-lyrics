Within the thin light of every dawn
I see a future which I know I`ll miss
I see joy on faces of children and men
I hear all sounds even the snake`s hiss
Beyond the cell bars that keep me from you
Remorse is my heaven and fate so strong 
And I repent for ever more
Soon I`ll be no more I think it`s for the best 
I`ve done my deeds and wrong I`ll pay
But I see the dawn
This thought drives me mad but I wan to feel
For the last time how a free child laughs
Within dawn`s dim light I see forgiveness and serenity
A purple vain over my sins, but I pay mine and I`ll pay yours
Before my ending that frees you from me-remorse is
Remorse is my heaven and fate is so closed-oh so closed
And I repent for ever more
Strange words-maybe make you feel 
like this man out there, like the man
Who stands in the beginning of a tale, a tale which seems to be
As honest like a child`s kiss
