Music: Embury, Lyrics: Embury
Banish the emotion
Severing the ties
Mutual agressions
Multiply inwind
Reason lost is reason gained
Reluctance seeping through the rage
Accetance changing on all fronts
Phase me out... i've reached my lowpoint
Tarnished with the motion
Voids in which we hide
Excuse pales from pressure
Desperate thoughts collide
Confessions, protection - the facts distort
Frenetic eccentric acts are caught
Phase me out
Relentless, contagion - a single choice
Dissecting, mutating - the single voice
