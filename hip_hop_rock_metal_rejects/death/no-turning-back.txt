The atmosphere is breaking up
Sunlight starts to burn my skin
Losing weight but I swell
Wish I'd die and leave this hell
Cannot stop no turning back
Rays that burn my front and back
Our solar death that we deserve
For being ignorant with our world

CHORUS-
We will die, we will fry
We never learn, so now we burnThe time has come to start again
But first we all must see the end
By hand of god or man
To oblibion we descend
I think that this is understood
Wouldn't stop it if I could
Time for the human race to die
And give this world a chance to thrive

CHORUS
