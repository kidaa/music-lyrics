D. Pepa, R. Cavestany
They didn't used to be this way
In the beginning
Not to put up a front
It's just the way they are
Enter the human race
But no one's winning
You do what you can
This is what they believe
Chorus
Road mutants crushing all
They rise while others fall
Laughing in your faces
They smell like death
So hold your breath
Their skin starts to peel
Sucking moisture off the surface
Causing wounds that wait heal
In the night there is no light
The time is right to have fun
Perspiration is no question
When you're caught by the sun
You feel their presence miles away
You feel them coming
Not too quick to arrive
That's their style
But when they finally hit the stage
There's nothing left to say
The real world goes away
Escape for awhile
Chorus
They smell like death
So hold your breath
It's time to get down
You can spot them from a distance
Cause they're not from your town
The road mutants love to
Have a good time
When we're gone
You can't erase the scar on your mind
Chorus
