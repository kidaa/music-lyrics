Music: Embury, Harris; lyrics: Greenway
Bite the bit, scream till you're blue the face. x4
Nice pipe dreams or passive revolution? x4
Foot soldiers
With weapons of placarde and banners.
How will they stop the rot?
No standing to reason,
'cause reason is treason -
It doesn't feasible.
No standing to reason,
'cause reason is treason -
It doesn't feasible.
Lie down.
And cry all you can.
The machine rolls over you.
No standing to reason,
'cause reason is treason -
It doesn't feasible.
No standing to reason,
'cause reason is treason -
It doesn't feasible.
It just  don't seem feasible - no!
Black to the NAzi - try pleading affinity
Hands up, boot in, shattering the passive dream.
But is it right to tolerate this fucked democratic process? - no!
Shattering the passive dream
Is it 'cause we like to hear the sound of our voice?
Big-hearted diatribes, just like my dilemma.
Time to return compliments, shattering the passive dream?
