Trapped inside a life which is not yours
Spirits within causing terror, fear and dark
Evil dead
Evil dead
Voice speaks out, all will die tonight
Insanity fills your mind, you hear them calling
Evil dead
Evil dead
Covered in blood, all hope is lost
Forever to rot, controlled by the powers of the
Evil dead
Evil dead
