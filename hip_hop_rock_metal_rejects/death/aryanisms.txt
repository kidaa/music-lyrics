Put it on yourself to be
A role model, an image that you feel
Should guide the habits, to form a movement of self-infatuated fools.
Keeping "Each to their own", where social bonding is taboo
Is it nice to be a clone in your interpretation of a perfect world,
Where all desire to consort is perceived as contagious disease.
Keeping "Each to their own", where social bonding is taboo
Challenge the sordid claims to purify!
Your distinction threatened? - Absurd!!
You wage crusades of loathing to prove a point - the need for divide,
How can the thought of unbounded relations kindle so much hate - outcast!!
Get your kicks through persecution.
Used as scapegoats for your exterior doubts.
Exposing weakness - retarded, unworthy.
I cannot begin to comprehend how you wear such shame with vigour -
Homophobic race antagonist.
Harmony can only flourish with mutual regard.
