Well the bombs are ringin'
Like bells at a wedding
And the whole sky fills with dust
We'll get outta this town
Alive or in the ground
We'll poke a hole through the clouds
To breath if we must

Ooohhh tonight is the night
For the moon in June
It is so bright
Steal away steal away tonight

Well your momma and your papa
They don't like me too much
I've got a dark streak in my ways
But you and me we'll stick together
We're two birds of a feather
We'll be together till the end of days

Ooohhh tonight is the night
For the moon in June
It is so bright
Steal away steal away tonight

Well the locks are old
And these bars are rusted
This is no place for us to die
Before the seas boil over
And the wind and the water
Make a grave for you and I
'Cause we gotta get out of this place

Ooohhh tonight is the night
For the moon in June
It is so bright
Steal away steal away to--
Ooohhh ooohhh ooohhh
