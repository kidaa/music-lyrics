i've got a brand new girlfriend

i've got a new ex-girlfriend
she is so fat and ugly
oh not you again it gets worse
everytime and one plus two again

well i let it go, i don't care
i love you when you're not there
brand new song just for you
i'm not sorry about the things i
do
i've got a brand new song
it is so happy happy
i've got a brand new attitude
it is so hateful hateful

everytime

let it go i don't
care
i love you when you're not there
brand new song just for you i'm so sorry

that it's so easy to forget it

regret it,
well i let it go,
