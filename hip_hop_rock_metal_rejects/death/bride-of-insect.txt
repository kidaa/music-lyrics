Go beyond what is wrong
to an abomination
or normal morality
to what the brain cannot percieve.
Go beneath the world
to where there's movement in the dark
taste the water where vermin play
she is breeding...
A father caresses his daughter's vagina
and brings the taste to his lips
Intercourse follows foreplay
soon the girl will give birth...
Go into a room that is dark
to an abomination
that's lying in a shadowed corner
a young child that has just given birth.
And from her vagina: a viscous trail
which leads to movement in the black beneth her bed
and that's where you find her sac
and from her sac her flat-bodied children crawl...
The father caresses his daughters vagins
he finds movement between her lips-
his bastard children of his bride of insect
and the insects taste their father's flesh...
