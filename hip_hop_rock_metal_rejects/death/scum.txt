He can see off into the future
He knows what's going on
So when he says there's a place there for her
You know he can't be wrong

Now when she comes she comes in full effect
No regrets - and everything she wants she gets
She's Going out with God
She ain't gonna let me forget
She's Going out with God

Look at all of the people round here
He put them where they are
he's the one they all love and they fear
a real superstar

Now when she comes...

He's got his fingers in everything
He built the world from dust
And he can pull all of your puppet strings
He's got your faith and trust

Now when she comes...

Oh yeah she's Going out with God
