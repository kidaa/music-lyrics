I woke up, can't wait to eat
Got my cereal, boy was I beat
Opened the fridge, and to my dismay
There was no milk, my mother will pay

CHORUS-
I want some milk, my coffee grows cold
I want some milk, I should've been told

BRIDGE-
I wish I had some god damn milk
My Cheerios just ain't the same
I wish I had some god damn milk
Too bad the milkman never cameI can't go out to the store
I'll just wait till my mother buys more
I'll just have wheat thins and beer
If I get sick, the toilet is near

CHORUS-BRIDGE-CHORUS
