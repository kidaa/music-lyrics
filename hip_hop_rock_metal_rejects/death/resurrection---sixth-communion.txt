I'm going crazy,
Everytime that I see you hold somebody's hand,
It's not the jealousy baby,
I can't hide,
'Cause I don't think you understand.

I'm like a river,
That runs for you,
Through the valleys of a troubled land, troubled land,
And if you wonder when good times will come to you,
I promise you I'll understand.

'Cause if you believe in one love only,
And no one can see the good in you,
Just call my name,
I'll come running,
I will be waiting for you waiting for you.

I might seem crazy to my friends,
But I speak from my experience, experience,
'Cause what computers and money never can,
Is exactly what makes you a man.

So if you believe in one love only,
And no one can see the good in you,
Just call my name, call my name
I'll come running, I'll come running
I will be waiting for you waiting for you

'Cause if you believe in one love only,
And no one can see the good in you, I can see, I can see, oh I can see
Just call my name, just call babe
I'll come running, I'll come running
I will be waiting for you

One love only
And nothing else matters, one love
When it's real love that you find that you find,
We're gonna keep it together, one love only
Until the end of time.

'Cause if you believe in one love only, one love only
And no one can see the good in you, no one can see
Just call my name, call my name
I'll come running, I'll come running,
I will be waiting for you waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for

'Cause if you believe in one love only, one love only
And no one can see the good in you, no one can see
Just call my name,
I'll come running,
I will be waiting for you waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for

Just call my name, call my name
I'll come running,
I will be waiting for you.
