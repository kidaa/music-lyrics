music: Dennis, Jake lyrics: Jake
Oh mist! This pneumatic mist which exterminates
Brutally dreams and exceptions 
Resistance can be corrupted so easy no one could hope
Oh no- no one could hope!
chorus
Mother says life is Godly present
But it hurts you so much, especially in your loneliness
Or if you try to get consoled- consoled in hard times
Using yourself been aggrieved 
Happines`s song isn`t sung anymore
Retrying for it could be funny
Living in sorrow for ever, and always remembering the lost
And everything which won`t exist again
The blood runs fast-fast in veins following the heartbeats 
Feel your nerves-feel your nerves strained feel your mind in pain
Some tears flow, maybe elements of love-maybe elements
Of love hate or sorrow
The pain dominates when the fist breaks the pane of glass
The anger becomes bigger, the cries so woeful 
Some times of tranquillity are enough
Before next bursting out which maybe deliver forever
IN SORROW!!!
