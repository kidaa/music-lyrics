Let me relate you to something
Maybe a piece of myself
I`m so lonely- I don`t know why
I don`t know why I feel so much aversion for those I look alike
Feel so much aversion for those I look alike
How foolish a man can be
Closing my eyes I recollect remembering those Glory Days
Looking for something different, intact, extravagant 
Leading me to entireness
It`s so difficult to overtake the time lying on to your dreams
But more difficult is to find one to trust in good and bad times
I made the final mistake
To believe everything around me as true
Betraying my secrets to the Wrong
I got to be their slave
Like a fading flower I feel to myself 
to be as pure as them
My only acquisition along with the black thoughts 
Was my own flesh
Isolation-the only way to escape
Betraying dreams and myself
And now, living lonely in this town
I try to live again screaming silently for my lost dreams
