Pushed, promoted, justified?
Perhaps not guaranteed.
Reassuring cash transfer providing leads,
Media profile - fallacies we need?
I think not!
Labels breed the money making rock machines.
Broadening mind, eyes blind.
Criticism for the masses - or for themselves?
Progression of procession?
Do opinions count or do they mount?
The piles of shit,
That the alternative press delights us with.
Critique elite - ill informed.
No wrong can be done, depending on the trend at times to be untrendy.
Unexpired exile,
Reluctantly we all indulge their tasteful hype.
