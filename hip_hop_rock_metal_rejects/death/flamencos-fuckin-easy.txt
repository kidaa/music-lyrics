Life in the city everyone's busy packin' portfolios to kill competition hey boss hey boss i'm capable of making your life easier but i'm drunk on promotions. can i get you some coffee? can i make you some copies? have you seen my resume? i'm a regular go-getter. i'll take the slow life like a cowboy strayin' 'cross the open plains wandering without fear of a monday.
