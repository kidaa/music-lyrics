Lately, lately we haven't been at our best
And maybe, maybe we had it comin' for a long time
Everybody hopes that life is like a dancer's pirouette
With grace we've dodged each conflict and decision that we've met
Everybody tells themselves that they m ust be justified
They do what they do because they're trying to get by

Maybe, maybe we are all selfish
But maybe, maybe it isn't over yet
Everybody hopes that love is like a prairie fire
That sweeps across the field, consumin' it all
That love will never fade or flicker
As pure as the air we breath

We've made mistakes that we can't change
But there's still time to start again
There's still time to start again [x27]
