So much fear in me 
The future that I will never-never see
Happiness is wasted-for ever 
Here, so lonely at the mountain top
Is all this for a better tomorrow?
The shouting the running alienated personalities 
Feel like an idiot to myself
So depressed-so depressed
The engine-sound, so deafening
Above our heads like a God
In desperate moments I run-I run for myself
Hide beneath my shadowhide beneath my shadow
Snakes in my hands, in my red eyes
As it fires its lightening away
My gun no longer protects me-did it ever, I wonder
So depressed, so depressed
It`s better this way
Not to think-not to think again
Why should I-should I live for
Fight again in someone else`s war
The light brings pain, but heals my scars
My skin is re-becoming in a new state of life
Sorrow is behind in the noise of a neverland
Beneath my shadow nothing exist
Nothing exist
