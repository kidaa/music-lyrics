I've taken a hit or two
I've given quite a few
I swing my firsts and the cities all fall

I've broken a law
I reckon I only missed a few
I watch these long days pass through the bars
I curse the brass

I've had a cracked rib or two
I guess I've busted more
I've laid a couple out on the coolin' board

Sometimes you walk the line
And sometimes it walks you
You get quick to anger
Quick to put a knife up to another man's throat
I cannot still the hell that's in these hands

When they came to take me
I didn't fight just let them win
A man died in my cell
Damn the guards sure gave me hell
I'd love to see them horsemen ride 
So law and order stand aside

Oh this woman and gin, woman and gin
Go together like the devil and sin
Her legs are like wheat her lips are like wine
Gonna meet her at the end of the county line

Tonight bring on the floodlights

Boys! Yeah! Fetch the shovel!
Boys! Yeah! Post the lookout!
Coppers! You'll never catch us! That's right!
Ladies, we're coming home tonite!

Cause in a few more yards we'll reach the line
And meet up with a friend of mine
The dogs are comin' swift and mean
But I'm hungrier than they have ever been
