Words: Schuldiner; Music: Schuldiner/Rozz
Freedom is just a breath away
Will you live to see the day
As the heat intensifies
You start to choke, your insides fry
Seizure now sets in
Torture will begin
Twisted bodies lie
Waiting now to die
Choke on it - as your tongue goes down
Choke on it - death is all around
Screaming fills your frenzied mind
No way out no more time
Example made for those to see
Your freedom turned to misery
Word is all around
Of what they have found
Lesson to be learned
You will not return
Choke on it - as your tongue goes down
Choke on it - death is all around
