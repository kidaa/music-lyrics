Got these little pills
To curb your appetite
Take a couple of these
You'll be up all night
I can scream, I can jump, I can shout
I can tear the whole place down
When I take a couple of these
I don't want you around

All tensed up, did too many pills
Wanna get near you but I can't stand still

Baby, I love you, but I'm too loaded
To love you properly
