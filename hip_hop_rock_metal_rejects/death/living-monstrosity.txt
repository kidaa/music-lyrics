Lyrics: C.Schuldiner; Music: C.Schuldiner
Every day blows by in the world of corrupt addiction
With live comes pain withdrawals and deformation
Breaking the mold of human appearance
Contorting bodies with chemical interference
The guilty one, innocent she now cries
A life of Hell, better off to die
Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine
Living monstrosity
A freak for life they'll always be
Never knowing love or hate
Only pain the drug creates
Solo: Murphy, Shuldiner
Some say she's naive, she's a stupid bitch
Some say to forgive, guilty she should die
The beginning of the end begins at birth
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh
An example we should make out of
These creators of misfortune
A serious crime that should not be forgiven
Repeat 2nd verse
