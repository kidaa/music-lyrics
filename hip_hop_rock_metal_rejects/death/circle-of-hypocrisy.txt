Lyrics Greenway - Music Harris, Mick
Talk of unity - a far cry from the slander and rivalry
Why should we encourage what in fact is a circle of hypocrisy
Impulsive jealosy
Where;s the so-called harmony?
Internally untrusting
Externally inspiring
Assume your place above the rest
The wisest of the less
The knowledge you'll never possess
Compensated for with single-mindedness
Bored with life you turn to test
Battleground for pettiness
Pick at flies to justify
Temper's raised - You wonder why?
Why??
Supposedly Accessible
Come support our scene
Just another target
Harassed to the extreme
