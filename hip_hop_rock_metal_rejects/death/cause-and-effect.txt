What are your motives
For your abuse
What can they be?
Accused of things
I've never done
This seems strange
Your motivation, for my humiliation
I'm pressurised
So many times
By your presence
Your very existance
Has become my obsession
My infatuation with your damnation
I experience
Dangerous thoughts
That are all too real
How can one man
Inflict in me
So much hate
My obsession with your destruction
