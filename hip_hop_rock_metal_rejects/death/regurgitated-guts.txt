Suicidal preache hands himself
Unfaithful servant goes straight to hell
When he returns your life will end
Down from the skies maggots descend
Least expecting his horrible face
Your decayed guts you soon will taste
Unholy feeling grows deep inside
Choking on your guts you open wide
Regurgitated guts
Satisfy his needs
Regurgitated guts
Now you're gonna bleed
Vision of the death are growing clear
Life as a corpse is what you fear
Searching through the graves to be set free
From the curse of the priest that't come to be
So unaware of what's to come
Your guts are his when he is done
Reaching for your cross to end this pain
Your life and blood he will have drained
Regurgitated guts
Satisfy his needs
Regurgitated guts
Now you're gonna bleed
In his trance
Your eyes they bleed
Your guts come forth
For his own need
