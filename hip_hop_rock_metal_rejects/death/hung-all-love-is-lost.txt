Downwards, downwards -
Lifes spiralling descent.
All love is lost.
Premature and unreasoning.
Perversley chained without any values.
Wretched, Degraded.
Take it all on the chin.
To forever hold my piece........
The reins turned noose pull taut as I fall.
The figment is more painful than the fact.
And I'm the one to hang
Just for being me!
The murky clouds wash,
Solace comforts me not,
And I'm the one to hang
Just for being me!
Black numbing blanket smothers attrition
Once and for all.
