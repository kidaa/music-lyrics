Throughout our time a thought
escapes us to enforce a word, no
holding on to pain it may seem to some
The easy way to say o.k., twist your
knife a little deeper
words to sharp actions dark
hide the blade of the deceiver.
Enforce the words no more, be free
alone you might just find serenity.
To accept another day we choose
to give away another piece of life
to forgive is to suffer
Solo Schuldiner
Once or twice is kind
three or four is blind
it is not the end yet a way to begin
the power of words both good and bad.
