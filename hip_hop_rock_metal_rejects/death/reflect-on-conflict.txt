Music: Pintado, Lyrics: Embury
Something to prove, something to say
Feeling secure, a false portrait
Forging alone the facts unknown
Hiding the to drag us on
Trapping the standpoint
Local disjoint
More to protect than to reject
Reflect the conflict inside
Punish the core, the more unsure
Testing the strenght of us once more
Peeling away the scar to bleed
Peeling again a growing seed
Accept the consequence
Unlike our differences
Shameless and painless -
Reflect on conflict
