I wake up and I look at my face-can`t remember
I can`t remember where I`ve been last night
With whom I`ve, what I`ve done can`t remember what really happened
Although I push my mind so hard
And my thoughts trail off to the frozen garden in my heart
Strange eyes penetrate me
Who am I to see the difference 
I`ve been demolished, I`ve been crushed down
I stood up angry and I built a wall
No reason there for me to flee 
I don`t believe your attitude or anyone`s
you make me a stranger to-to human contact
Never say I run away
I`m just a man who understands that
That loosing a piece of reality
Gains a piece of oneself
Behind this wall I can stand alone
In the frozen garden of my heart
I see no truth not even lies
There is only void just about everywhere
So I din`t care with whom I`ve been
And what I`ve done-the only way to stand
And the wind is cold but at least is mine
So I sleep in the Frozen Garden in my heart
