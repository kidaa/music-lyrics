I've walked to the ends of the earth,
And glanced into the eyes of those
Who were going opposite way.
They failed to bridge the gap,
First contact was a threat
And you could tsate the surging unrest.
Who wrote the law that opposites attract?
Who could be so naive?
Everyone trurts no-one.
Looking out for number one.
Ours is the primed time.
The finite thrill of the loathing -
A streak in our lifebearing dreams.
The connecting virus drives a volatile wedge.
It strenghtens to soothe the open wound,
But ours is a primed time.
Although I'm not exempt of blame,
It strenghtens to soothe the open wound,
But ours is a primed time.
Bonding? - Do you think I want the upper hand?
Broken contracts, we saw the infertile seeds
