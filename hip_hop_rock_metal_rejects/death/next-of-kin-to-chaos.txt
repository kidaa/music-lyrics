Stuck in the learning hole,
there is no teaching
that I can subscribe to -
Just the hatred of being afraid.

Trapped in a nightmare,
nothing can alter this.
Just another daydream,
calendar sadness.

Lucid, inducing swarm
becoming closer but getting colder.
The caustic grip insane.

Lucid induced

Pre-shaping destiny - hiding inside of me.
Primate illusions of
how all this should be.

Next of kin to chaos
