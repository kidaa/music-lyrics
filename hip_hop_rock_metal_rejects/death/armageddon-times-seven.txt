Lest we forget scorched earth policies,
Of megaton and Hydrogen,
And taut muscle of an armoury that flexes,
To show the world we mean business!
It's all smiles and handshakes,
But who moves to disarm?
Radium, Uranium -
One more isotop to add the collection
That's gonna eat us even more,
When there's ashes to remind us.
The age of outrage has been reasoned into submission.
And cries of peace
Are no longer in fashion.
I wonder if we'll se the point through cataracted eyes.
Or draw breath through irradiated lungs,
And sigh as we exist times seven.
