Where do we go the way when we forever say goodbye
and when I see the hell what's going on today on this earth when I die
I lie alone in my bed and see the shadows on the wall
it's the death who calls my name he tells me it's time to go

I lie alone in my bed and I'm waiting for my sleep
was it real or was it just last night a deadly dream
I lie alone in my bed and see the shadows on the wall
it's the death who calls my name he tells me it's time to go
