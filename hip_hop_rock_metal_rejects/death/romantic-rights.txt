Your romantic rights are all that you got
Push them down son it's more than just lip
C'mon girls I know you know what you want
C'mon, C'mon now and give them all shhhhh
You're beating walls now you just won't quit
You play with shapes but they just won't fit
I know you love me you don't know what you like
You're watching TV I stay up all night

I don't need you
I want you [2x]

South Carolina kid is heating things up
His wounds are bleeding and we're filling the cup
This game will save us if we don't die young
C'mon, c'mon now yea have some fun

Come here baby I love your company
We could do it and start a family
She was living alone unhappily
We could do it, it's right romantically [3x]

I don't need you
I want you [6x]
