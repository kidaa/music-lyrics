Lyrics: C.Schuldiner; Music: C.Schuldiner/J.Murphy
Transforming your live from the inside out
Overcoming fear that made your doubt
Observing what is stored in the subconscious
Trusting what you feel with your gut responses
See past in the dark and use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future fine
Avoiding pain and misery
Solo : Murphy
Look through the fake for what is real
Making decisions by what you feel
Live for the future and not the past
The weak of mind will never last
Perceiving from visions hat reoccur
Analyze your dreams to gain
A better perspective of your life
In control of your destiny with mind and soul
Solo : Shuldiner
Repeat 2nd verse
