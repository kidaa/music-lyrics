I didn't mean to make you feel out of place by the comments on your clothing or the makeup on your face i didn't mean to preempt the chase you're the drama queen of every scene perfectly out of place only cynicism can get through to you expand the image up the insults negativism through and through all of this pretending makes me feel a bit confused you've spent your life losing yourself and now you're marked as used so you cry yourself to sleep on your blanket of snow with your tiara of barbie doll heads and your arms crossed for a pillow if you can't make up your mind just how different you should be reorganize your priorities to expect more sympathy.
