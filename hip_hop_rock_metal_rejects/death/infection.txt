Infection's my job, I must be valiant
I'm a germ that was born with a natural talent
I enter your body then I put up a fight
No mistake I'll make you puke all night
I'll throw your body out of synch, your eyes'll turn pink
Your head'll swell, and your feet'll stink
My buddy's a tapeworm, make your stomach squirm
I'm a funky fresh germ that'll give you heartburn
My name is Mucus Rappincoccus this is where'll I'll stay
And if things are going steady you'll fart all day
Infection
Infection
Infection
Infection

You'll get a kidney stone, cancer of the liver
My buddy goes up your nose and it runs like a river
Your H.E.A.D. will feel like T.N.T.
You'll get strep, a yep, and missing teeth
I killed your dog, cat, your mouth, and rat
Your fly went bye-bye, now I'll make you fat
I'll infect your body just as fast as I can
And when I'm done you'll look like the Elephant Man
Infection
Infection
Infection
Infection

I may struggle, I won't quit
I'll find a new place and give you a zit
It takes hard work to make you feel like this
It's my job 'cause I'm an infectionist
