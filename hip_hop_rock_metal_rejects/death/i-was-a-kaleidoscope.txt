I put on my overcoat and walked into winter - my teeth chattered rhythms
And they were grouped in twos or threes, like a morse code message was sent from me to me. cars on slippery slopes, they're stuck...
People pushing through their mittens as i was beginning to feel it soaking through my shoes, getting colder with every step i took to your apartment, dear. 

And i was a kaleidoscope... the snow on my lenses distorting the image of what was only one of you and i didn't know which one to address as all your lips moved. 

This is when i forget breathe all the things i scripted, they sound unfounded.
And the look that you're giving me, it tells me exactly what you are thinking...
"this ain't working anymore." 

They got their mothers worked into a panic
Sledding down hills into oncoming traffic
The parents layered clothes until the children couldn't move then kept them outside til their noises were blue and I got left there, too. 

I put on my overcoat and walked into winter, my teeth chattered rhythms.
And they were grouped in twos or threes like a morse code message was sent from me to me.
