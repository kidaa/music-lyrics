Pilling the bodies
Burn them in the night
Skin grows black and whitered
Decayed smell with rise
Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To infernal death
Human coals are burning
Repulsive yet so true
Open graves are scattered
When the work is through
Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To infernal death
