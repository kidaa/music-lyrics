She walked with fire at her heels. 
The scent of smoke on the breeze.
Wherever she goes that's where I'll be.
Whatever she wants that's what I need.
Baby, it's been so long that even the roses hips are turning me on.
Baby, it's been so long.

I want you.
I want you.

The heat floats on top of our skin.
Like an ice cube in a glass of gin.
I can't even hear the words you say.
I need to leave, but I want to stay.
Baby, it's been so long that even the roses hips are turning me on.
Baby, it's been so long.

I want you.
I want you.
I get the feeling if I stay with you, you'll never let me go.
I want you.

Feel like a ship on dry land.
Or an island in the sand.
Your kiss is cool, despite the heat.
You've got my senses beat.
If I stay, I won't last long.
You've got a hold on me so strong.
I hear your song.
All I hear is your song.
It's so hot.
The bones show through her skin.
It's so hot.
That the bones show through her skin
