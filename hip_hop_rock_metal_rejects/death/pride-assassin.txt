Brought forth into an acceptance.
Expected mass production.
All cloned to obey without fail.
To question means breaking the mold.
To turn your back, that courage you lack...
Or live in pretense.
In youth, confused.
Prime for manipulation.
An open sore cursed with their social infections.
"Absorb to be seen as a failure"
"Not fit to breath the air we take in"
Pride Assassin.
True feelings call for deviation.
But could you face mass condemnation.
Pride Assassin.
Backed into a corner.
Why should you adhere to their illusions?
And their orders?
Willing to dictate yet for themselves exemption.
Evaluate your brain, form your own opinions.
To be an individual - compassionate and free.
