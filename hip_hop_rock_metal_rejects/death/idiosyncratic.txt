Not lacking insight or impetus to shout behind ideas that reforms in us
Will bring about.
As parallels we run so close yet as I try to draw to you,
Incoherence rears its ugly head,
Of integration? You do your utmost to discourage it.
Envy, resentment, jealousy.
Taken emotions - there is no need.
I try so hard to state my case yet as I try to draw to you,
Incoherence rears it ugly head,
Resort to slander - you drive me further away.
Breakdown of minuscule faith - my wasted efforts!!
It's your indifference, not mine, that puts me on a pedestal,
Then after the fact, you oppose me for a lack of support.
If your aims are to attract us condemnation,
The bitter taste I had now strengthens my resolve to rise above.
