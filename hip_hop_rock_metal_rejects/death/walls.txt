SIEGE
Walls that part humanity
Over which I cannot see
Walls as old as history
Cast a shadow over me
Break down the walls
Take down them all
Break down the
Take down the
Shake down the
Walls that divide the nations
Keep them in isolation
Segregate the populations
Beat down the opposition
Break down the walls
Take down them all
Break down the
Take down the
Shake down the
Barriers that divide
Trapping me inside
Bring apartheid to an end
Cross the border
Make a friend
Break down the walls
Take down them all
Break down the
Take down the
Shake down the walls
