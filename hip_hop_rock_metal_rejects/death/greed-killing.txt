Music: Harris; lyrics: Embury, Harris
The wrong time, the wrong place,
Our smiling face of distruct.
Buried, the seed deep in all our heads.
Prepared ourselves for the fall.
The greed killing!
Instinct to mistruct,
Instinct - the lust.
Their butchery of feelings,
geared for the greed killing.
The greed killing!
The lust denied is need x5
Existence is a steady flow,
the moulded image grows.
No core, no faith in what you are,
the pressure builds right from the start.
The lust denied the need x5
Could it be just sour grapes?
Or have we failed to fit their shape?
It's always give, and never take.
How much can we give?
How much can we take?
The lust denied the need x5
