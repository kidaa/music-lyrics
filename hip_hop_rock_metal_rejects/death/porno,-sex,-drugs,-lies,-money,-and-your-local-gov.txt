An empty night, an empty voice
I've seen the scenery for so long
I've made my bed, I've made my choice
There's nothing left for me
I'm in a tunnel
And I know there is a light
At the end
But I can't see it
CHORUS
I am floating on a cloud in the sky
And I am inside
Warm but not like lying in the sunlight
And I am inside
I'm tired
I'm tired

I loved you once, I don't know why
Everything never is quite enough
It may have been blind, but it was mine
Is there a thing as true love
Dear belladonna come
Take me  home back to sleep
Don't bring me down
The milk sugar's sweet
CHORUS
I am floating on a cloud in the sky
And I am inside
Warm but not like lying in the sunlight
And I am inside
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired
CHORUS
I am floating on a cloud in the sky
And I am inside
Warm but not like lying in the sunlight
And I am inside
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm floating on a cloud in the sky
