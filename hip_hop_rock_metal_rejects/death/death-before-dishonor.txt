[V1:]
To the haters, the takers, the liars, all the vultures and the bottom feeding scum
The FCC, the FBI and every tin god with a badge and a gun
You talk and talk, you preach and bitch but your words don't mean a thing
You get what you give, you give what you get
Just the way it's always been

[Chorus:]
I choose death before dishonor
I'd rather die than live down on my knees
Bury me like a soldier, with my dignity!

[V2:]
You imitate the ostracized, put your head beneath the sand
Your cup it runneth over, must be rough to live so grand
You reap what you sew, you pay what you owe unless you bathe yourself in greed
You rob and you take, your world is fake
There's no honor amongst the thieves

[Chorus:]
I choose death before dishonor
I'd rather die than live down on my knees
Bury me like a soldier, with my dignity!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Fuck!
You're self righteous, self pretentious
Your ways are not for me
You're deluded, so confused
Your world is not for me

[Chorus:]
I choose death before dishonor
I'd rather die than live down on my knees
Bury me like a soldier...

Bury me! Bury me!
Bury me! Bury me!
Bury me!

With my dignity!
