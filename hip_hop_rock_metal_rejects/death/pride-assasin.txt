Brought forth into an acceptance
Expected mass production
All cloned to obey without fall
To question means breaking the mould
To turn your back, that courage you lack
Or live in pretence
In youth confused
Prime for manipulation
And open sore cursed with their social infections
Absorb to be seen as a failure
Nor fit to breathe the air we take in
Pride assasin
True feelings call for deviation
But could you face mass condemnation?
Pride assasin
Backed into a corner
Why should you adhere to their illusions
And their orders
Willing to dictate yet for themselves exemption
Evaluate your brain form your own opinions
To be an induvidual - compassionate and free
