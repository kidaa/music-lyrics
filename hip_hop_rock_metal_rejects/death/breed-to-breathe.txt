Music: Embury, Lyrics: Embury
Divorced humanity
Science strays
Walk the path of servitude
Grown unknown malignant code
Misconceived the passion whole
Misconceived the passion whole
Born against the innocent
Amongst us issues preset
Determined goals which are set
Love: a crime of serverance
Are we free to feel!?
Do we hurt to heel!?
Whose life to steal!?
Whose life to steal!?
Awareness fails the public eye
Primate morals sell the lie
2,2 - symbolic bait
A process - bound genetic fate
The selfish feed - breed to breed
