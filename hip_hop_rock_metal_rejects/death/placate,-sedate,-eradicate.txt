Music: Pintado; lyrics: Greenway
Load the burden across my shoulders.
Pour the effluent on thick.
Placate, sedate, eradicate.
Wage a war on my prone feelings.
Anaesthetised and numb.
Placate, sedate, eradicate.
Strangely calm when I should be enranged.
Placate, sedate.
Placate, sedate.
Eradicate.
Don't befriend the silver screen,
As long as others face firing lines.
Recline, relax take it in your stride,
Be the voyeur. x2
Tamed by rabid entertainers.
Engrossed in real life hell.
Placate, sedate, eradicate.
Only observing - I'm exempt.
