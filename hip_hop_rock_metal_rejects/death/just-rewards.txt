Music: Harris; lyrics: Greenway
I lived for a moment
I grabbed hold and I didn't relent
Skin of my teeth,
Holds no longer.
And now I come to claim my just rewards.
Face down! Ground down with no recourse.
And now I come to claim my just rewards.
The spoils of the toils are spent.
Where is the right place?
Where is the right place, right time?
If the face fits, wear it/
Faces fit while heart and soul slopes on.
Scraping through - Just Rewards!
Dig the dirt - Just Rewards!
Hold your ground - Just Rewards!
Being sucked down  -Just Rewards!
Where is the right place?
Where is the right place, right time?
When you lay down on your own law,
You swim against the sanctimonious tides.
When you lay down on your own law,
You swim against the sanctimonious tides.
Down not out - Just Rewards!
Looping tracks - Just Rewards!
Stuned growth - Just Rewards!
Dwindling hope - Just Rewards!
I lived for a moment
I grabbed hold and I didn't relent
Skin of my teeth,
Holds no longer.
And now I come to claim my just rewards.
