B.Bowersock / M.Vernon / P.Juvet
There was a moment in time
When you said you'd be mine
Till the day
Everything faded away
We were watching love grow
Like the roses you saw
In the spring
But roses have thorns that can sting
Don't you think it's a crime
That we wasted our time
All along
Wondering where love had gone
Still alive
Still alive
I know only the love survives
Still alive
Still alive
After everything else has died
After all of the wars have been fought and lost
The battle is finally won
After paying the price, was it worth the cost
When all is said   done?
First they tell you this
Then they switch it to that
They make you rich
Then they leave you flat
They say they will
Then they tell you they won't
First they know for sure
Then they've given up hope
First they give it up
And they rub it in
They go bersek
And then they're bored again
They give it up
And then they want it all
First the straight   narrow
Then it's off the wall
When I thought I'd had all I could stand
Nothing turned out like I planned...
