I've slipped the noose,
The stackles are off.
My naturity fixation outshines.
It's go for broke
And fuck it all,
With head held higher than thou
I am the man that used to care.
Who was I then?
So quizzical with foresight.
Now I've favoured to saviour the flavour
Of nine-to-five intitution.
Out with the old,
In with the never rgime.
I sold my soul to the robotised dream.
Breaking bones of contention.
I'm just an empty shell
With integrity scooped out.
A painted smile,
A glass-eyed high on two that can't cry.
Touch me,
I'm cold to the merits of real love.
I stepped back from the edge
