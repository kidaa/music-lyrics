Next time my heart breaks in cold rage
I'll be on your page
Waves of misunderstanding crashing
Demanding passage through

Dont tell me I've changed
Dont tell me I've changed

You've got your rights
Dont mean its right, ethical or sane
I'm not your type your beholding me
Dont remind, regret

Still 'Desperate is as desperate does'
Self served purpose, grasping straws
Ugly hate and ill breed heart
Misunderstanding from the start
