Ashes and promises share a bond
Throught the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined
Claws so rasor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
Chorus :
Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real ?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words...
No escaping  from those haunting empty words...
Solo: schuldinger
Do you ever feel it ?
A craving that is so stroong
To by thought rewind in order to find
Expectations that shined thought the doubt
That soon would turn unto the price
Of what a word will be worth
When tomorrow comes
To be and we are left
Standing on our own -
And seeing what is real...
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined
Claws so rasor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
