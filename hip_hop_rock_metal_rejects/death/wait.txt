Every town has a diner 
where I'll meet you, and your friends too. 
Things are just a bit nicer over some coffee; 
you can tell me all about your day. 
I don't know much about you, 
not that i want to, 
not that i want to. 
Sometimes I can't escape from my room so excuse me, 
I'll be just a little late. 

You will wait for me, 
you will wait for me

Every town has a corner, 
where I'll see you and your friends too; 
hanging out looking cool, 
saying the same things over and over again. 
Sometimes we all feel stupid, 
we say the wrong things; 
you're not the only one. 
Sometimes we all get left behind 
in a race of style, 
it's a dumb thing. 
you will wait for me 
you will wait for me 
you will wait for me 
you will wait for me
