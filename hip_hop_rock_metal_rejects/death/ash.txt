We set out at dusk
We left them, well, not much
The boys were shoutin' and kickin' up dust
Oh and as we ran
With the fire behind us
And the torch in my hand
I knew I couldn't do it again

The ghosts were howlin' in the late afternoon
We were singin' along to the same old tune
I turned to my brothers to look 'em in the eyes
And there was ash....ash falling from the sky

The moon cast a little light but the flames lit up the night
All the animals laid down and died and there was ash.....
Oh and as we ran with the fire behind us and the torch in my hand
I knew I couldn't do it again

The ghosts were howlin' in the late afternoon
And we were singin' along to the same old tune
I turned to my brothers to look 'em in the eyes and there was ash....fallin' from the sky

And who could tell the dogs from the men?
I seen their faces and I know where they've been
I know I'm with 'em but I ain't like them! I--

And who could tell the dogs from the men?
I seen their faces and I know where they've been
I know I'm with 'em but I ain't like them! I--

It makes me so tired
I was like smoke without the fire
And I know I ain't like them, no!
