Technicolor girls are always on the phone 
talking about their homes 
and the conversations continue endlessly. 

Technicolor boys, transistor radios 
blasting their treble tones 
and the arguments are disputed after school, 
in the parking lot as the teachers bend the rules. 

Patiently you waited for a courting boy's embrace, 
then everyone would know. 
But the letter jacket wasn't yours to own 
and it proves to be on temporary loan. 

And as they all grow older the truth will be understood, 
cause we never turn out the way we thought we would.
