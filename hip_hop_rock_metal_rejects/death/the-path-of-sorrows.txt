Good lookin' girl in the corner
She nice enough to eat
She look over and she smile a little
From her head to her feet.
Over and over and over
Trying to catch her eye,
If I don't do something, it'll come to nothing
Hate myself the rest of my life.
You can't accuse me honey,
You know I feel just fine,
I know and you know that I know
Oh Yeah, I know you're mine all mine
Girl was looking me over
Just checking me out
Looked me in the eye, and I was like to die
Knew what I was all about
Tell me, tell me, please tell me,
Tell me what you're gonna say,
If you don't say yes, I'm gonna be depressed
Sure hope I'm doing ok.
You can't accuse me honey,
Talking dirty ain't no crime,
I know you know and you know that I know,
Oh Yeah, I know you're mine all mine
Said she was thinking it over,
She got a look in her eye,
Told me her name, expected the same,
And so I told her mine,
Forever and ever and ever,
I swear I can't be no liar
Gonna be your man
And you'll be glad that I am
Burn you in sexual fire
You can't refuse me honey,
We'll get along just fine.
I know you know and I know where you go,
Oh Yeah, I know you're mine all mine
