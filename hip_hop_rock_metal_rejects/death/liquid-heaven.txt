Red eyes I see 
Watching carefully my face
Smiling with fury and pain
These eyes are mine
Reminding the time
When mind and body decay
I laugh as I die shivering with ecstasy
My body lays pale 
At the corner of the room
The syringe piercing my vain 
And oh these eyes are still watching
Bloody is my nose
Thrashing is my heart
I no longer care, I fly
I scream as I die-terrors beyond belief
