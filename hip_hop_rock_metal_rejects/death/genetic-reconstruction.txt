Lyrics: C.Schuldiner; Music: C.Schuldiner/J.Murphy/T.Butler
Extending a life with total resistance
To fatal disease, future methods of science
Replacing what is real by using technology
Population control, selecting those who will breed
A specific type of form chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy
Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production
Solo : Murphy, Shuldiner
Producing a race of human machines
A new age of existence the world will see
Repeat 2nd verse
