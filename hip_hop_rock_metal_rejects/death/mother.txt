I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin' no
Cause worryin's a waste of my time

The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone

I used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
Said a little better than before

We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, No, No, He won't leave me alone

Now I get up around whenever
I used ta get up on time
But that old man
he's a real muthafucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

I used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used ta do a little
but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin'
ta get a little better
Said a little better than before

We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
He won't leave me alone
No, No, No, he won't leave me alone
He won't leave me alone

Stuck it in the middle, and I
Shout it in the middle, and I
It drove me out of my mind
Shoulda known better, said
I wish I never met her, said I
I leave it all behind
