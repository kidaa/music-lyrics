In your dreams
The pain so real
Before the dead
You'll have to kneel
Hear your future scream
See you epitaph
As you scream
The dead they laugh
Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair
Denial of life vile denial
Denial of life
Denial of life
Created by your mind
To overtake your life
Sacrifical suicide
End it with a knife
Much to late
To change your mind
A bloody corpse
Is left behind
Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair
Denial of life vile denial
Denial of life
Denial of life
