Lyrics Embury - Music Pintado
Malformed spirit
An infestation
Supressing ways of communication
Depression lingers
Then the journey
At wits end in a socialised hell
Confusion in recognition
Pessimistic thoughts invade
Shared amounts to archieve a goal
Roles reversed could summon change
Verse x 2
Expectations are enquired
Exceptions should be required
