I can't stop thinking of you

I don't want to say it

I can't stop remembering you

I don't want to think it

All the promises I made to you

I broke

But you still live so close to me

You said you wouldn't sell your ring

And it's so hard to let go

It's so hard to let go

I know our past must go

I'll give you the time you need

You threw a party just for me

Yes, it was perfect

Then you slept with an angry man

I'm sorry that I felt it

All the promises I made to you

I broke

But you still live so close to me

I hope you didn't sell your ring

And it's so hard to let go

It's so hard to let go

I know our past must go

I'll give you the time you need
