A chronic complaint of dimness
Prevails your profound ideology
A romantic version of a master race
Attained through coercive froms of authority
Your observance is negigence
If you see the threat from different cultures
We're all in this sinking ship
Each of us together
Where does the whiteman stand?
Where does the blackman stand?
Where do we all fucking stand?
Knee deep in shit
Look into yourself
And you'll find the real oppressor
To a life of unchallenged hate
It's yourself who's the nigger
