based on Stephen King`s The Dark Tower Book series
The man in black fled across the desert
And the Gunslinger followed
On the quest for his lost soul
Through fields and worlds
Through Tull and Allie he walked
Obsessed by cruelty and logic
Powerful enough to destroy
Obsessed-was not fate. Unembraced
Crawling thought, I paused I paused
Sleep on my friend and dream
For thousands of years to come
Wake up in a different time
At Golgotha of the Otherworld the Otherworld
A knight of a Different kind
Baptized with the blood of his master
Leaving the ruins of the Gilead
For the heart of all words
With burning eyes he looks at the sun trying to follow the brilliance
The brilliance that shows his destination`s point
Worlds are sick and that`s the truth
The Guardians are dead, the knowledge a wasteland
For the people of this dune people of this dune
Oh, Knight enter me from the door in the back of my mind
Draw me into your Quest to heal 
The suns in the heart of the Rose
Make your destination mine
Blain is Pain and that`s the truth
We all serve the Tower
For the Tower is the truth
Oh, my soul within me is burning
That`s why I find the soul amusing
He refused to be alone
It seems that the man beside him was the crowd to him
Draw everyone of the many who are one
With the power of all, the Tower is getting closer
Follow the path of the Beam the way of the Tower
Merge with God and heal-the riddle is mine to solve
