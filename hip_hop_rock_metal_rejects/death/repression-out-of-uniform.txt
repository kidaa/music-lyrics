Phobic - eggshell-walking on a brink.
Camera sensor eyes pierce.
We excuse stone-set normality.
yet send tremors through morality.
Frozen optics,
traction for outspoken heads.
Fuck your badgeless, rankless dirge
and bizarre take on community concern.
Division is your vision.
Cajoled - jostled into position
where we can't ascend or defend.
Funny how you're moulded by perfection;
Which visionary told you so?
Curse our influence,
traction for outspoken heads.
Your true colours make us reel - scab
Garish hue with bilious sheen - scab
no dressing up to the nines - scab
It's permanent under the skin.
Policing the detritus - unclean!
Policing the benign?
Fuck your badgeless, rankless dirge
and fuck assumptions that we're dirt
This derision builds a prison... for you!
