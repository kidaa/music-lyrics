music: Nick, Dennis, Costas lyrics: Themis Katsimihas
The Century`s twilight is so close
I stand on the Icebers` tip and looking out I recollect
The things that passed the ways we close to last among the other
I see them all-yes I see them all behind
We left them there- there in futile wars
When this was the written riddle
"Who Is The Perfect Enemy?"
The first weapon that I held was a bone from a dead beast
So many more have come and gone, so easy to left`em all behind
There were times when I was crimson bathed with their blood
But if it wasn`t for the week I wouldn`t be here now
We left them there in wars of Arrogans
When we wrote the riddle
"Who is the Perfect Enemy?"
chorus
As I first traveled the land, then I waded the water
Then I ripped the sky with the stars as my guide
But I flew high I touched the sky
I touched the stars and left my marks behind
I`ve seen life beyond imagination, lifeful beings 
And I kill them all
I stepped on them, in the wars of Acquisition
When I spoke the riddle "Who Is The Perfect Enemy?"
There`s no one else left around
No one can see how I rot in Grief
I stand alone now admiring my work but my sense has turned against me
I lived a condemned life of lies
To learn about the truth but never to live in
And I asked myself "Who Is The Perfect Enemy?"
Who else-who else but the
Who else but the Enemy Within
