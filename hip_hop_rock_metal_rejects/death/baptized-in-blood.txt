Under command a newborn child
Sembered in blood, the dead they smile
Growing possessed, burning inside
A bloody feast for us tonight
The way of death
Is growing near just take my hand
Skies grow black
Unholy corpeses upon their hand
The dead they gather around
Praising the child they found
Possessed, the child shall kill
The future is now revealed
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Baptized in blood
Reborn they'll learn
Gather around, watch and see
A new creation of misery
Talking the place of the elderly dead
Forbidden ways now in his head
The way of death
Is growing near just take my hand
Skies grow black
Unholy corpeses upon their hand
The dead they gather around
Praising the child they found
Possessed, the child shall kill
The future is now revealed
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Baptized in blood
Reborn they'll learn
