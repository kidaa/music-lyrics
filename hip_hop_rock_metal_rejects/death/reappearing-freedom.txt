I am the son and daughter
I`m the only child of father that breeds you
I watch from above seeing my blood feed the roses
giving you the cross
A step closer I fight not while you
While you pound that nail in me
I suffer the sins of the world may as a splinters 
of the wood-the lashes on the whip on my back
A thorned crown on my head fuzzes my way of thinking
Like a human
Watching the sponge of sorrows
Floating its way into my mouth
And the lance of greed piercing my side
I cannot breath
I fly as God as I am the seprent below
The rainbow above the bondage to temptation is broken
After nights and days that I promised I walk
Again on the Earth
Through the hole in my hand I watch
I watch your fear
When the lord of fire shall come He will tear sky and earth apart
Fly the way to the rainbow-only it shines after every storm
Children of Death, resurrect
Ascend to me and cry-you are free!!!
