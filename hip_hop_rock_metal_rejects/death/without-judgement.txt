Guity until proven innocent
We codemnn your soul and fate
Never mind the possibilities
Too busy for logic or to calculate
Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is accknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished
Chorus :
Without judgemenent  what would we do ?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what ma be
Without judgemenent
Perception would increase a million times
Solo: schuldinger

Distracted by the imagination
That experiments with ease
If could taste it, it might be addictive
Where life will crush those who defy
Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is accknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished

repeat chorus
