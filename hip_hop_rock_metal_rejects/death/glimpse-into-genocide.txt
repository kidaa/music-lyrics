Music: Pintado; lyrics: Embury
Blindness leading.
Which one of me is real?
Through corridors of uncertainity
A force without form.
I've dug a hole so deep,
full of the shit of compromise.
For once can't I keep
pain on the outside.
Adapt.             
Take on release.   
Others.            
Thoughts infringed.
                    x2
Adapt.             
Take on release.   
A life -           
On pause syringed. 
A glimpse into genocide.
My own emotionsm a million strong.
A heart so full of emptiness -
