Tell me, assure me
I really can't relate to your dishonesty
Dissention, seeking attention
Yet segregation from the ones that really cared
Tell me, assure me
I really can't relate to your dishonesty
Cash styled deadhead, no conscience or opinions
Material gain bar happiness means shit
It means shit
Mass appeal madness eats your brain
False influence like a leach
Sucking dry your veins
Public eyes see fit your second face
Freakshow - fooling those who imitate
Clever marketing to dominate
Screwing those who gave you your big break
And when the bubble bursts
Exposing your selfish crap
You'll cry for sympathy
We'll just sit back and laugh
