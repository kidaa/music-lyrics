You may tire of me as our December sun is setting because I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for: both a beginning and an end 
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on accident 

On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still reside. 
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn for the sea like navy men 
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed 
Like brothers on a hotel bed
