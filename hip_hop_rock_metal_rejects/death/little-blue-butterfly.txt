She said,  who answered the phone?
i dont understand, i thought youd be alone
tonight.
I said,  the girl who lives here,
said the band could stay if we bought the
beer.
she said,  i dont like the sound of that,
tell me what she looks like - thing or fat?
i said,  uh...i cant really say,
what does it matter anyway?

i said,  it's good to hear your voice,
i really do miss you but we made the right
choice.
she said,  i hope you're eating well and
living here w/o you is living through
hell.
i said,  ...well i may be home early
it'll be a few days till i know for surely
shirley! Is that her name?
is she in love and do you feel the same?
no, i dont feel the same

chorus:
i cannot find a way to make peace with
you today.
so where will we be tomorrow?

so i busted my ass to make it home and
when i got there -  she wasnt alone
she said,  you're home so soon.
i didnt get a chance to clean the room.
I said,  ...forget this house...
road cheese calls both man and mouse.
she said,  dont end it this way.
i really did miss you everyday
...well...almost everyday...in every way.
