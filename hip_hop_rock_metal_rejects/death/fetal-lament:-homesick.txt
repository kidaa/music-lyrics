A mother's nightmare - to lose her only child
A loss of life, an infant's tragic death
A family torn apart with pain and sorrow
What it the child should return...?
A mother's nightmare - to see her child drown
she cries for her child's life, my death
In her arms she holds my lifeless form
I open my eyes and cry...
A mother's nightmare - to watch her child burn
The burning smell of cooking flesh
I'm charred beyond death itself
Then I sit up and scream...
Dead babies ferment in a field of flowers
Overgrown with weeds and disease
Dead babies rot in a field of flowers
Turning black in their own blood...
Dead babies dead under a sky so black
Bleeding eternally
Dead babies dead in a field so black
But what it they should live...?
