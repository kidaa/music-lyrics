All this pain is a hate disease,
intravened into my heart.
Bittersweet emotional fall
choking dry the lifeline strong?
A time stretched farce.
Who do we fool?
Salacious thoughts
pulling at strings.
Intake decay,
the vision burns.
Intake decay,
stranger now.
Feed on the lie
that kept it strong.
Do we confess?
Admit our worth.
I drown myself in my fears insecure,
How can I trust passing time reassure?
There's no more me.
I drown myself in my fears insecure,
How can I trust passing time reassure?
Reclusive me, instigate, fence off blows.
Forced to admit - Realise how it goes.
There's no more me.
