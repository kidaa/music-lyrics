Decapitated head licking your cunt
Sucking all the blood from you stump
Intestinal guts taking their hold
Leaving you dead, stiff and cold
Controling the minds of the bloodthirsty dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell
Labotomized corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess
Scream bloody gore
Scream bloody gore
Inject the reborn terror, blood comes spurting out
Another to control add it to the count
Orders to destroy, rip and tear apart
Wishing for the end, your death is just the start
Controling the minds of the bloodthirsty dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell
Labotomized corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess
Scream bloody gore
Scream bloody gore
Armies of the dead
Hail their leader's hand
Hungry for the flesh
While it's warm and flesh
Through the smoke who will see
Who will come out alive
Now it's your turn to feel thee pain
Now it's your turn to die
