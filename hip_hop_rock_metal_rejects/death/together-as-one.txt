Labelled a creation of evil
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance
Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds,two hearts,one soul
Separating mentally
And illusion of privacy
Together - they absorb each others lives
As one - they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun
Solo: Schuldiner
Displayed as a nightmare
Criticized through words and eyes
As they stare
To the normal it seems grotesque
Connected by a bond of flesh
