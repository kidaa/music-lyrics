Wherever we go,whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps
And our breath
Protecting and watching all...
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you ?
Folowing all instincnts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure
Chorus:
Sacred is the gift that they
Have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of time
Solo: schuldinger

Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack
Time that is short - distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you ?
Folowing all instincnts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure
repeat chorus
