So we're still in our teething stages
As far as politics are concerned
That's fine coming from someone
To whom sensationalism be their only wisdom in words
A self-proclaimed spokesman
On something to which prior knowledge excedes
Championing no more censorship
Then ridiculing our beliefs
To appeal to our better nature
Are we to keep our mouths shut?
Easy to discard
Constructive power
At your disposal
When egos and sales
Outbalance opinions
On the scales
Using bands
As pawns in your hands
Building up
Knocking down
Sensationalise
To suit cheap public demand
Merging with the gutter press
You claim to detest
It's opened it's lid
For you to crawl in and infest
