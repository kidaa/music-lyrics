Yes me, I'm the man with too much time on my hands
I sell tapes even though there's almost no demand
I write rhymes even though none of my rhymes sell
I take showers even though it won't help the smell
Do it in my basement, cheap equipment
Ate all the Doritos, need another shipment
Found another sample, wrote a new song
Recorded it 32 times and it still came out wrong
It was way too long and the vocals too low
And I think the tape deck is running a little slow
This song is even hurting my ears
We haven't been creative in ten long years

Time was made to be wastes
Belches were made to be tasted
Noses were made to run
Sudden Death was made to have fun
So we do it like this even when the people diss, I use
The Death Flower and ask 'em if they piss in the shower
I act polite and preceed with caution
Then I bust a rhyme and I try to brainwash 'em
Sales of the tapes are painfully slow
Now I'm back where it started ten years ago
To relive the death we put in our rhyme
And to see how little we've improved over time
So let's take a trip back into the past
When we started a group we didn't think would last
If you paid any money that was your mistake
Now welcome to the tenth anniversary tape
