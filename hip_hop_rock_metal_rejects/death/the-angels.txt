I live by the river on the wrong side of town
Nothing much to do here but listen to the sound
Of a train I'll never catch passin' me by
Of the muddy water drinkin' the tears that I cry
So I head you're comin' back with somebody else
Well, if I had the time, if I had a little help&
Every bridge in Dickson County would be burning down tonight
Every bridge in Dickson County would be burning down tonight
I have to think of something, I just have to find a way
Before you cross that river, before I see your face
'Cause I can see your headlights and I can feel the pain
And nothing's gonna save me if I see you again
But if I could use this torch I carry to put it all to rights
I'd be baptized in the ashes come the morning light
And every bridge in Dickson County would be burning down tonight
I'd pay the price, I'd take the blame
If I could see it all go up in flames
And if I could use this torch I carry to put it all to rights
But if I could use this torch I carry to put it all to rights
Dickson County
