Humoured,
presumed hysterical for showing alarm.
Wise man? Fuck you!
In the hands of wasters,
a means to an end.
Cast over us appraising eye,
blind ours with nonsensical science.
Don't need silver tongue or your feeble gestures.
Spin the coin, roll the dice,
the law of averages is irrelevant 'cause
the outcome's always the same.
Too many distortions in truth.
Too few solutions come to light.
Stand back, watch the bullshit fly!
Always the same!
Win the hearts of the nation with great expectations
while focusing efforts on discrediting others.
Always the same!
The naivety of trust could be a means to an end.
