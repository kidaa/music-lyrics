Lyrics Greenway - Music Harris, Mick
You come to us and criticise
Without prior inspection
Judge us as a waste of time
An incorrect perception
Just a noise - your shallow view
An opinion I find misconstrued
There's probably more thought in what we do
Than a large part of what appeals to you
Why should we? - Why the need to justify?
Only in others' presence are you motivated to jeer and jibe
Everybody has the right to opinionise
But to us your pettiness is used to occupy your tiny minds
Extremity retained- never fall into your line
