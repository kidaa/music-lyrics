There is steam rising from the gravel on the road
There is black coal filling up our homes
It seeps through the window cracks
It slips through the floorboards
The mortar is turning black
The foundation starts to crack
Honey, pack your bags and go

There is steam rising from the belly of the beast
There is hell on earth there are demons beneath the sheets
They see through the window cracks
They slip through the floorboards
The mortar is turning black
The foundation starts to crack
Honey, pack your bags and go

There is steam rising from the gravel on the road
There is black coal filling up our homes
It seeps through the cracks in the windowpane
It slips through the floorboards and up through the drain

There is steam rising from the gravel on the road
There is black coal filling up our homes
It seeps through the cracks in the windowpane
It slips through the floorboards and up through the drain
