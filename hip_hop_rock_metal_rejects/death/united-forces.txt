It doesn't matters how you wear your hair
It's what inside your head
United Forces stand for all strong and fair
Black, white and yellow and red

CHORUS-
UNITED forces UNITED forces UNITED
UNITED forces UNITED forces UNITED

Skinheads and bangers and punks stand as one
Crossover to a final scene
United Forces and their job won't be done
Until the world can see

CHORUS
No rednecks, no jocks, no macho bullshit attitudes
United Forces can't be stopped-REPEAT TWO TIMES
