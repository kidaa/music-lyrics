A condemning fear strikes done
Things they cannot understand
As excuse to cover up weaknesses that lie within
Lies
Laying you guilt and pain
On people that had no part in the molding of a life
That creates its destruction
Lies
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your part in the demise of a life
Lack of Comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentment
Solo: Schuldiner
Reaching into the minds of those that created
The depression in which they
In which they drowned their flesh and blood
Lies
So easy to blame the
Everlasting fear on a pathetic attempt
To justify the ending of life
Lies
