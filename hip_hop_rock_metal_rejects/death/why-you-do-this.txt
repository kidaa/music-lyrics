R. Cavestany, M. Osegueda
I will never understand the way you are
Your mind's an evil tod striving for more
Can't you see I can penetrate your lies
I created you but yet you still defy
It doesn't matter how hard I try
A lesson in respect is what you need
You thrive off the weak minded ones
These pour helpless souls that you deceive
Still come back to the security
Under my sleeve
Chorus
Don't beat around the bush
I know it's a task
I only have one question
Which I must ask
When I was sad and down
You suddenly came around
Like a guiding light
No need for me to fight
I told you everything
Brought me up again
Oh how that all changed
Only you to blame
Manipulative days are through
So bye bye to you
You've opposed me since the birth
Wanting your own little world
Brainwashing them to believe
You're the ruler evil supreme
Mother earth is not your toy
Your evil world I will destroy
You were deprived of your youth
You were deprived of joy
Lonely depressed little boy
Chorus
