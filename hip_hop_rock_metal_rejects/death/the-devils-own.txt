The Devil's own
Why!?

[Chorus:]
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done, will you remember...

[V1:]
Slap on the wrist, smack in the face
The family tree, gave me a name and nothing more
Neglected seed, why!?

[Pre-chorus:]
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside
I never asked to be here
It's because of you I'm godforsaken
I never wanted this
It's because of you I'm dead inside

[Chorus:]
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
What did I do wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done, will you remember me?

[V2:]
A happy home, a fairy tale, a broken dream
Gave me a life, then turned away
Killed everything, why!?

[Pre-chorus:]
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside
I never asked to be here
It's because of you I'm godforsaken
I never wanted this
It's because of you I'm dead inside

Fuck!
Father, bastard, I'm the Devil's very own
Mother, know not, just who I've become
Father, hate me, for being all your not
Mother's baby, I hate what I've become
I hate what I've become
I hate what I've become

[Pre-chorus:]
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside

[Chorus:]
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
What did I do wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done, will you remember me?
