And intergral sense
Comes with belonging to a scene
Supposedly absent of barriers
When sexism is one of many
Earnest words
Calling for unity of the sexes
When she's still the chick, or stupid bitch
Ridiculed for showing an interest
Hidden indifference
Strikes an emotion reaction
When you see an animal being abused
Yet un-noticed when a woman
Is abused in the same way
The links of oppression
Stem from the same segradation
But one our eyes are closed
Actively abusing the rights of one
Whilst fighting for those of another
The 'scene' may hold a different name
But the roleplays just the same
Equal rights are fine
As long as she's in her place
Outrightly denouncing fascism
Whilst oblivious to it taking place
Is condemnation of standards
All an act of save face
Unity a stark ambition
When our abuse surpasses recognition
