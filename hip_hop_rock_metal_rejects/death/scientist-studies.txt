What ghosts exist behind thses attic walls?
There's got to be a simpler explanation,
'cause i scrimped and i saved just to find that they've been splicing my inventions.
Cold skin and bones and this latitude... we ain't payin' until the heat comes through.
So you slept in a stocking cap and wool scarf.
Promises of payment were upon your shoulders constantly,
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense.
A four-year offense to the devoted type.
I may have got an invitation but i wasn't invited.
But i thought that this meant something more than broken hearts and new addictions.
We'll leave our sins within the carpet twine.
Our bodies will dissolve the chemicals in due time.
