Lyrics: C.Schuldiner; Music: C.Schuldiner/T.Butler
One mind divided into three, for every problem a personality
Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance, with confusion there's ignorance
Deny who they are, a fantasy gone too far
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute
Defensive personalities
Solo : Shuldiner, Murphy
Passes down from generations, years of pain and complications
Darkness was a punishment, memories time cannot mend
Brutalized from the day of birth, to reality they can't return
Existing in world of three lives inside of one
Repeat 2nd verse
