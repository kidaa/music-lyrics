Oh you should see her now
We still love her now
She is going steady
But we're not ready
To see her fall in love

I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
I have never seen you suffer
I will never hurt you mother
[Repeat]

I will never make you suffer
I will never hurt you mother
