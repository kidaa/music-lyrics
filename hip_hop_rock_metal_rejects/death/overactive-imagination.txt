Your existence is a script,
life for you is a perfomance,
play out the leading role.
Directing and premeditating every move
That creates the act of manipulation
Mastering the art of deception.
That increases your sick addiction
It's an overactive imagination
that enslaves your empty shell
Lead: Chuck
Existing in dimensions of addictive obsession
Lead: Andy
Your script will run short of ideas
The story will soon end itself
People to trust come short in number.
Like a plague your lies spread
fast across the world
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addition
It's an overactive imagination
that enslaves your empty shell
