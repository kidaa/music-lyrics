We set out for the sea with icicles in our beards
Where the wind bit like dog's teeth 
And the sea swept our ship like the hand of a god who had been enraged
So we carried our dead to the shore
And that left nine more
There was violence in the air tonight 
When the ship split in half
We lost two to the brine a and the seawater swilled across the floor
And the captain lives no more
For he sleeps on the ocean floor
The old bastard was as big as a bear
And his coffin was made of a redwood's trunk
His appetite never thinned
His belly was as wide as two barrels of gin
Cut the engine
Tie it off to the post
Heave away at my call listen well
One and all
We'll be rid of this scourge
When his body goes overboard
He'd been in irons for seventy days
Fed just gunpowder to fuel his rage
Screamed bloody murder and tore at his chains
We made him this way 
We were left on that isle with a skeleton crew
Made of dead men and sinners
Hell bound through and through
Then it was he who came to our shore and he left no more
