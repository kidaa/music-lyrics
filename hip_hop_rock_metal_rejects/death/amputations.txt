And if it was just how you wanted
You'd be glued to his bones and his brainstem
And changing your image and attitudes
Won't bring you back into your bedroom
Amputating as he's waiting 
He's unresponsive 'cause you're irresponsible
Little swinger your bottle is thinking too much
'cause you're aiming to please way off target
And i'll tell you what you must already know
Of amputating that too slow
