Want some whiskey in your water? 
Sugar in your tea? 
What's all these crazy questions they're asking me? 
This is the craziest party that could ever be, 
Don't turn on the lights 'cause I don't wanna see, 

Mama told me not to come 
Mama told me not to come 
She said "that ain't the way to have fun, son" 

Open up the window, let some air to this room, 
I think I'm almost choking from the smell of stale perfume, 
And the cigarette you're smoking, 
'Bout to scare me half to death, 
Open up the window, let me catch my breath, 

Mama told me not to come 
Mama told me not to come 
She said "that ain't the way to have fun, son 
That ain't the way to have fun, son, son, son" 

The radio is blasting, 
Someone's knocking at the door, 
I'm looking at my girlfriend, she passed out on the floor 
I've seen so many things, I ain't never seen before 
Don't know what it is, but I don't wanna see it no more 

Mama told me not to come 
Mama told me not to come 
She said "that ain't the way to have fun, no, no, no, 
That ain't the way to have fun, son" 
And mama told me, mama told me, 
Mama told me, mama told me, 
Mama told me not to come, 
That ain't the way to have fun, son, 
That aint the way to have fun, 
That aint the way to have fun, no 
That aint the way to have fun, 
And mama told me, mama told me, 
Mama told me, mama told me, 
She told me not to come, 
That aint the way to have fun, 
That aint the way to have fun, son, 
That aint the way to have fun, oh no, no, no 

Maybe I should've listened
