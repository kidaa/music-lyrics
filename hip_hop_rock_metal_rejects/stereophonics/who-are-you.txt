Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 

I woke up in a Soho doorway 
A policeman knew my name 
He said "You can go sleep at home tonight 
If you can get up and walk away" 

I staggered back to the underground 
And the breeze blew back my hair 
I remember throwing punches around 
And preaching from my chair 

Well, who are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
I really wanna know Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Tell me, who are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
'Cause I really wanna know Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 

I took the tube back out of town 
Back to the Rollin' Pin 
I felt a little like a dying clown 
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin 

I stretched back and I hiccupped 
And looked back on my busy day 
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan 
God, there's got to be another way 

Well, who are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Oh, who are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Come on and tell me, who are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Oh, who the fuck are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 

Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? 
Who, who, who, who? 
I really wanna know Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Oh, who the fuck are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Who are you? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? 
Ah, tell me who are you? Who are you? Who? 
I really wanna know, I really wanna know, 
Come on and tell me who are you? you, you and you
