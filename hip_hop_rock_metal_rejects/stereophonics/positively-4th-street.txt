You gotta lotta nerve to say you are my friend 
When I was down you just stood there grinnin' 
You gotta lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend 
You just wanna be on the side that's winnin' 
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that 
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it 
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at 
You have no faith to lose, and you know it 
I know the reason that you talk behind my back 
I used to be among the crowd you're in with 
Do you take me for such a fool 
To think I would make contact 
The one who tries to hide what he don't know 
To begin with 
You see me on the street, you always act surprised 
You see how I could look, but you don't mean it 
When you know as well as me 
You'd rather see me paralized 
Why don't you just come at once out screaming 
No, I do not feel that good 
I see the heartbreaks you embrace 
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them 
And though you're dissatisfied with your position 
And your place 
Don't you understand, it's not my problem 
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes 
And just for that one moment I could be you 
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes 
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
