Got a phone call today from Mr. Nice, 
He's often called, once or twice, 
He's on stage in town, asked me to come down, 
I was five minutes late, I had to pop by the gate, 

I stood at the side, and I listened and I tried, 
To imagine the life, that gave him that smile, 
"An audience with" it reads on the bill, 
A man that made his millions, smuggling for thrills 

Master of disguise and masters degrees, 
Who's goal in life, to set what grows free, 
I have a drink and a smoke, and some think its a joke 
and summon some pain, they can't take up the strain 

And I like stories told, and will 'till I'm old, 
All the one's growing up, are gonna love what we've known, 
Is it going to fast? am I living in the past? 
Do we think anymore? or live behind our closed doors? 

There's something about a man on a stage, 
To make you listen and think 'I wanna come back again' 
So Mr. Nice stared, it is, 
I'm glad you called, I had me a ball.
