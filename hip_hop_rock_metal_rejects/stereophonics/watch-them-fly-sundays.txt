I'd just like to say
I remember the day
I first woke with you

Some days I have to admit
The way we happened to meet
Was strange 'cos it was new

Not drinking no more
Not drinking no less
Not sleeping at all
Never in the same bed
Undressed at the bar
Engraved bench in the park
We'd watch them fly Sundays

Fly birds round my head again
Laughed at the words you said
I pushed the boat back to you
I flew from the rain again
Killed you with what I said
You already knew

Not thinking no more
Not drinking no less
Not sleeping at all
Never in the same bed
Undressed at the bar
Engraved bench in the park
We'd watch them fly Sundays

They say if something
Should fly away
And it fly's back to you again
Then it is yours
