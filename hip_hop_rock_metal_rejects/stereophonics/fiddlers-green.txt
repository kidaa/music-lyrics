September seventeen 
For a girl I know it's Mother's Day 
Her son has gone alee 
And that's where he will stay 
Wind on the weathervane 
Tearing blue eyes sailor-mean 
As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain 
For a boy in Fiddler's Green 
His tiny knotted heart 
Well, I guess it never worked too good 
The timber tore apart 
And the water gorged the wood 
You can hear her whispered prayer 
For men at masts that always lean 
That same wind that moves her hair 
Moves a boy through Fiddler's Green 
Ohhhh nothing changed anyway 
Ahh nothing's changed anyway 
Ahh anytime the day 
He doesn't know a soul 
And there's nowhere that he's really been 
But he won't travel long alone 
No, not in Fiddler's Green 
Balloons all filled with rain 
As children's eyes turn sleepy-mean 
And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain 
For a boy in Fiddler's Green
