travelling through 
a tunnel under sea 
you never know if it cracks in half 
you're never ever gonaa see me 
but you can have it all if you like 
you can have it all if you like and 
you can pay for it the rest of your 
life...life 
i wouldn't believe your wireless radio 
if i had myself a flying giraffe 
you'd have one in a box with a window 
but you can have it all if you like 
you can have it all if you like 
and you can pay for it the rest of your 
life...life 
life in the summer's on it's back 
you'd have to agree that that's the crack 
so take what you want i'm not comin' 
back
