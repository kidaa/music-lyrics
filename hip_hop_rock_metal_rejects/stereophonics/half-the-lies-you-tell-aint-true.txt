you could lick or chew tongue in style 
tonight champagne drag queen suit pinstripe 
outta line it's time to try how blisters 
on your feet blisters up your spine 
if i could choose from two 
i'd mime to be a smile 
but when you rely on a lie that's true 
and no one believes in the things you do 
'cause half of the lies you tell ain't 
true i'm gonna find out i'm gonna find a 
piece of you 
you could pick and lose diesel dreams for 
crime i should win and choose colours 
undersize a naked fake that's a face that 
fits 
for two sex brings out the spies hanging 
from your feet hollywood star style but 
when you rely on a lie that's true 
no one believes in the things you do 
'cause half of the lies you tell 
ain't true 
i'm gonna find out, i'm gonna find a piece 
of you
