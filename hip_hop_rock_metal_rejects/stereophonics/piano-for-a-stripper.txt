Light the candle today, 
I play piano okay, 
I'll play piano for you, 
Because I like what you do, do 

Take it or leave it, 
Take what you want, 
Take it or leave it, 
And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, 
And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, again, 

I'll play especially for you, 
Because I like you in blue, 
Some people like what you do, 
Others look badly on you, 

Take it or leave it, 
Take what you want, 
Take it or leave it, 
And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, 
And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, again, 

And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, 
And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, 
So now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, 
And now they tell me its over now, 
And it's only time for dreaming, again
