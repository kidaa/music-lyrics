Ever seen a blind man cross the road, 
Try'na make the other side, 
Ever seen a young girl growing old, 
Try'na to make herself a bride, 
So what becomes of you my love, 
When they have finally stripped you of, 
The handbags and the gladrags, 
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy you, 

Once I was a young man, 
All I thought I had to do was smile, 
You are still a young girl, 
And you bought everything in style, 
So once you think you're in, you're out, 
'Cause you don't mean a single thing without, 
The handbags and the gladrags, 
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy you, 

Sing a song of six-pence for your sake, 
And take a bottle full of rye, 
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake, 
And bake them all in a pie, 
They told me you missed school today, 
So what I suggest you just throw them all away, 
The handbags and the gladrags, 
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy you, 

They told me you missed school today, 
So I suggest you just throw them all away, 
The handbags and the gladrags, 
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy you
