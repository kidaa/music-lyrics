You're not in business to be popular 
It's become so much about personality 
I regard the theatre as the greatest of all arts form 
The most immediate way in which a human being 
Can share with another the sense of what appears to be unity 
First of all I choose the great roles 
And if none of these come 
I choose the ones that pay the rent 
It was like unfinished business in my life 
Wherever I went people would say 
You would have made a great James Bond. Yes. 

Lets face it postmen do not great movie heroes make 
The imagination, the industry 
And encourages the free eyes at the door 
Do not try to push your way 
Through the front gates of the profession 
But do your upmost to find an entry 
Through the world of theatre 
There' s the same surge of adrenalin 
You get just before the camera roles. 

We have lost our sense of ritual and ceremony 
But we blame the artists for not finding them for us 
Actors often behave like children 
And so they're taken for children 
Such is an actors life. 

Lets face it postmen do not great movie heroes make 
They tramp discontently through the neighbourhood 
And the only matter of contact with fellow human beings 
Tends to be 
Tends to be reading names and adresses off an envelope 
There is a great job 
There is the same surge of adrenalin 
You get just before the camera roles 
Okay if I wasn't an actor I'd be a secret agent.
