Maybe one thing, 
Maybe something, 
Maybe nothing, 
All I know is friend, 
Its nothing new, 

Maybe its me, 
What is to be, 
Maybe lucky, 
All, I ask is where, 
We're supposed to be 

I give a lot, 
I take a lot, 
Its nothing new to me, 

Maybe you've grown, 
Am I so wrong?, 
How longs to long?, 
All I want is stuff, 
To be happy, 

Maybe moving, 
Always proving, 
Am I losing all, 
That's meant to be? 
That's meant to be? 

You hear a lot, 
You're told a lot, 
Its nothing new to me, 

Maybe laughing, 
Something lacking, 
Always sometimes, 
All I hear, is how its meant to be, 

Maybe learning, 
Always searching, 
Am I asking things, 
I'll know to soon?, 
I'll know to soon?, 

You talk a lot, 
Don't do a lot, 
Its nothing new to me, 

I give a lot, 
You take a lot, 
Nothing new to me, 

Ha, Its nothing new to me 
Ha, Its nothing new to me 
Haaaaaa 
Haaaaaa
