There's just time for another, 
Could down me another one, 
When I'm leaving with the others, 
Going home sweet home, 
Surprise someone, 

Put my key into the front door, 
Keeping quiet but I'm drunk, 
When I'm creeping up the old stairs, 
Stepping over the one, the one that's done, 

Now my head is starting spinning, 
Spinning round and round, 
Could be you with a man in our bed, 
Or it could be the wine, 
Surprise 

There's still time for another, 
Could down me another one, 
But while I'm leaving with the others, 
No home sweet home, 
Surprise no one, 

Throw my keys into the river, 
Singing louder than a drunk 
And while we're sleeping on the old stairs, 
Staying up 'till its sun, down another one 

Now my head is starting spinning, 
Spinning round and round, 
Could be you with a man in our bed, 
Or it could be the wine, 
Surprise 

There's still time for another, 
Could down me another one, 
When I'm leaving with the others, 
Going home sweet home, 
Surprise no one.
