Old sailor walks my way 
Sipped his pint and told me about his day 
Hey Hey 
Said 'son times have changed 
Nothing ever seems to stay the same' 
Hey Hey 
You got your wide screen sets, dead cert bets, 
Wine and women, song and dance, alway practice safe sex 
Think they call it fast food 
High percent booze 
Porta bubble phones got your hair like Keith Moon 

In my day no one searched through my turn ups 
In my day no one stole from the neighbours 
In my day catch a film you got some pay left 
In my day 
Hey Hey 

Old sailor walked away left me to think 
How much the days have changed 
Hey Hey 
And I realised after a while he robbed me blind and slipped away 
Hey Hey 
He nicked my twelve quid watch 
My left foot sock 
Flicked ash in the pockets of my sta prest slacks 
Said 'The days haven't changed, exactly the same 
Take away the change same days same ways' 

In my day no one searched through my turn ups 
In my day no one stole from the neighbours 
In my day catch a film you got some pay left 
In my day 
Hey Hey 
Hey Hey
