We don't wanna be your enemy, 
But when we're on the field, 
It's red, white and green, 

Get beat by the Irish, 
Get beat by the Scots, 
The French ought'ta struggle, 
But you're the one we want, 
We want... 

As long as we beat the English, 
As long as we beat the English, 
As long as we beat the English, we don't care 

As long as we beat the English, 
As long as we beat the English, 
As long as we beat the English, we don't care 
We don't care
