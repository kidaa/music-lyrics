it's another way to get through the day 
picking up ripped cigarette boxes 
hoping that one remains 
yellow lucky day suck deep and bathe 
for the next ten minutes spent coughing 
all the pleasures craved 
write down all the things that 
you'd like to say 
write down all the things that 
you'd like to change 
write down all the places you'd 
like to stay 
write down anything that you want 
is yesterday, tomorrow, today 
is nothin' gonna change the way 
cracked rock top wall let the ash to fall 
left alone to wait i've never looked at 
things i've liked only things i hate 
you're not the first today not the softest 
face 
was there any that you liked 
was there any thay you didn't fake 
write down all the things that 
you'd like to be 
write down all the things that 
you don't believe 
write down all the places you'd 
like to see 
write down anything that you want 
is yesterday, tomorrow, today 
is nothing gonna change the way 
because everything that's you 
and the things that you like to do 
and all of the things that are 
come back again 
is yesterday, tomorrow, today
