He was walking round to you, 
One said French afternoon, 
So he called in to a shop for two, 
He bought himself an ice drink, 
A totally tropical nice drink, 
Then he saw what he thought was you in a room 

He thought about going over, 
But you were always much older, 
And your sex dressed breasts, impressed too, 
He'd really like to get it together, 
Before the twelth of never, 
So he's coming over 

It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear, 
The sex and love it's enough for the time outta touch out of luck 

He always liked them older, 
So that his top lip touched on her shoulder, 
Lionized undisguised kill for you, 
Like to show you his t-shirt sun tan, 
Love to show you his minute head stand, 
Then a gun spun open 

It's when all the phases come around, the clothes you wear, 
The sex and love it's enough for the time outta touch out of luck 
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear, 
The sex and love it's enough for the time outta touch out of luck 

From you to me, to me to you 
From you to me, to me to you 
From you to me, to me to you 
From you to me, to me to you 

It's when all the phases come around, the clothes you wear, 
The sex and love it's enough for the time outta touch out of luck 
It's when all the phases come around the clothes you wear, 
The sex and love it's enough for the time outta touch out of luck 
Out of luck, hey hey heya
