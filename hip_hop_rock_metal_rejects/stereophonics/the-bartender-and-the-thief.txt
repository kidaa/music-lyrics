when you think about it he's watching 
every word you say hey dazed and when 
he's sussed you out he calls her up and out 
she comes and hustles us 
the bartender and the thief are lovers 
steal what they need like sisters and 
brothers 
met in a church a night to remember 
robbing the graves of bodies 
dismembered 
he watched the lesbian talk she kissed and 
groped but mostly talked in lust crushed 
he couldn't make the call his eyes were 
gripped on licking tongues enough's enough 
failed for once 
long digging gone fishing love 
drinking 
the bartender and the thief are lovers 
steal what they need like sisters and 
brothers 
met in a church a night to remember 
robbing the graves of bodies 
dismembered 
saved what they stole to meet at the alter 
place where they first set eyes on each 
other 
flew to the sun to start life all over 
set up a bar and robbed all the locals
