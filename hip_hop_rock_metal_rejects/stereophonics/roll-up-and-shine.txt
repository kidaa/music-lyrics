why don't you take a look in my mouth 
why don't you take a look at yourself 
so why don't you take a look around 
so why don't we take a look inside 
roll out the shock parade 
free falling from a stage 
performance and cocktails 
roll up and shine 
I hang the devil from a circus wire 
face up seats four in love spittin fire 
so why don't you take a look around 
so why don't we take a look inside 
it's time to live it's time to love 
it's time to do what's afraid of 
it's time to breathe time to relieve 
it's time to shine 
so why don't you take a look around 
so why don't we take a look inside 
roll out the shock parade 
free falling from a stage 
performance and cocktails 
roll up and shine 
bring on your shock parade 
freaks falling from the stage 
performance and cocktails 
roll up and shine
