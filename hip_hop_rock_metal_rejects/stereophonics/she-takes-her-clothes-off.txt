she's got another fantasy 
she lives in flat number twenty three 
picked first prize for carnival queen 
and now she takes her clothes off 
collects the covers off her magazines 
she longs to be another teenage dream 
the problem is she's turning forty three 
she still takes her clothes off 
she got the nick name porta bubble joan 
they found her dead dead as nails at home 
and she said i'm gonna be another marilyn 
bleach my hair and get real thin 
and everybody's gonna wanna dance with me 
she loved to have her little fantasies 
she longed to be the wife of jimmy dean 
but jimmys head sits in jimmys knees 
she loves to take her clothes off 
police are looking around at twenty three 
they found her hanging from her swollen 
feet they saw her dance last in woolworth 
street 
she loved to take her clothes off 
she got the nick name porta bubble joan 
they found her dead dead as nails at home 
and she said i'm gonna be another marilyn 
bleach my hair and get real thin 
and everybody's gonna wanna dance with me 
everybody wants to be the carnival queen 
everybody wants to be the carnival 
king or queen 
we all read the books 
she takes her clothes off one by one 
off again
