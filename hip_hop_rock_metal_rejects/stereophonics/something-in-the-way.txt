Underneath the bridge 
The tarp has sprung a leak 
And the animals are trapped 
And have all become my pets 
And I'm living off of grass 
And the drippings from the ceiling 
But it's ok to eat fish 
Cause they haven't any feelings 

Something in the way ah ahhh 
Something in the way yeah ah ahh 
Something in the way ah ahh 
Something in the way yeah ah ahh 
Something in the way mmm 
Something in the way yeah ah ahhh
