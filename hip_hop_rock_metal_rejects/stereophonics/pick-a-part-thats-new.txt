i've never been here before 
didn't know where to go 
never met you before 
i've never been to your home 
that smells not unknown 
foot steps made of stone 
walking feels familiar 
you can do all the things that 
you like to do 
all around underground pick a part 
that's new 
you can do all the things that 
you like to do 
all around upside down pick a part 
that's new 
people drinking on their own 
push buttons on the phone 
was i here once before 
is that my voice on the phone 
that last drink on my own 
did i ever leave at all 
confusions familiar 
so what's new to you
