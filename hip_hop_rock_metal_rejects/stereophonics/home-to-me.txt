That's my home to me 
That's my home to me 
Please don't take it from me 
Please don't take it from me 
From Me 
Electric lights blow my stare 
I'm crawling for a space to breath 
Why should my home concern your needs 
Please don't take it from me 
A baby chair 
A rocking horse 
A nervous wreck 
A memory loss 
And sleeping pills 
Ease the pain 
I'm coming back 
I'm back again again 
That's my home 
That's my life to me 
Please don't take it away from me 
Please don't take it away from me
