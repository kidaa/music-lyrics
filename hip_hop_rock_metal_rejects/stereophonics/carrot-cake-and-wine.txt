I'm looking good Got my shoulders back 
A few more drinks I'm up to dance 
I get the eye as I lift my glass 
The first time in six months 
She looks again I start to shake 
My shoulders twitching 
I'm on my way 
I glance behind me for safety sake 
to see a clock the size of a plane 
The night is young more fish in the sea 
Who's to say she wasn't looking at me 
I sink my head back in to my glass 
Get in to shape for that first dance 
I turn away I look to the south 
I pull my foot from out of my mouth 
To my surprise she's standing beside me 
Asking if I'd like to dance 
I'm standing in a hall of smoke 
Her tongues in my mouth 
I'd love to choke 
Her knight approaches us on foot 
Left his side kick at the brook 
He offered me a cigarette 
I said I'm far to young to smoke 
So he tried to entertain me 
Told me one more crappy joke 
In my ear except the joke wasn't clear 
Set the joking aside 
Should I run should I hide 
I've decided to stay rub it in his face 
What I thought was the case 
Was an easy mistake 
I just like to try some carrot cake and wine 
Can't I try taste my carrot cake and wine 
Looking good not looking back 
Knight of hers took her off to dance 
I get the eye but not for the last time 
She looks again I start to shake 
My legs are twitching my eyes are fake 
I glance behind me for safety's sake 
To see my girlfriend's tongue in the 
Face of a friend who is far from a man 
Should I hide should I run 
Must have see what I've done 
Decided to stay liked the look on her face 
What I thought was the case 
Was an easy mistake 
I'd just like to try some carrot cake and wine 
Can't I try taste my carrot cake 
Why cant I try Why should I lie 
Taste my try some of my 
Carrot cake and wine
