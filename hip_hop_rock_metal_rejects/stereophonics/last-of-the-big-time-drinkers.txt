Ten minutes flat after that day at the factory
I'm Drinking like a dog in the sun
I don't need to eat or sleep or work, at the weekend
Drop my guts
And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink

I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers
The beer don't taste the same without my name painted on the glass

I don't live to work, I work to live, I live at the weekend
I nearly spent a week in the sun
Come home with my bird, sheets thrown out the window
And sunday morning comes
And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink

I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers
The beer don't taste the same without my name painted on the glass

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink

I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
Last of the big time drinkers
Just give me half a pint of slops
Last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my job
Last of the big time drinkers
