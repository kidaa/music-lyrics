I arrive in a taxi, a Mercedes Benz, 
I was driving along, alone, with no friends, 
Jumped into the Maritim Belle Vue In Kiel, 
You woke and you said, she said "how do you feel?", 
I feel fine, so I'm signing my name, 

She said "you're in here tonight, you're the only one staying", 

Look left down the hall, at the state of it all, 
The leather was brown, there was only the sound of a..., 
Turn off the floor, until you're your mirrored wall, 
Lampshades of gold, lined up on the floor, in a row 

Lined up in a row, 
Oh no, lined up on the floor, 

I was hungry again, out to eat with no friend, 
In a restaurant, what's open, at least that's what I'm hoping, 
I ordered the fish, they say "went into Rome", 
The waiter smiled, but he wanted to go on home, 
So go, go on home, 

Just go, 
Go, go on home, 

The meal was good, but I'm drinking alone, 
I could murder a nightcap, I decided to go, 
The bar was empty, you asked "what you having?", 
I think its a Vodka, and it looks like I'm buying again, 
It seems you've got your own friends 

Yes again, 
I think I'm buying again, 

I felt like your tourist, sinking alone, 
The barman looked weird, so I drank me some more, 
I scanned round the room to see two old friends, 
Who were Laurel and Hardy fans and late at the end, 

Oh no, I should go on home, 
Oh no, sliding down on the floor, 

I got up to leave, so I finish my drink, 
I crushed all the ice cubes, the grapefruit was pink, 
I said "how long ya' been", you said "since it was new", 
You said "I've always been" you said "and so have you"
