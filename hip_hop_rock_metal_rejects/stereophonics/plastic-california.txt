plastic california 
looks like blackpool 
outta date 
some love some hate 
it's all your competition 
it's not my occupation true 
but it's what you do 
some love some hate 
i like pink architecture 
flip back my red strip deck chair 
prove we got nothing to prove 
gin stroke amnesia problems 
overhearing talk of hollywood 
we wish we could ya should 
some love some hate 
it's a beautiful place for nature 
and all the beautiful people make it true 
but you look good as you 
some love some hate 
makes me feel great 
i feel new d'ya feel new, ha, ha 
well i'm pleased to meet you
