they're calling out 
come on lets go 
but i'm miles away 
to a year before 
laughs from a glass 
drank to the past 
on the old green seat 
like velvet to the hand 
think i'd like to stay a minute longer 
would you like to stay a minute longer 
last one for some 
sick from the rum 
i play golf on the carpet with someone 
crash back to date 
few things i hate 
but i'd rather us live 
in the present day
