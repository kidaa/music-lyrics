I want to live, I want to give, 
I've been a miner for a heart of gold, 
It's these expressions, that never give, 
That keep me searching for a heart of gold, and I'm getting old. 
They Keep me searching for a heart of gold, and I'm getting old, 

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood, 
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold, 
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line, 
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold, and I'm getting old, 
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold, and I'm getting old, 

Keeps me searching for a heart of gold, 
Keeps me searching and I'm growing old, 
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold, 
I've been a miner for a heart of gold, and I'm getting old
