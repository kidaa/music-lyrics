Going down la la la 
Going down la la la la la 
I used to buy my sweets and candy treats at 
Raymond's shop 
I used to pass there everyday 
The time I as come to buy a gun and hold up 
Raymond's shop 
It looks like I will be going away 
Going down la la la 
Going down la la la la la 
It's been two years my minds not clear 
I stop at Raymond's shop 
It's boarded up he's gone away 
The words got out and there's no doubt it came from 
Raymond's shop 
It looks like I will be going away 
Play away ne ne nay play away 
Its turned about its back on you 
Your famous fifteen times by two 
You ask around to find the truth 
And all the fingers point at you 
You're sick and low, my minds made up 
You're 2 years down I'm back In luck 
I wouldn't save you if you drown 
I hope you like you're time gone down
