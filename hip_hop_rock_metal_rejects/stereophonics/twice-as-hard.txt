Clean as a whistle, smelling like a rose, 
You got your dirty little fingers, bloodshot eyes are gone, 
Tell me I'm wrong, 

Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 
Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 

And no one ever wanna know, love ain't funny, 
A crime in the wink of an eye, 

Your sister always singing, she play the step child, 
A broken little memory, her heart was never kind, 
Tell me I'm blind, 

Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 
Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 

And nobody ever wanna know, love ain't funny, 
A crime in the wink of an eye, 

Blind, you tell me I'm wrong, 

Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 
Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 
Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye, 
Twice as hard, as it was the first time, I said goodbye
