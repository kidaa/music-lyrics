Summertime and the living is easy 
Fish are jumping the cotton is high 
Your daddy's rich and your mother's good lookin' 
So hush little baby and don't you cry. 

One of these mornings your gonna wind up singing 
Your gonna spread your wings and reach for the sky 
But until that mornin' your gonna wind up singin' 
And mommy and daddy are standin' by.
