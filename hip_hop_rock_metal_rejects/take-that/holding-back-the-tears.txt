I kind of keep asking myself little questions 
Like where do I go from here 
I seem to keep loosing track of time and how long it's been 
Since I last had you near 

Been a painful road to a door that's closed 
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win 
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you 
In the mirror there's a sing I must give in 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you 

I used to enjoy spending my time on my own here 
Watching the jaded people pass 
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears 
And walking a road of broken glass 

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night 
It's a war between the present and the past 
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes 
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 

Been a long time since I heard your last goobdye 
Still I hear it clearly every day and night 
What's the point in love when you have to give it up 
Yet still you need it and it's nowhere you can find 

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
tryin' escape the heartache, tryin' escape emotion 
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore 
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time 
I depended on you
