Making my way through photographs 
Of the night when you first stood by my side 
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone 
Good memories of our senior high 
Looking back we're the only couple still together 
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

Our lives have all changed we've come a long long way 
Our faces show the lines of two young songs 
And in their houses there will be pictures 
Like the ones of you and me 
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done 
Never once have I felt the need for another 
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you 

All of the smiles we have won 
Just from looking back and reliving all the good times 
And when we've been through all the pages 
We just start again, oh 

Cause there's nobody else in the world that could love you 
Anymore than I do, always here for you 
Nobody else in the world could love you more 
Nobody could love you anymore than I do 
I'm still here for you
