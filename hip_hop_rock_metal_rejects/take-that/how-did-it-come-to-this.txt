I didn't see it coming 
It took me by surprise 
Just when I wasn't looking 
I noticed all the lies 

And how did it come to this? 
You stabbed me in the back 
How did it come to this? 
You said you were my friend 

You had your own agenda 
But someone starves at home 
I'm sorry I cannot help, but 
The one that starves is the one I love 

And how did it come to this? 
You stabbed me in the back 
How did it come to this? 
Alone with nothing left 
How did it come to this? 
You said you were my friend 
How did it come to this? 
After everything I did 

And how did it come to this? 
You stabbed me in the back 
How did it come to this? 
Alone with nothing left 
How did it come to this? 
You said you were my friend 
How did it come to this? 
After everything I did 

For you 
You said you were my friend 
How did it come to this?
