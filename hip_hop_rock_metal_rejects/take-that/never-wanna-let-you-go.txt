Lying here beside you, in a cloud of warmth 
I've been awake all night but move 
Though I know I should 
Counting curls n your hair, as you sleep so tight 
I wonder if you'll ever know 'till I go 
The chances are you'll be there too some day 
We'll never know, let's hope 

[CHORUS:]
Never wanna let you go 
Never wanna let you go 
All I can do is hope 
'Cause I never wanna let me go 

Dreaming soft in silence, been working hard all day 
Still in the night grows darker, I'm with you in every way 

[CHORUS]

I don't know whether I'm trying to love, love you baby 
Been round long enough to know
