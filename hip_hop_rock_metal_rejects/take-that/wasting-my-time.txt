You've maybe seen me walk behind you 
I follow you just everywhere you go 
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her 
I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

Even now I know it doesn't change me 
Maybe someday you'll be free again 
Till then remember, babe I won't surrender 
Still hurts me when I know you're loving someone else 
Instead of loving me, so I've been 

Wasting my time, running after you girl 
Wasting my time, still I feel a sense of love 
Never be mine, you're someone else's lady 
Always on my mind, that I could steal your love away 

You said you've been missing me 
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl 
Now all our plans that used to be passing us by 
You say I wanna be free
