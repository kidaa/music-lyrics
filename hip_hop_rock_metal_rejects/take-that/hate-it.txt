Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

This is the time I feel it 
Here in the middle of the night 
Still wide awake and feeling cheated 
From a girl I thought was treating me right 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true 

Gotta get away from the feelings I had 
Be real you won't be seeing her again 
It's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
And your girl is still walking away 

Hate it but I love her 
Hate it but I want her 
Feeling like I need her 
Our love, our love was true
