I am just one man with his one pair of eyes 
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart
