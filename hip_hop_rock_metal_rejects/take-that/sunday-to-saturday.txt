Monday morning and the feeling's still the same 
It's our sunday through our saturday love 
This ain't no weekend thing this ain't no teenage game 
It's our sunday through to saturday love 

It's our sunday through to saturday love 
It's our sunday through to saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our sunday through to saturday love 

I have no reason to be feeling kind of strange 
But I guess that's just the man that I am 
In the clouds, in my dreams in pouring rain 
Hand in hand, under this rainbow we can always still the same 

It's our sunday through to saturday love 
It's our sunday through to saturday love 
This ain't no one night stand no part time lovin' man 
It's our sunday through to saturday love
