You hurt my mind, you hurt my soul 
Never believing what I'm saying 
I'll hunt you down, I'll make you mine 
You'll be the game I've started playing 
And if you won't be there I will know where you're going 
And if you won't be there I will try everyway of showing you that 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need 

You understand, you realise 
The scene that I'm creating 
And all the while you compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking 
If you don't believe I want just you and I together 
Then you won't believe the dream of you and I forever because 

You are the one, you are the one 
The one for me 
You are the one, you are the one 
The one I need
