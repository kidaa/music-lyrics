For once in my life I couldnt deny
I thought that Id found my everything,
A lover a friend, the hours we would spend just doing nothing at all, 
Yeah, but your need to leave is your so long, break free let go, 

Butterfly fly, fly away from here 
I know well try, try through the laughter and the tears 
Youll always be a part of me 
In my heart youll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away

Deep in your eyes the stare that I find
All that I really ever need. 
Whatever I do you know that its you girl In every face I see. 
Your last goodbye was your so long break free let go,

Butterfly fly, fly away from here 
I know well try, try through the laughter and the tears 
Youll always be a part of me 
In my heart youll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away

To the place you belong hope you heal the fear and soul 
Hope that you can find the freedom in your life, in your life

Ahh sweet butterfly, just fly away, just fly away  
I know well try, try through the laughter and the tears 
Youll always be a part of me 
In my heart youll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away

For once in my life I couldnt deny, 
I thought that Id found my everything, 
A lover a friend, the hours we would spend just doing nothing at all
