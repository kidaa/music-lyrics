Deceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me 

Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go 
And let my heartaches run free 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
now open wide 

What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 

I thought I knew the meaning of life 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of life 
now open wide
