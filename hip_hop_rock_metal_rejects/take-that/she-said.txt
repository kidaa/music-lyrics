My love
Was filled with trouble
With indecision, therapy and pain

You know that my love
It was going nowhere
It would have driven any normal man insane

Oh, but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you

My love
As bad as fast food
As low as dueces in a gamblers hand

You know that my love
Was long, long hang over
Ain't got no houses or no money or no land

Oh, but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you

Shake it
Everybody now shake it
Everybody just step to the right, jump up, turn around and shake it

Everybody now boogey
Everybody now boogey
Everybody put your hands in the air, turn around everybody
Let's boogey

My love
Was filled with trouble
With indecision, therapy and pain

You know that my love
It was going nowhere
It would have driven any normal man insane

Oh, but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you

She said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you
