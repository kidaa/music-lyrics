I'd watch the world go by in the morning loose myself in the the news,
Looks like the cost of houses are falling but I dont notice
I'd write a long love song with no meaning and hope nobody would hear,
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming. 

[Bridge]
Thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when im looking around with you. 

[Chorus]
Glad you took the time to say hello, hello.
Now I dont ever wanna let you go, oh no, all the bells are ringing out,
All the birds are singing out, glad you took the time to say hello, oh oh oh. 

Id lock myself away in the evening, and rid to ever come out,
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings. 

[Bridge]
Never thort that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when im looking around with you 

[Chorus]
Glad you took the time to say hello, hello.
Now I dont ever wanna let you go, oh no, all the bells re ringing out,
All the birds are singing out, glad you took the time to say hello, oh oh oh. 

Its a lovely day, its a lovely day 

[Bridge]
Never thought that anyone could change my view
But everything looks different when im looking with you 

[Chorus]
Glad you took the time to say hello oh hello
Now I dont ever wanna let you go, let you go, all the bells are ringing out,
All the birds are singing out,
Glad u took the time to say hello, oh oh oh,
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,
All the bells are ringing out all the birds are singing out
Glad you took the time to say hello oh oh oh hello.
