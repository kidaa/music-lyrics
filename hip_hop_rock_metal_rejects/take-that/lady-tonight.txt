The nigth is feeling cold now 
And I must hold now my baby date 
So glad to see you fine you're always on my mind 
But before it gets too late 
We can try love, but if love is not enough 
Then we can take a little walk 
Just to find if our intentions are in time 
Then I can make you baby see that 

Lady tonight I am gonna make it happen 
Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights 
Lady tonight we are gonna feel emotion 
Maybe tonight I will love you and hold you tightly 

Life is what you make it you must shake it to make it right 
Time will always make you see if you believe 
Then things will be alright 
We'll try love and if love is not enough 
We must be destined to be free 
In time you'll feel like giving up 
Then I must make you baby see that 

Lady tonight I am gonna make it happen 
Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights 
Lady tonight we are gonna feel emotion 
Maybe tonight I will love you and hold you tightly
