You can dance if you like 
You can sing every line of every song 
No, you dont have to steal the show 
It was your show all along 

As the orchestra plays 
The people take the seats 
Theres no room left in this house 
Its only you and me 
And if life is your stage 
I'll be watching 

[Chorus]
Hold up a light for me [x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
Ill be watching 
Hold up a light for me [x3]
Hold up a light for me ohhhh 
And I'll be watching you. 

Everything that you do 
As we start, rehearsing every scene 
The words to everything 
We realize that the crowd is listening 
And then the tears, fall down on your face 
In exactly the right place
