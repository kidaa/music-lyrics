Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 

CHORUS: 
So you can do what you like -Do what you like 
No need to ask me -Do what you want 
Do what you like -Do what you like 
No need to tell me -Do what you want 

Cherry pie, you're not as cute as me 
Ice, could never be as cold as you 
Recipe, you stir me up inside 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again
