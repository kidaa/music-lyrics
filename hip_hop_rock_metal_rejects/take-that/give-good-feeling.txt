You've got to hold me, and control my dreams 
I want you to fulfil my needs, I feel it babe 
Something good is gonna happen 
I can't believe in this world I see 
I reach out to you, set me free from these chains 
I'm holding on, trying hard 
Just so you know I'm here waiting for you to 

[CHORUS:]
Give good feeling to me 
Baby I know this feeling won't go 
Makes you want to be free 
In a world where we fly, fly, fly 

Don't let me go, I will be your prisoner 
Hold me down and I will give you my reasons for 
Loving you, needing you, can't do without ya 
If you think I'm crazy for loving you baby 
Then I will show you the feeling 
Holding on, trying hard 
Just so you know I'm here waiting for you to 

[CHORUS]
