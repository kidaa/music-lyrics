Up and down 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see me down life's highway 

Not black or white 
As chrystal clear as a cloudy night 
Traveling in the name of lonely 
I was only home when you held me 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to. 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear. 

Flying home tonight 
As far away as a satelite 
Keeping your heart in my pocket 
Hope to God that I don't drop it 

Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come bursting through my door 

And it's here, 

where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to is here 
All the things I keep so dear 
I hear 

Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time to come home 
Oh what a time to come back 
Oh what a time 

Up and down, 
I love a merry-go-round 
You went your way, I went my way 
Said you'll see my down life's highway 

yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To emerge from the shadows 
yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time 
To come knocking at my door 

And it's here, 
Where I've come home to 
Right here 
Everything I hold on to 
Is here 
All the things I keep so dear I hear 

Everybody's talking now 
Everybody's walking 'round 
Everybody's dreaming 'bout
