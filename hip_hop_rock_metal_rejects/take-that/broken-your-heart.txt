It's good to be near you, even though I'm alone 
Reviving memories of our happy home 
No sign of sunlight since you ran away 
These rooms get darker now every day 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me 
Will you still love me 

The consequences of freedom 
But now you have what you dreamed 
Just understand that things are not as they seem 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me 
Will you still love me 

I don't wanna be lonely 
Because you're not there for me to be 
I don't wanna be lonely 
I wanna be loved 

Even though I have broken 
Even though I have broken your heart 
Will you still love me 
Will you still love me
