I'm out 

Doing all the things you wanted but baby you say
Can you do it this can you do it that while I'm away
In the top drawer there's a list of things that you need
Watcha gonna say watcha gonna do, baby I'll leave
She's serious when she says Things that must be done before I come home
She's serious when she says No time for playing 'round
I'm serious such a mess Such a mess I know it must be time now
Serious now's the time To show you who I am

I'm out
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
I'm out
You don't wanna believe me no more
You just gonna cause me pain
I'm out
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
I'm out
This is the last time I'll be a player in your games

Said you couldn't think how you need to work like a slave
Baby don't get me too hot just to make me behave
Listen to me girl I whisper sweet stuff in your ear
Baby I'm out baby I'm gone catch you next year
She's serious when she says Girl I don't know why it is I need you
So serious when she says No time to fool around
I'm serious such a mess Such a mess I know it must be time now
I'm serious now's the time To show you who I am

I'm out
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
I'm out
You don't wanna believe me no more
You just gonna cause me pain
I'm out
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
I'm out
This is the last time I'll be a player in your games

She's serious when she says Girl I don't know why it is I'm here
So serious when she says No time to fool around
I'm serious such a mess Such a mess I know it must be time now
Serious now's the time To show you who I am

I'm out
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
I'm out
You don't wanna believe me no more
You just gonna cause me pain
I'm out
