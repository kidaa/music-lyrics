Baby I'm watching you to see 
I don't like the way you've been treating me 
I promised you nothing and gave you much more 
Making love is all you wanted me for 

You're never satisfied, you're never satisfied 
If you open your mind you'll see 
That you could be satisfied with me 

Baby you criticize my every move 
Look, can't you see I've nothing to prove 
I've had enough, it's a matter of time 
Maybe we'll make it somewhere down the line 

You can be if you wanna be [x 3]

I often wonder what I see in you 
You don't do the things that I want you to do 
I open my eyes and dream it's alright 
Maybe we'll make it together tonight.
