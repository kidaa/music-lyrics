I'm mad at you, because af all the things you do 
I want you to see the way your games are hurting me 
So why did I ever fall in love with you 
You're all of my nightmares and dreams come true 

What can I do to make you talk this problem through 
You said you've nothing to hide 
So let me hear your feelings inside 
I never dreamed that I'd see this kind of thing in my life 
So baby, plase let me go, let me go 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

All I can see are staring eyes of mistery 
I've tried to look behind before you take my dignity and pride 
We sit and talk all night, still you never seem to lose your height 
You believe in yourself, I hope I'm never gonna need your help 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too 

You don't want me, you don't need me, I got news now 
Cos baby I'm watching you 

Whatever you do to me 
Somebody else will do to you 
However you break my heart 
Somebody else will break yours too
