The strings of silence - hushed
The strings of silence - smooth
Withina few hours all signs will read storm
                Listen!
An endless high pulsating evil
Is rising from the cone
A magical miraculous horn
Of a unicorn whose top gets lost in infinity
The storm of hell never halts there
It drives the ghosts and demon`s in it`s vortex
Everlasting, fot the fatal and
The glorious return of our master...
Onwards, onwards... to hell, to hell
I was torture, death and fatal spell
Thrones and dominions mean nothing to me
As long as I seek the truth
Thus I break man and ice
On my journey towards beyound
A source of tranquility
Paralysed oceans formed by skulls
Pandemonic outbreaks cause chaos
Chaos within the universe
Blood for Satan - tears for God!
Within this astral pain I`ll never be the same
Throwing myself to the sky
While falling to the ground
UTOPIA CONSUMED!
The dark silhouettes move towards me
As I confess the morbid desire
And I witness all the falling souls consumed
No flame burns brighter than desire
Lust and passion, and pain as sinfull gift
Wildfire in the heart of man - uncontrolable
I`m the creature set ablaze with God`s sin
A newborn day waits to surrect
But what will cover dawn?
Neither begging nor pleading will find ears
When all the anel hordes have gone to war
For a final twisted dance
A twisted dance - into death
So let us bring and end to this
I lead the first strike to eternity
While the sun and moon fall down
Between my fingers - subconscious
Glass like tunnels reveal
Upon this widom`s flame...
The flame, a shivering mirror
That reflects my bonelike face
Bloodred are enlightened my bleak eyes
Eyes that saw worlds crash into the void
The void, an empty abyss you call reality
And I settle down in the crystal throne
but is this really what I am striving for?
An everlasting existence
Without any challenge
