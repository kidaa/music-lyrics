Awakening although I thought I would never again
In a room with no beginning or end
But for sure there is a centre
Nothing but vastness and an object of supreme magic
A mirror shaped as a pyramid
Black but still refelcting
My hands and arms, but not my face
I'm watching myself moving towards this blasphemy
Attracted I float nearer and nearer
Tryin to step aside but my journey ends behind the glass
A sea coloured red is awaiting me there
Everything is upside down
Am I destined to drown
Surfaces belong to other dimensions
Hell is above and heaven awaits far below
Deeper and deeper i sink and scream without sound
Unrealistic reality or a dream in the state of being awake
For sure this will be my greatest victory or my final defeat
If I am demon all the angels must die
