ACT I : Ritual
Red interludium of pain
Sacrifice for the vein of eternity
Battles of ages revealed to my third eye
Darkness' treasures as reward for my belief
I faint in final ecstasy
Surrender to the demon of war
ACT II : Redemption
Proud and dauntless I stalk
Through the gate of the nine seals
In the realm of perpetual divinity
A path is destined for me
Now, as I'm not blinded by gruesome lights of the past
i gaze into the distance and perceive my destination
For many a castle of obscurity
For me a palace of wisdom
Redeemed from mortal weakness, enlightened
ACT III : Return
Every single christian monument
We lay in ruins
And sweep away the servants of the cross
We are the creators of the dark ages
The revival of forgotten century's eclipse
We rebuilt a sombre paradise out of the wastland of God
i bear the millenium's pain
Pure indulgence as my mouth opens breathing death
