Kicking your ass off the turf
Don't try to fight it, it ain't gonna work
Fuck no, it isn't, no way I'm missing
This time your going down
Fusion, a megaton load
Release of anger I'm cleansing my soul
bout time I did collision you're hit
You need to get knocked out
Another time, another place
and the faces are never the same
Every yard that I take I deserve you mother
Rush in, I break through the line
I'm running though ya, cause the ball is mine
I'm gonna take it, you can't protect it
I'll live to see your termination
Crushing I'm ready to kill
No time for thinking adrenaline fill
It's what's expected, won't be rejected
Don't get in front of me
Blitz
Over the middle, you hear the footsteps
Over the middle, you see me flying
The power of God, the money, brutality
Pressure is on, the game is no game to me
High impact collision, pure determination
Blitz
Full contact collision my exhilaration
Punching' out on the field
Knocked out unconscious, cause this is for real
No hesitation, no competition
I said you're going down
Fusion, a megaton load
Release of anger, I'm cleansing my soul
Bout time I did it, collision you're hit
You just sit the fuck down
Blitz
