Tripping in dimension, never dared to see this far
Projected through my mind's eye
Brilliant light, blinding sight, burning
Nullified and stone cold, something wants to rape my soul
Running from the vile
Evil Force, Fight it off, must resist
Soaring through the sky, there's a demon in my mind
Blasting of my soul, I lay sleeping, body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of - Out of body out of mind
Out of - Out of body in my mind
Wicked is the power hunting me, the spirits prey
Tenacious and persistent, won't give in, can't give up, never
Facing off to lay claim
Time could soon run out for me
Warring with the demon
Vicious cries, sinful eyes, crave what's mine
Soaring through the sky, there's a demon in my mind
Blasting of my soul, I lay sleeping, body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of - Out of body out of mind
Out of - Out of body in my mind
Drift from my world to the other
Demon screaming out for me
Lost my earthly foothold, failed to win back my soul
Everything is gone now
Won't get back, can't get back, never
Floating off to nowhere, cursed to drift on endlessly
There's no life, there's no death
Just hell
Soaring through the sky, there's a demon in my mind
Blasting of my soul, I lay sleeping, body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of - Out of body out of mind
Out of - Out of body in my mind
Out of mind
In my mind
Out of body
Thrust from my world to the other
Lost and gone forever in my hell
My hell
