Running like hell away from the smell
Hot blast out your ass that they're talking with
cavity creep looking for victims
Band over and over to give you the fist
Making it hurt all the way through ya
Making you feel like your less of a man
System of pain, obey the system
You pay to play with you ass in the air
So they say
Sense of nothing
Nothing makes sense
Death and taxes
Love your tax man
So that's the way
Law of the land, scum sucking maggots
Eating the meat off the bones that they pick
Making it known that they are your master
Then breaking you faster than you brought it in
So they say
Sense of nothing
Nothing makes sense
Death and taxes
Love your tax man
So that's the way
Bankrupt, corrupt
Dollars and no sense
Explode, unload
I'm gonna take it back
Bankrupt, corrupt
Dollars and no sense
Implode, reload
You better watch your ass
Greed hand open low man pay plan
greased hand closing greed man pay plan
Running like hell away from the smell
Hot blast out your ass
That your living with
Law of the land, scumsucking maggots
Eating the meat off the bones that they pick
Making it known that they are you master
Then breaking you faster than you brought it in
System of pain, obey the system
You pay to play with your ass in the air
So they say
