Pains incisions, severed in all eyes
Paralyzing vision, TV philosophy
Turn it on, it will turn you off
While the eye of you minds weakens
Dreaming
Laughing, crying
So on goes the picture denying
We watch hypnotized
Addicted to lies
What we see is electric disguise
I am hypnotized
Rhythm insane
Mechanical pulsating brain
Channels changing, nothing changing
Re-deranging, warping reality
Turn it off, it will turn you on
It's the drug of our time
Mesmerizing
Living Dying 
So on goes the picture denying
We watch hypnotized
Addicted to lies
What we see is electric disguise
I am hypnotized
Hypnotized
Addicted to lies
What we see is electric disguise
We're all hypnotized
Hypnotized by the rhythm
Mechanical pulsating brain
