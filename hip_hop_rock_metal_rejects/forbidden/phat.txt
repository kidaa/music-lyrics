Raw
Step to the plate or sit the fuck down and watch
Living to please ourselves
Burned
Rising up we will show the whole fucking world no
Nothing will keep us down
Try to write us off, write us off
Never giving up, never gonna give in
Try to kill us off
Never giving up, we never give
Fast
Ripping on trends cause they're used up whores it's slow
That's how we die on the floor
Fuck
Mad at the world, not bitter and weak, hell no
Nothing can keep this done
Try to write us off, write us off
Never giving up, never gonna give in
Try to kill us off
Never giving up, we never give
Punching out the clock and our music is the paycheck
Living for ourselves we don't care about the outside world
Crawling out the cage, now the dog is gonna get some meat
Torn
The pain we must endure
Lies
Putting an end to the crap that you've heard cause now
Nothing will keep us down
Try to write us off, write us off
Never giving up, never gonna give in
Try to kill us off
Never giving up, we never give
Feed us..fetus..fetus..feed us
