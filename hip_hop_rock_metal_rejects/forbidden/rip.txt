We've always been told to stand up tall
"Guard the nation"
This killing force that we have made, what for?
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
the Mother Earth
It always seems that we're all fighting
We don't know what it's worth
Close the door as they beg for more
Children cry as they're left to die
See the t4ears running down their faces
See compassion is at end
Mother Earth is crying
Rest in peace
Peace
Who can you believe? It's never what it seems
Feel the anger
They're tightening the vice, now who pays the price?
We will
I am saddened by this selfishness and "Who cares"
Attitude
Put down your arms and stop this fighting
Save our Mother Earth
Close your eyes, say your last goodbyes
Self-destruct, we've run out of luck
See the lights turn to darkness
Realize there is no hope
The human race is dying
Rest in peace
Peace
Desperate is what we've all become
Helpless, there's nowhere left to run
Crushing the spirit of mankind
Forbidding what's yet to come
We've always been told to stand up tall
"Guard the nation"
This killing force that we have made, what for?
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
the mother earth
It always seems that we're all fighting
We don't know what it's worth
Who will drop the curtain?
Who will end earth's history?
No more "Happy ever after"
Rest in peace
Peace
