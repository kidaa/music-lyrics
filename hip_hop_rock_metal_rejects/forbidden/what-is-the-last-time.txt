Did you notice the sun had turned orange for the last time?
The last time...
Did you notice the moon on the seventh day?
The last time...
did you see the people gathering for the last time?
A past time...
And did you notice the rose, it has bloomed for the last time?
The last time...
Who truly understand the meaning of the symbols we're given?
It's a given
One bites the apple while another drinks unholy water
What is forbidden couldn't stop us from digging deeper
The dam is breaking, it won't hold us back any longer
Don't try to stop it cause the Sistine Chapel is gonna burn
