Green - it's never enough
Different shades bought and sold, illusion control
Extortion incest
Greed - it's never enough
They're building us up while they're tearing us down
On their hands is the blood of the ones who had made them
Praise them, save them, break them
Eyes - they watch from inside
So in God do we trust? Paranoid? Not enough
Do you think that it's near?
Yes I do I can feel it
You can't believe in them or what they say
Their colors change
We should have never let them get away
My brothers
Green is in their eyes, green surrounds you
Lies, his story, our past
A lesson not learned, never changed, never learned
Passing on one by one to the lost generation
You can't believe in them or what they say
Their colors change
We should have never let them get away
My brothers
Save them, praise them, break them
True colors
