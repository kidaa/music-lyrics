Faces of life facing their death
Cyanide thrills pulling em back
Snake in the grass, face in the clouds
Facing the wind, a face in the crowd
Throughout your frustration
Go along with all the fucking lies
Can't help your situation - WHY?!
Doing it up, you never come down
Digging the hole, you're dead in the ground
Facing your front while flat on your back
Laughing it up now cover the tracks
Scratch off the crustation
never kills any pain that you hide
Might help your situation
But you don't even care about it
Can't live without, don't want to think about it
You can't live without, you don't' care about shit
When the first time that you got so high
Did you ever think you'd slide so low
Swimming up into a liquid sky will drown you
Razor-mirror
Spoonfed killer
Face down hero
How can you laugh about it?
Putting your back in front of your forth
Turning your right until no one is left
Got to the end before you could start
Breaking what's fixed until you were broken
Faces of life, faces of death
Facing yourself, a distorted reflection
How do you see, how does it feel
Looking through your eyes?
Throughout your frustration
Go along with all the fucking lies
Can't help your situation - WHY?!
When the first time that you got so high
Did you ever think you'd slide so low
Swimming up into a liquid sky will drown you
Razor-mirror
Spoonfed killer
Face down hero
How can you laugh about it?
What do you care about
You can't live without
You don't care about...
