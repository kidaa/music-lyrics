In your face written in, carved in stone
Here comes that feeling once again
Pop the lid, down we go
Falling fast though the undertow
Missing link crossing path
Bleeding eyes see your fractured past
Point of your vision clear
You'll never...
Cut to the point leaving nothing to hide
Nothing to hide
Out of breath, out of time
You're out of time
You opened it up just to see what's inside
What's inside?
Seek your truth limb to limb
You'll wish you never asked again
Piled up in your mind asked again
Piled up in your mind you'll never...
Level the wall that you've built up inside
Pushed to far this time
Should have never opened it
Just couldn't let it sit
Should of never questioned it
Should of never opened that can of worms
When you popped the lid they crawl across the floor
Watch em writhing everywhere
They're everywhere
When you popped the lid did they fall across the floor
Watch em crawling everywhere
Pop the lid and down we go
It's everywhere, they're everywhere
pop the lid so now you know
They're everywhere, it's everywhere
They're everywhere
