Selection, perversion, infection
Violation, elevation, desecration
Bleed on me
I've taken all your trust in me
and thrown it away
Plead for me
I've stained your pride
But you still want me to stay
I'll pick you up and throw you down
Shove your face into the ground
I'll make you sick and make you crawl
Walk, run, fall
Rape
Bleed on me
Painless injection of apathy
Needing me
Comedy of the tragedy
I'll break you in and break you down
Watch you fade without a sound
I'll make you sick and make you crawl
Walk, run, fall
There's something real
I know you feel it
Do you feel it?
I have a secret
You must embrace it
You'll have to face it
I'll tell the truth
You know you like it
I know you'll love it
You know it's time
The seed was planted
Bleed on me....BITCH
Rape
Bleed on me
I've taken all your trust in me
and thrown it away
Plead for me
I've stained your pride
But you still want me to stay
I'll pick you up and throw you down
Shove your face into the ground
I'll make you sick and make you crawl
Walk, run, fall
Rape
