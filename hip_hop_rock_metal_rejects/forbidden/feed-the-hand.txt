Will the sun rise up in the morning?
Could you answer that for me my friend?
Should I even believe in tomorrow?
Who will answer that for me?
Who can I trust among the ones
who will say they're my kind?
Pulling me in, again and again
Holding me down just like the beginning
I told you my feelings the other night
You said I'm insane underneath your breath
I tried to explain that it's time to fight
You game me a million reasons
Why am I wrong?
Why am I lost?
Waving some flag for a cause, don't believe in
Eat their words
Understand
Live the life
Feed the hand
The blood, the blood
on the hands of the one who has covered the sun
The sun, falls to the sea
Look what we've done
It's done
Closing my eyes
I've seen all the lies
The lies
I told you my feelings the other night
You said I'm insane underneath your breath
I tried to explain that it's time to fight
You game me a million reasons
Why are you wrong?
Why are you lost?
Waving some flag for a cause, don't believe in
Eat their words
Understand
Live the life
Feed the hand
