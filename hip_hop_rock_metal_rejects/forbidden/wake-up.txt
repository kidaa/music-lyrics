Wake up
Peel the lids back from you eyes
Now take a look
Stand up
Spitting in the face of fear
Break out
now's the time to find your way
Alone you're stillborn
move on
Take your place in what will be
Rise up
From the ashes
Pull away, accept no silence
Wake up
Do it for humanity
They say that life's what you make of it
And we're to blame
Soon they'll all know that we're tired of it
It's time for change
Break off hostility
Expose obscenity
Unreal reality
Wake up humanity
Take on
Screaming in the 
face of those who steal the world
Away from
Innocent unconscious prey
War's on
Take a chance
Pushing in renounce all bullshit
War's won
Only if we fight....fight!
They say that life's what you make of it
And we're to blame
Soon they'll all know that we're tired of it
It's time for change
Break off hostility
Expose obscenity
Unreal reality
Wake up humanity
Believe not a word from the damned
The skeptic and cynic must stand
Weary faith in their eyes
What we see are the lies
Demand justice, now justice
