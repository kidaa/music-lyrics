Step by step it's happening, it's slowly eating you
Numbing your mind to the pain
You broke the rule, the payment's cruel
Selfish road, you paved the way
Hiding in your fantasy, it's easier to lie
The choice you made could kill
You're just one lonely victim
A wasted life
Don't you feel as if you walls fall in?
The way you live could put you underground
Step by step, by step
Surviving hanging by a thread
Step by step, by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step, by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step, by step
It just gets worse until you pull through
Screaming out, you cry for love, they only toss you out
Rejected, lost in a daze
It's all so cold, do as you're told
Hit your knees now start to pray
Dream about a time before, securely locked away
Within your heart is the key
If you don't open up then - 
You'll lose your life
Don't you feel as if you walls fall in?
The way you live could put you underground
Step by step, by step
Surviving hanging by a thread
Step by step, by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step, by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step, by step
It just gets worse until you pull through
Deep inside you're selfish and infected with desire
Filled your head with dreams that died
Just couldn't get no higher
Look at what you've become - synthetic, morphite cyst
Your luck's run out, the thread has snapped
A cold depressing end
Don't you feel as if you walls fall in?
The way you live could put you underground
Step by step, by step
Surviving hanging by a thread
Step by step, by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step, by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step, by step
It just don't' stop
Step by step, by step
Don't try to run before you walk
Step by step, by step
Do it for yourself kid
Step by step, by step
It's just the way you have to learn
Step by step, by step
By step by step by step by step
