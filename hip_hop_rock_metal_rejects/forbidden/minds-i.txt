The trip begins again
I can't release the voices, never be the same
Silence is my friend...no more
Mind's "I"
I can't take anymore, choking on my apathy
Words that I say don't mean a damn thing to me
Someone else is in here, hiding
Pain is truth, the truth is painful
"I" the one in constant carnage
"I" the two behind the mask
Living in here within my consciousness
Awaken me from the voices of my obsession
Awaken me
"I" of mind's eye
"I" of the storm
The Trip begins again
"I" abandon you and who you are inside
A part of me apart from you
We are dust, the walls we've seen will fall
Forever
"I" of mind's eye
"I" of the storm
"I" the one beyond redemption
"I" the two without the mask
The world we see, the world we see
Has turned on you, on you, and me
The trip begins again
