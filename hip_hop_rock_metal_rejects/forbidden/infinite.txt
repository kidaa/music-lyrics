Quest for truth never ceases
As wisdom brutally teaches
Pacing back and forth again and again
Just searching for an end
Panic wave chaos showers
Sickening stench of man gone sour
Laughing at us in our face, we're disgraced
and then we're all erased
Persevere - Holding out - Make it end
Giving in - Giving up - Let it end
Why is it infinite?
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing never changing
Why is it infinite?
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing never changing
Nothing changes
Pressure point, burning rage
No turning back, no release from this cage
One man calls the other one a liar
There's fire escalating higher
Endless wars, lost causes
Only letting up for brief pauses
Time repeats this circle of madness
Repetition of constant sadness
Persevere - Holding out - Make it end
Giving in - Giving up - Let it end
Why is it infinite?
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing never changing
Why is it infinite?
The evil
The always changing never changing
Nothing changes
Analyze - Cut to shreds
Overweight yet underfed
Food for thought, no answer to our questions
Save your breath - waste no words
Undescript, it's so absurd
Wisdom sits beyond our meager minds
Infinite
