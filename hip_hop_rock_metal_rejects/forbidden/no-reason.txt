Don't explain to me your philosophy
Cause when you're cut you bleed the same as I do
Understand there is no understanding
Where I've been is who I am
Pain is real
Pain does not heal
Pain is what they make you feel
Do you feel it?
Go - Can you stop it?
No - Can you take it?
Go - Don't need no reason
No - Do you feel it?
Go - Can you stop it?
No - Don't need no reason
Now
Son of a bitch lying there
Knife in his back
Out of my face
The cause??
Don't need no reason
What's done is done
Don't need no reason
The cause??
