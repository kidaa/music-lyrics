i'm dreaming it so it must be true 
nothing else could look as good as you do 
and so we're a rocket goal 
up to where the astros flow into space 
don't hold me down
atom eyes 
don't worry your brain 
take a break from everyday 
sell the house, the car, the pain 
atom eyes
i'm running away from your blues 
atom eyes with sprinklers are spraying perfume 
escape from the part of me 
there's a million heartstrings ready to fly 
let's pull them now
atom eyes 
don't worry your brain 
take a break from everyday 
sell the house, the car, the pain 
atom eyes
just be sure to live again 
atom eyes 
don't worry your brain 
take a break from everyday 
sell the house, the car, the pain
