roll out of bed 
they're issuing lives for redmen and their wives 
offering hands
and twiddling thumbs, for dreams that never come 
often said 
you better not look away, you'll lose the day 
the way i see it 
it's already lost 
so then be it, they say 
they're sharpening knives 
and primitive lives, for redmen and their wives 
bread winners and klutz 
and losing it all before the one eye shuts 
well i see it 
as paying the price, nobody feels it these days 
well i'd like to go 
and kiss them away 
well i'd like to know 
another way 
did you notice that 
they're taking back lives from redmen just to 
give them time to find the light 
and other things that bind with pride 
a killer's waking up this time 
to honest gleam and needless pride 
we'll never see it shine 
we'll never find the time 
we'll never see it shine 
we'll never find the time...
