They should never take you away 
Not with all the little lines you say 
Especially when you make them laugh 
Come with me - believe in what you're making me 
Baby, out of sadness there is pain 
But your barrage of little lines is making me 
Change now 
Philosophers and critics of the play 
We listen hard to every word we say 
Especially when it makes us laugh 
Outside the ordinary
