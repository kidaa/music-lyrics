Fly into ashes a hole
They will polish you brightly wherever you go
Their ashes come true
They'll bring knowledge unto you wherever you know
Unofficial study guides will help you when you're ready boy
Superficial lacerations they won't hurt you
Exert you into growing out
Fly into ashes a hole
They will follow you into wherever you flow
To ashes so slow that the knowledge you acquire to help you
Ceilings now are clawing gold
They need something reverent and bold
Holding out for the heaven to unfold
Unofficial study guides will help you when you're ready boy
Superficial lacerations they won't hurt you
Exert you into growing out
Ceilings now are clawing gold
They need something reverent and bold
Holding out for the heaven to unfold
