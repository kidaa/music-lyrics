Makes good sense to me 
Proud men wear it only 
Brings good company 
How am I so lonely 
So run away 
The sun is outside of a world at play 
Awaiting the solid gold display 
Mysterious engines run 
To keep the dream from ending 
To cloak obscures the gun 
To keep what's worth defending 
The best of days 
The ones to remember are crumbling now 
The vandals come for rummage 
Affordable trends in anxiety 
Especially the ones that make you raw 
Portable men's society! 
Now I mention these things
