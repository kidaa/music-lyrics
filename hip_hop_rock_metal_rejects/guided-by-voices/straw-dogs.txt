We've been burned out
Concerned out
Discerned out
We've been sought out
'Cause we can't believe our eyes
We are the willing supporters
And we'd like to know
Why everything is so unkind
We've been sent in
Defending the one thing
Cause it's our duty
We've got to find out why
We are the willing supporters
And we'd like to know
Why everything is so unkind
We really should be fine, yeah
