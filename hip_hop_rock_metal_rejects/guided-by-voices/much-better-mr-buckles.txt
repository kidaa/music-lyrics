Time is ";gone out";
If you pick up the weekend
Precisely, do you see?
The weak ones of a shifting ethic
Are packing up
So:
Let me know if you go
Much Better Mr. Buckles
The kind nod of his employment
Wishes you well
Slow and unsure
Do unfurl your lips and call me
Entice me - take a drink
The sick list of a cryptic print
Is whited out
So:
Let me know if you go...
