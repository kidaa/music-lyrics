Someone tell me why I do the things 
That I don't wanna do 
When you're around me I'm somebody else 
Someone tell me why I act like a fool 
When things don't go my way 
When you're around me I'm somebody else
There is good reason I guess 
Having once gone too far 
When you clean out the hive 
Does it make you want to cry 
Are you still being followed by the teenage FBI
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why I do the things 
That I don't wanna do 
When you're around me I'm somebody else 
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why
