Think of a no parking zone
Where armored cars keep the street
And every heart seeks inspiration
It is full to maximum capacity
Leave your things in the streets
And run wild
Wooden heads on the chopping block
And other hearts pumping ink
That spills out over dreams of antiquity
Pale but full of ghostly charm
Leave your things in the streets
And run wild
