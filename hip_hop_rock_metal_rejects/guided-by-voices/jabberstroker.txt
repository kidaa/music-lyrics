I didn't get much of this song, which is a shame, because Tobin sounds so overwrought whilst singing what sounds to be total gibberish.
One more, man! Yeah! One more! Blah blah.... 
Cling to the spring boy 
Lost a couple of cells in jail 
BB groovy with matter on a sailing sky 
Enliven jabberstroker
Sinking around you now 
Around you now 
Around you now 
Sinking around you now 
Around you now 
Around you now
Wings the wise nail, boy 
Found a people ?? bell worth ??? fighting for 
Take the fast track, fucker 
Assess your privilege and take the fast track 
He's the one with the talking rock bowl 
Clings to the edge of the pool 
Brett/Bread Gace/Gays/Gaze ??? 
Seven number ones 
The cause of banners 
Found the chick to protect fighting for 
Around you now 
Around you now 
Around you 
Sing it boy 
Around you now 
Around you now 
Around
On a silent sky, the night, the fast rack, think of it lightly boy, ?? 
lost track of what they were saying
Dig the fast track bubble 
Dig the fast track bubble 
Dig the fast track bubble 
Dig the fast track bubble
