cold hands touching my face
don't hide - the snake can see you
old friends you might not remember
fading away from youthe goldheart mountaintop queen directorythe goldheart mountaintop queen directory
and we looked 
and we passed
through the hallways of shatterproof glass
she runs through the night as if nobody cares
she screams and she cries and ignores all the stares
she wants me to come, but i'm never going there
