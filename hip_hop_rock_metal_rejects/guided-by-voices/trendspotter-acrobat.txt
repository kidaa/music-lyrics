Trendspotter acrobat got no fallin' room 
Chocking on an ego size of a ?? rooms 
Shows the trends on his coat 
Walks out in the rain 
Dismayed to see it hasn't rained in days 
I will buy the drinks if you promise not to ask me what I think
Hogbutcher diplomat throws up on his shoes 
Burpin' up an epigram got these from wounds 
Shows the trend on his coats 
staggers through the shine 
Say us through the shine 
A million bedtime stories on his mind 
I will buy the drinks if you promise not to ask me what I think
Trendspotter acrobat look at my new clown clown 
Falling apart is as easy as sitting down 
Slowly peels off his coat 
Throws it on the floor 
Nothing really matters anymore 
I will buy the drinks if you promise not to tell me what you think
