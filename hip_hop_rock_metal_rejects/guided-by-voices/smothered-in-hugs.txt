in the summer that you came
there was something eating everyone
and the sunshine fund was low
we couldn't greet you
with a simple hello
and the watchers of the flood
were busy in their chambers
making sure there was new blood
to sustain their dying veins
but i believed you
no need for further questioning
i'm gonna leave with you
you can teach me all you know
which way will we go now
on our trip to taller windows
i really don't know now
i really don't know
in the winter that you left
there was business as usual
with the same old fears and frustrations
but the word got out
it was really such a pity
but the judges and the saints
and the textbook committee
decided you should be left out
not even mentioned
but i believed you
no need for further questioning
i'm gonna leave with you
you can teach me all you know
which way will we go now
on our trip to taller windows
i really don't know now
i really don't know
