come on, polluted eyeballs 
stop scouting out the fields 
jump up, bright paper werewolves 
and everybody, everywhere
anyone can scratch 
and anyone can win 
so pull out another batch
they want to get out of here
but they can't find the exits 
they cling to the cinema
and they can't find security 
then they finally got recognized 
so they left in obscurity and misery
