why is it every time i think about you
something that you have said or implied makes

as if it never meant anything to me
parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain

but there's a ghost in my room
and he says i better run
it's a thing i know - it's a thing i believe in
won't you tell it to go away?
