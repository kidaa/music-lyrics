find deep within the old memory coat 
a cricket bag you ate from 
its sweet smiling apology 

acceptance awaits you 
don't be afraid to cherish it
look it up in the bookmobile 
look it up in the gun rack 
in the magazine rack, and the map 
for it is only after the fence comes down 
that the cartoon bubble explodes 
and the new party begins 
invitation only in stealing a senator's suitcase
let them out and dance for the ant-god 
like scary magnets
to pounce upon command 
upon the man, the man called aerodynamics
