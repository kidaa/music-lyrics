Living without you is difficult
But our dead dreams awake
In mushroom art
Do not observe her beauty
Cloud faced oldman winking
You see, he tests me
He wants I should join him
in gratitude
For his craft
He calls this love
But hardly so
Happy the universe
Happy is the act
A bejeweled crow on a quilted tent
Yea, at the zenith
Our dead dreams awake
