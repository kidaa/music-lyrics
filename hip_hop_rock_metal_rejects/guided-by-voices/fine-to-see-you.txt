It's was sure fine to see you
Delicious and thank you for coming
There is nowhere to go but up
You know that for I tell you
All of our friends are thinking about us
The cup is running over
I am hypnotizing the highway
I am baptizing mad rivers
And the rivers run wild
And the highway is long
It was so good to see you
You know that for I tell you
