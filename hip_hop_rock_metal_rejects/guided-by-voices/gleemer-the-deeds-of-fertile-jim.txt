I'm sitting on 2 heads
";Some seat"; I heard some said
Just waiting for Sunday
Four days after Wednesday
The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim
Could this be a brand new low
One that we can't talk about
One that we can't live without
One that we can join in now
I'm standing on 2 feet
Now buried in concrete
Just waiting for sundown
So as to be not found
The higher clouds...
