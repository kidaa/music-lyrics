Oh yeah going to drive my car
Oh yeah going to go real far
ase sit down the final stages
Staring at the screen as the battle rages
You were finding out ?  in the dictionary
Taking photographs in the cemetary
Oh yeah going to drive my car
Oh yeah going to go real far
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
the worst offense is intelligence
the best defense is belligerance
how we stalemate our predicament
governed by tissue and filament
Oh yeah going to drive my car
Oh yeah going to go real far
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your crowd or clout?
Beyond the secrets of this world
beyond the Montezuma Halls
