drag days are not so bad but move too slow 
if i were them i'd want them not to linger so 
now we come to drag days 
now we come to drag days
fake capes baby, they're too hard to wear 
put them on and everyone will stare 
we have come to drag days 
we have come to drag days 
we escape them sometimes and the feeling is different, more intensified 
we escape them within the walls of our fidgety hearts where we hide
away, on out beyond the factory yards 
up and over the security guards 
we have come to drag days 
we have come to drag days 
we escape them sometimes and the feeling is different, more intensified 
we escape them within the walls of our fidgety hearts where we hide
they will turn around 
they will turn around...
