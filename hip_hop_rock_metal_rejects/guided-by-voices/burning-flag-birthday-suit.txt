don't open life alone 
contact the empire, salutionaries 
they cut the skin, they peel back the onion 
reveal the ghost blood, fat black gas 
excudes, moves into the mirrored halls of empty values
can sister, high over 
drive me, to the changing room 
where the counterfeit reads 
and brings its collections of orphans
meet them in the stale crypt
although it says, hate them 
it's up to you and me
my faithful cynthia 
to give them the glorious life back and 
remove them back here
the burning flag birthday suit
