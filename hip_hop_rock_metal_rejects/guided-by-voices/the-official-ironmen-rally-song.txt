bitter fish in crude oil sea 
you don't have to bother me 
you just have to join on this song
crawling people on your knees 
don't take this so seriously 
You just have to hum it all day long
to dine, alone 
to build a private zone 
or trigger a synapse 
and free us from our traps
you won't see me turn my back 
with my head against my stack 
spinning deep and broken open skin 
official ironman you are free 
champions officially, but 
you won't catch me on an open chin
to dine, alone 
to build a private zone 
or trigger a synapse 
and free us from our traps
knockout punches for the freaks 
happy little babies with red cheeks 
you will rock them gently out of sync 
confirmations through the wire 
spitting gas into the fire 
am i also worthy of a drink?
to dine, alone 
to build a private zone 
or trigger a synapse 
and free us from our traps
