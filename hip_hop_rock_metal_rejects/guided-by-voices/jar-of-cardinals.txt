Droves of growers rolling by
In the trees and way below
Simple factors foiling time
Never did we seem to know
She was high and I was low
Sitting in our bungalow
Eating something wonderful
Never ever getting full
Nests of crows are hoarding coins
In the competition zone
Hush now seedling, don't you cry
Maybe I'll be coming home quite soon for you
Quite sinful you...
