roll out the pain killers 
we'll have a killer wig out 
sleepy boys don't look 
it's not enough said 
or a statistical ocurrence 
it's octopus, caveman 
drinking with the enemy 
he's got a girl on every arm
he sits down and circulates 
in the office of hearts 
he's case closed middleman 
in the office of hearts 
he'll steal you away
he sits down and circulates
come feel the softest parts 
in the office of hearts
he sits down and circulates
come feel the softest parts 
in the office of hearts...
