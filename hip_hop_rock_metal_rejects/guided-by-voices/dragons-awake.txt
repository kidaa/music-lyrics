Dragons Awake!
Take me through the voodoo, Buddha
You are the King of Things
I am a fake
Over the treetops
An automan
And automatic girl
Predator skin an orangutan alive
I have two eyes
Sprinkle the pearls over the ham
Grand Peter, Might it be the 
Pipes of Pan?
Softer tits will great you
But they have been tapped
By suckers of the sap
Now I'm going home
In the distance I can see them
Proudly waving flags
To separate and free them
Dragons Awake!
Forever and ever
For everyone to see
    -Amen
