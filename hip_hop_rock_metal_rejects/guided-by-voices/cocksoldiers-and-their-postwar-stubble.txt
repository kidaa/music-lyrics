If you could imagine this 
You're not to blame 
This is one thing that you missed 
I know it's not the same
Bend your rules in healing halls 
Poisoned rain 
Of the scavenger of sports 
That you found to be insane
Realize the entertainment 
Rise above the self-containment 
Compromise will be the arrangement 
For the cocksoldiers 
And their postwar stubble 
And dream tonight
repeat all but the second part.
