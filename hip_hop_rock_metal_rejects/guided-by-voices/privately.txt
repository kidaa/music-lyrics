In the midst of this effort
Courageous tongues are bitter
Don't blast them
Bring posters and broadcast
Not a public display
But a new secret
Come there to pretend
Bring your children
Allow them to watch to the end
Before most of us knew it
Contagious words have bitten
Don't use them
Don't post them for broadcast
Keep then private and away
Like an old weapon
Come here on command
Like good children
Allow us to watch 'til to the end
Cigarette lifter
The frozen violins
Solid movement
Privately
