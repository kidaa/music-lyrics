When you're called to the plough 
You will always slide inside her 
If you work really hard 
You will lose yourself and wrong her 
Wait a little longer 
Plough when you feel it 
It's your right-tonight 
And take it slow 
If you grow it will you try it 
You'll be so inspired to go out 
And bring back the only one who matters anyhow 
The logical nod 
Off and running...headbone ringing with animal medicine
