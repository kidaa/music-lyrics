Dancing as their chance passed 
Promoting national trust 
And goose the tunnel for the ditch 
Your jokes are ??swelling whining tracks??
It's a sign of the times 
On Sudden Outburst Radio 
Feed our egos getting our fill 
With the Everything I Want pill
And Andy Paper it is time? 
He's frozen up there on the slips 
And so the minors collapse 
They waste no time lacking guts
Throwing ashes on the fire 
Cause everybody's a star 
Manifesting hypocrites 
In fifty blows, it's quite relaxing
