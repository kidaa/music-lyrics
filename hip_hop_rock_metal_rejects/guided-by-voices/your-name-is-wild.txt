time to say to you, my child 
your name is wild
and if you call me in 
i'll change the color 
your name is wild
and i'll be taking you 
soon now to read the orange signs 
and i say now to you: 
";so what, the useless fade in time";
you chose me to read you no lies 
hooray for the day
and i pay the angels to keep you my child 
you are safe for now
god knows it too
