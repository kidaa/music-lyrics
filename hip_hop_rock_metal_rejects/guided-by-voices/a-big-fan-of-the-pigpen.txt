not this one either
oh, to speak on one's feet
to beat on one's brain
the popular mechanics are at it again
a tenement filled with side-show freaks
assembled to downgrade
an immpeccable arrangement
by the soft-rock renegades
and give me time to light
a sentimental torch tonight
i'm a big fan of the pigpen
sharper than most
cut with exacto
gone is all good
ex post facto
ba-da-ba-da...
oh, oh...
