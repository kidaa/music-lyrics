Tune in rock star, theres no dark spot running around your face
you find time to get laid
you find ways to get paid
you dont see no busted rainclouds watering up your days
and so set in your ways
and so fixed in your gaze
youre calling out for more
youre breaking out in time
it sounds just like a war
and everybodys blind
youre digging out some more 
and now its time to fly
sleep? sound in the ghost town away
and you can just stay
a terrible way
hanging out there, areas of gray
got most of it motioned away
got a life to lead oceans away
Tune in rock star, theres no dark spot running around your face
you find time to get laid
you find ways to get paid
you dont see no busted rainclouds watering up your days
and so set in your ways
and so fixed in your gaze
