sitting out on your house
watching hardcore ufo's
drawing pictures, playing solos til ten
are you amplified to rock?
are you hoping for a contact?
i'll be with you, without you, again
turn and run, the angel's calling
you say when and i say i'm falling
up and down through broken down buildings
back and forth but please don't bother at all
count the days that we have wasted from the start
speak the words and build a playground
in your head
turn and run, the angel's calling
you say when and i say i'm falling
up and down through broken down buildings
back and forth but you know why i left you for so long
you know why i left you for so long...
