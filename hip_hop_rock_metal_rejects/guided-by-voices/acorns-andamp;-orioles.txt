over the summer 
somehow waiting 
sometimes craving 
and i gave it all away 
let my mind slip away 
kept everyone away
i can't tell you anything 
you don't already know 
i can't tell you anything 
you don't already know 
i can't tell you anything
i am the minister, and the imposter 
you said i'm on my own 
but i am not alone 
you are the militant 
fighting to bring me home
i can't tell you anything 
you don't already know 
i can't tell you anything 
you don't already know 
i can't tell you anything
i can't tell you anything
you don't already know...
