they just don't 
understand me
they never will
this-all we do
we do for you
shit gets old, and demanding
it never fails 
to amaze me when I see
it all before me
a power-freak
who self destructs
the ripe ol' man in monster trucks
and I am just a monkey boy 
in search of yet another toy
daylight breaks 
and I see your face
where were you then
somewhere off to yourself
too many people involved in the game
