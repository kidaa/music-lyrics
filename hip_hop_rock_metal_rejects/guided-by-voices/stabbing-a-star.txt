Well meet the maid, she's likable 
A tonic for the masses 
Rubbing her ferocious fur 
Like rockets through molasses 
Jump for joy, it's all the boy 
The only one we need 
Peaceful pet, he's all I get 
So now you see how people are 
Hey, look at me, I'm stabbing a star
Investigating innocence 
About the shallow manhole 
I get down methodically 
Without regard to my soul 
Raise my hand 
And speak the truth 
I'm starving for a fun fuck 
I don't believe how people are 
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star 
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star 
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star 
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star
