tower to the skies
an academy of lies
and what goes up
surely must come down
and we felt the mighty blow-up
with the walls coming down
or something like that
most of us are quite pleased
with the same old song
and all of a sudden i'm relatively sane
with everything to lose and nothing to gain
or something like that
man of wisdom and man of compromise
man of weak flesh in an armored disguise
all fall down
";if it's right you can tell"; echos myron like a siren
with endurance like the liberty bell
and he tells you of the dreamers
but he's cracked up like the road
and he'd like to lift us up, but we're a very heavy load
and we're finally here and shit yeah it's cool
and shouldn't it be - or something like that
