Shot down from the rafters and off to everafter
Consider this a failure, so be it--urchin promise
The curse is working--the trail of bodies
That leaves no suspect, what did you expect?
And get it, get it here, get it now
The news is not worthy
Don't even look
You're cornered into thinking
Invited to the lynching
Specify instructions
I'll shoot the arrow straight up
I'll frame your holy mugshot
Add insult to buckshot
And then I'll drink with glycerol frog-eye
Yeah, she can tell you every detail..
