On the tundra
We went under
We're going under now
On the tundra
We went to vicious places
Of dark and punished faces
Couldn't shake it
Or outgrow it
??Swung hells?? get open now
Don't we know it
Cause with my second guessing
The subject for the testing
Chorus:  Look over our blunders
Our two-fisted wonders
The foxy wildest monster dial is
More peaceful than a human hammer
The great ??king tam?? transmissionaries
Evolving without about you
Dissolving without you
As you know
It's just too slow on the tundra
And then one day
Maybe today
We'll justify the joke
Make it our day
And blow the total savings
To satisfy our cravings
Chorus
