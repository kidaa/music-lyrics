the lifeblood - the lighthouse flashing
16 chicks remain on watch
for the wheels to come rolling in
and they do...
yes they always do
i'd be bored and disappointed if they didn't
buzzards and dreadful crows
right on the tip of my nose
they wait like cats and fly out
for the light in my eyes to die out
and it does...
yes it always does
i'd be shocked and removed if it didn't
buzzards and dreadful crows
a necessary evil, i suppose
there's something in this deal for everyone
did you really think that you were the only one?
