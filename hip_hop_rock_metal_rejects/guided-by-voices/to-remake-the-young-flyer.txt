to remake the young flyer 
yes we must define his high desire 
standing erect and not detect the anything 
that we could not admire
from the long lonely pirate 
number one is that the one to send 
to restore on the child this
and then the national pride of crying
a question to the lunatic:
does your days seem like nights? 
do your world go together?
gotta mend, dash forth 
he takes his place 
he ends the laughter of the sayonara's 
takes his softness from his hand and goes
to remake the young flyer 
yes we must define his high desire
