She's got the face
She's got the face that makes me happy
I never thought about how lovely it was
Until one day she went over and out
Over and out
Over and out
When will she come back to me
Over and out
She's a disgrace
She's a disgrace to friends and family
I never thought about how lucky I was
Until one day she went over and out
Over and out
Over and out
When will she come back to me
Over and out
