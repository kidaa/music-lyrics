Long Live Rockathon
Offspring and Tag alongs were finding
The history book has lost its binding
pages everywhere
Two Titans without care will read them
We conjure ghosts and then we feed them
And if it all goes well we'll laugh a lot
and then we'll all take photographs
of what we made..lemonade
freedomcake quick to bake
trim the tree collectively
breath the air from the fair
and watch colored lights shine down
dancing round the lady's face
as we learned the sound
we can't? keep this violent pace
though we know that haste makes waste
and I'm giving you a ring
for the dreams of the weedking we all sing
