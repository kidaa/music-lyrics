It's too late now she's got me dreaming 
Without you there is no truth according to me 
Inside and around me tears got me drinking 
Without you there is no scope in the morning for me 
One of these days in the night 
Old enemies will come back to fight 
And since you would then disagree 
We will be skinned alive 
When full colored kings arrive 
And teach then we will all we know 
Bring popcorn for Geronimo 
And dance with our freshly made friends 
Ignoring the old ones - the boring and cold ones 
And when the colossus crawls west 
Jazz bastards will fall and confess 
We all love you so and 
You rock is paradise plastic 
It's cheap and fantastic!
