crowded gymnasiums
no shortage of knockouts 
and the country dance sellathon 
overworked spines 
all efforts considered
oooh, oooh
but not before the prizes, are posted 
the king size electric institute
he's proud to prevent 
dazzling rhine jive click 
and his up and coming bombadeers 
are fuckin right 
how they stacks in a million years
