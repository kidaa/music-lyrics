I dare not say
The way I feel
About your inability to
Suck it up and win the game
Chew me up and spit me out
It's been a long ugly winter
I need a sunbath
??Winning horse??
Of course I'm not complaining
I'm simply dying
Yes I'm waiting
Got a good love left
Good lord willing
Got a tractor to tow
The house on fantasy park
??The new corn belt??
In the new Bible belt
Take me to the pilot light
And sing me to sleep
