Firmly rooted and quite hellbent 
The old grunt packs up the hose 
And pokes his nose through the old trunk trap 
Hurts from years of concentration 
Spent in the umpires association 
Talking 'bout the next sensation 
Up and coming 
But now he's strumming 
A buzzing one-stringer 
Always quite a singer 
Did his wife in the dueling banjos.... 
Scarred but tougher
