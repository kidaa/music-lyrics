Reinvented nightly
Wake up with skills like this
And do you want me in your head?
But what's behind your scattered eyesigns?
I want to reinvent you now
Fifty hats and bargain suits
We will wear them if we must
But who will be a human boot?
Kick the wave of current hotlines?
I want to reinvent you now
Reinvent you nightly
Reinvite you rightly
I'll reunite you
