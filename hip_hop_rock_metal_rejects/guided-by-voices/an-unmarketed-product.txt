An unmarketed product
Is shining clear for many years
The time it takes you to put up
Shut out the fears for many years
How do these things
come in to our lives 
So obtrusively?
Why do they change 
their prices so accordingly?
Well, I can give you credit
Suitable and custom tailored
And if you have any luck
You'll get ahead
Before you're dead
