adrenaline, what did you find 
the fog of a nightmare dissipated 
i wrote a sign, to know that mind
the ghosts of a different dream are waiting
a different kind of kiss
the souls of a different mist are rolling 
i've been inside the mist
the ghosts of another fist are calling
the troops are led, internal red 
despite of the oldest trumpet blaring 
a world of hate can't penetrate 
the crest of the different shield your wearing 
a different kind of fight 
keep those telephones a-ringing 
i've been inside alright 
the ghosts of a different dream are singing
