cover your eyes 
the light is too bright 
your wise men, they tell you lies 
and what's worse, they curse 
but still, i love the bite 
but flies are maybe marked men 
cause they're attracted to the light 
they realize 
the night has come to baptize 
and they will finally realize 
and what's worse, it hurts 
but still, they love the bite
and i would like to die with you 
i'd like to try but i'm not suicide 
and i would like to kill you 
but that would suit you fine i realize 
and i will not disgrace myself 
by chasing you around to pull you back 
and i will not give in and hit you when 
before the fight begins and its okay 
i'm over you 
i'm over you 
i'm over you 
i'm over you 
cover your eyes 
the light is too bright
