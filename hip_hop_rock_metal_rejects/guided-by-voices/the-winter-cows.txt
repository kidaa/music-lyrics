So sing, so sing the winter cows 
They lowly croak and no-one wonders where they are 
Now they know 
Just what will come remains a mystery to me 
Now they know 
Just what will come remains a mystery to me 
To me 
Remains a mystery
And when they come into our view they disappear like a lonely star 
The winter cows are leaving now 
The summer sun is burning their eyes 
Their infant eyes 
Burning their eyes 
Their infant eyes 
Burning their eyes
