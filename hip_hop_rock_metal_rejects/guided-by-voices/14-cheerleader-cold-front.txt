14 cheerleader cold front
put your nose? beyond  
creeping boys in alleys 
find them when your gone?
stick close to locker rooms
and waving clothes to wear?
you will hold them dear
to something queer and stare?
16 used companions
have nowhere to stay
give them access to parking spaces 
no coin meters there
