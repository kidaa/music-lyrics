I was sittin' alone but not very long
She had a weakness for comin' on strong
She was lickin' my fingers and frinkin' my booze
She whispered sweet nothings, I said, "babe, is it true?"
You show me yours and I'll show you mine
Ordered a bottle, the finest French wine
I was headed for heaven, but she took the wheel
She took me to the cleaners -- you know how it feels?

Out all night, time to get started
Savin' all week for a bang boom party
Dollar for a drink, dollar for my honey
Burning a hole, gonna spend my girl money
Girl money

Long legged Rosie from Baltimore
Took me farther than I've been before
Oh she loved me for those diamonds and pearls
Took me for a ride -- took me around the world
What'dya say? Uh-huh
What'dya do? All night
Where'dya go? Gogogo-go-go
Yeah yeah

Out all night time to get started
Savin' all week for a bang boom party
Dollar for a drink, dollar for my honey
Burning a hole, gonna spend my girl money
Out all night time to get started
Savln' all week for a bang boom party
Dollar for a drink, dollar for my honey
Burning a hole, got to spend my girl money
Spend my girl money
Ah Girl Money
Yea yea yea Girl Money
C'mon baby Girl Money
Ah yeah Girl Money
Time to get started Girl Money
Burnin' a hole, gonna spend my girl money
