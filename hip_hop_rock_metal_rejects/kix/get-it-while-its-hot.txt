I'm a love machine
M-16
Shoot you full of holes
I'll scratch your back
Give you a heart attack
And drag you across the coals
I'm not fooling around
I'm gonna melt you down
You need to change your oil
A little gasoline in your canteen
Will bring you to a boil

Get it while it's hot
I'm on fire
Get it while it's hot
Don't be too cool get it while it's hot

If you let me in
I can blister your skin
burns of the third degree
Throw your coat on the floor
And lock the door
Shade the light from me

You're gonna have to run 
From my loaded gun
Get ready for the show
You knock me off my feet
When you turn up the heat
And the list begins to grow

Get it while it's hot
I'm on fire
Get it while it's hot
Don't be too cool get it while it's hot

Come and get it - While it's hot
Come and get it - Under rock
Come and get it - On the street
Come and get it - In the sheets

Flames in the gutter
Smoke in the sky
Hot undercover
But I gotta try

Get it while it's hot
I'm on fire
Get it while it's hot
Feed desire
Get it while it's hot
You're not gonna know
Get it while it's hot
Where the winds gonna blow
Get it while it's hot
I'm a love machine
Get it while it's hot
I'm an M-16
Get it while it's hot
