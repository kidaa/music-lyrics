Time - Keeps on crawling
Only game in town
But tonight
The streets are calling
And the fuse is burning down

Pump it up
Blow it down
She's got to give it all for free
She's out tonight
She's dynamite
Red lite green lite tnt

She's a snow white angel falling from the clouds
She has to water all the flowers in our town
Red lite green lite tnt

Strangers car
Superstar
She'll get right down on her knees
She gets her kicks
From dirty tricks
Red lite green lite tnt

She's the honey from the bottom of the jar
Mother may I say I've never come this far

I can feel the motion
taking over me
When I - Feel explosion
Like a blast of TNT  red lite green lite, tnt

Bombs away
Ya' pay to play
Satisfaction guarantee
She's out tonight
She's dynamite
Red lite green lite tnt
