Hey little sister whatcha need
I got what you're looking for
?
When you own the candy store
hey you wet behind the ears
No - There ain't no angels here
Better watch those dirty boys
Here they come
Better watch those dirty boys

Sticks and stones will break your bones
But I'm on a winning streak
Don't stop me now leave me alone
I like playin' in the street
We came here to make some noise
Hey - Better watch these dirty boys

My mama taught me pretty please
But I was daddy's little squirt
?
When he was laying in the dirt
Hey you wet behind the ears
No! - There ain't no angels here

Better watch those dirty boys
Here they come
Better watch those dirty boys
Give it to me
