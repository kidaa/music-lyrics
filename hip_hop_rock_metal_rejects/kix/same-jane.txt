Oh-uh uh uh
Out all night - nothin' to do
Runnin' wild out lookin' for you
Somebody tell me, whatever happened to Jane Jane Jane
Where's the bump and grind, the tease and sleeze
You turned around a hundred and eighty degrees
Tell me, tell me, I'm on my knees
Look me in the eye, uh uh - I said

Where where where's the same Jane?
