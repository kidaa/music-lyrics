Yeah
Standing in the dark
Closin' in, I think I'm going under
Fell down so fast
>From the words I heard a crash like thunder

Never thought I'd feel the final blow
Like a shot it turned my heart to stine, we were
Livin' in a dream, now it seems so far away

Why'd you tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
All the pieces were all in place
Why was it love you had to break

So restless I can't sleep
Where's the flame, the flame that burns forever, oh
Tore it all apart
I hope someday we can put it back together

I know ya' feel the tears inside
I don't wann have to say goodbye - oo
Why'd you tear down the walls
Watch 'em crumble and fall
All of the pieces were all in place
Why was it love you had to break

We were livin' in a dream
Now it seems so far away
Oo whoa whoa why'd you tear down the walls
Watch 'em crumble and fall
All of the pices were all in place
Why was it love you had to break, oh

Why'd ya tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
Why'd ya tear down the walls
Yeah
