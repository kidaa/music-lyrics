Here I Come
Lookout

I'm lightning
Flying high above her town
She got a tailspin
She knew that I was coming down
I had a radar
Saw a flash on my screen
Well I went too far
She turned around and wiped me clean
She dropped me the bomb
She dropped me the bomb
I've done nothing wrong
She dropped me the bomb

I was lonely
A five star volunteer
I got excited
When suddenly she disappeared
My gun was loaded
_______?
When she exploded
Hidden right behind my back
She dropped me the bomb
She dropped me the bomb
I've done nothing wrong
She dropped me the bomb

She's a flying angel
High in the clouds
She shot down all the boys in the crowd
Shot right down

_________?
Could never miss the things she's done
I surrendered
When I thought I had her on the run
She was a decoy
She led me right in
I was shell shocked
She left me falling in a spin

She dropped me the bomb
She dropped me the bomb
I've done nothing wrong
