To get your kicks -- you need a fix
And that is true
To get your love, you need a slug
Just like booze
You lick your lips, your backbone splits
You must get stoned
Don't take my head - don't take my heart
Leave me alone

You're a love - luv-a-holic
Girl - you must get stoned
You're a luv--holic - leave my heart alone
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

You're all strung out, your hair sticks out
Hear what I say
You need a lot - a double shot
Twice a day
And when you beg, right down my leg
Just one more drop
And then I say why can't
Why can't you ever stop?

You're a love - luv-a-holic
Girl - you must get stoned
You're a luv-a-holic
Leave my heart alone

You're a love - luv-a-holic
Girl - you must get stoned
You're a luv-a-holic - leave my heart alone
You're a love - luv-a-holic
Girl - you must get stoned
You're a luv-a-holic - leave my heart alone

She's a walkin' down my street now, baby
Here she comes
She's a lonely lonely reptile, baby
Here she comes
Give'er what she needs - give'er what she needs
She needs a love-love-love-love
She needs a love-love-love-love
She needs a love-a love-a love-a love love love love
la-la-la, luv-a-holic

Shake it
She needs love, luv-a-holic
