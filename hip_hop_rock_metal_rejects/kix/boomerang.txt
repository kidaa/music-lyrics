I turn and start to shake you baby
Still on my tippy toes
You know I should have left you baby
A long long time ago
I sat there on my doorstep baby
Crying in the rain
But oh the crazy dream
I watched my tears run down the drain

She's a boomerang
Keep comin' back to me
She's a boomerang
Keep comin' back to me

You know sometimes you're just so damned hard to please

If I give my heart away
Would it break these chains
If I cried a million tears
Would it drown the flame
You know you set my soul on fire
But there's nothing left to burn nothing left to burn
You're just a boomerang
Throw it out - watch it turn turn

Boom boom boom boomerang
She's a boomerang
Boom boom boom boomerang
She's a boomerang

Nothing will shock you baby
Stop - Look around
Well I was out with the boys last night
They said your babies back in town
