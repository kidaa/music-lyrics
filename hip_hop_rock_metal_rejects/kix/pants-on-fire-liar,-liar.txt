Caught you at the Midtown bar
Gettin' outa your daddy's car, ya said it wasn't true
Shakin' like a monkey snake
Couldn't even look me in the face
Baby baby baby when I was lookin' at you

Every little thing you try to tell me
Every dirty trick you try to pull
Every tie you stick the knife inside me
They got a name for you

Liar liar pants on fire - liar
They got a name for you
Liiar liar pants on fire - liar - liar - liar

You said I was your only man
But I saw where you put your hand
That ain't no way ta ta ta treat me right
Saw your little head go down
Word is all over town - town - 
Yeah - I caught you redheaded

Every little thing you try to tell me
Every dirty trick you try to pull
Every tie you stick the knife inside me
They got a name for you
Liar liar pants on fire - liar
They got a name for you
Liar liar pants on fire - liar - liar - liar

I bet you had' seein' stars
I know just how good you are
You always make me crazy crazy
Now you're lookin' in my eyes
Here comes another alibi - bye-bye b-baby

Every little thing you try to tell me
Every dirty trick you try to pull
Every tie you stick the knife inside me
They got a name for you
Liar liar pants on fire - liar
They got a name for you
Liiar liar pants on fire - liar - liar - liar
They got a name for you
Liiar liar pants on fire - liar - liar - liar
