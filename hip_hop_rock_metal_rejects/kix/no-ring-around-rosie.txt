Ahhhh, We all fall down

I know a girl that you know too
Everything you heard about her well it's all true
Under the bleachers out in the snow
A back street teacher in an all night show
Bad bad girl
She ain't too pretty she ain't too proud
A red hot devil in an angels cloud
Her finger tips got the magic touch
She'll shake her hips and make a blind man blush
Bad bad girl
No ring around Rosie
No halo over her hair
No ring around Rosie
Weak in the knees go around and round
They all fall down

Ring around Rosie
Ring around Rosie

When her daddy's at work 
And her mom ain't home
She ain't no angel you can hear her moan
She's so good when she's so bad
Best little girl I have ever had
Bad bad girl

No ring around Rosie Bad bad girl
No ring around Rosie Bad bad girl

They all fall down
All fall down
no ring around Rosie
No halo over her hair
No ring around Rosie
Weak in the knees go around and round and round
They all fall down
Bad bad girl
