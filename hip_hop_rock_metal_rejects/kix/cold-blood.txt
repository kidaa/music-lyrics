Cruisin' downtown
Shakin' her love
Is that babe talkin' to me
Felt my heart drop
Women can't stop
Girl has got me on my knees
Baby baby babe don't make me wonder
Won't you let me in
She said - see you later
Shot down
I'll be back again

Good love is all you need
Give me what I know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

Dresses so tight
Movin' to the beat
Set my feet on fire
Dream come true I'm gonna give it to you
Let the flame get higher
Baby baby you're drivin' me crazy
Like a cat in a cage
You make me shiver - earthquake
Down down to the grave

Good love is all you need
Give me what I know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

You make me so hot
I feel my temperature rise
Don't shoot me down - No
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed
Good love is all you need
Give me what I know
Cold blood is all you bleed
