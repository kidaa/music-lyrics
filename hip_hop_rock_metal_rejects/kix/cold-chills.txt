Oo well it's way past sundown
Hear the clock strike twelve
Feel the darkness fallin'
Oo, it's hot as hell
What's that shadow, who's that sound?
You're right in the wrong part of town, ya got

Cold chills runnin' down your spine
Cold chills - you think you've lost your mind
Is this just a walkin' nightmare
Will you wake up from this dream?
Cold chills - cold chills
You tried but you can't scream

Everone was leavin', but you stayed on your own
Thought they'd come and get ya
Now it's a long way home
You thought you heard 'em call your name
But there's no one there to blame

You hear footsteps in the silence
Your heart's poundin' - you're tremblin', shakin', no no no no

Is this just a walkin' nightmare
Will you wake up from this dream
If you break down you'll be sorry
As the vultures pick you clean

Cold chills runnin down your spine
Cold chills - you think you've lost your mind
Is this just a walkin' nightmare
Will you wake up from your dream
Cold chills, cold chills, cold chills
You got the
Cold chills, cold chills, cold chills
You gotta get away
Cold chills, cold chills, cold chills
They're walkin you home, you got the
Cold chills, cold chills, cold chills
You're left all alone
Cold chills, cold chills, cold chills
