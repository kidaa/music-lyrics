This is NOT a song about Bruce Lee or his sonThe sun feels good and George the fighter knows
he's the strongest man in Italy and Sicily Wining all the sicily man-fights
Tattoo-ed anywhere and all over
his eyes engraved deep down in his face he looks like a bird of prey
Living with his mother, an eagle and a tiger, a rat and an alligator,
sitting for days and his life to study his animals fighting.
Sometimes we can find him,
training or bouncing for a local club, while once he was guarding
for the president.
He was not very tall, but not very human and frightened the people off
The strongest man south of Rome has never been in love - except with his mother.
Suddenly and nearly 34, he meets the first girl in his life
and when she wakes him up the next morning
his mother sees a girl in his bed
pain is deep - she takes a knife and another
into his eye and the other waking up in agony
straight in the pool he jumps, to lose the last fight with an alligator
a true death and a proud mother.
will always remember him as a great hero.
