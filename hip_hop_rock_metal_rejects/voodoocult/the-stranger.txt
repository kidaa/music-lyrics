Lyrics by Phillip Boa. Main melody-line composed by Gabby Abularach

Happiness was in me still, the universe's benign indifference
opened my heart forever, it was better disappear than to burn
All I want is that life remembers me.
Good life was mine no longer

Light and heat made me dizzy the dark got me in the end
Fool tricks asking for trouble in my mind a free man lies on my thinking
my feelings influence my physical condition, the door of my undoing 
fatefully shoots like in a gangster - rap loud glare... not sad, just dream like.
A moment of violence enjoys everything in me
A hot day's fire makes me feel much better.
I suppose I loved her.
Every-thing in my life has changed, really
I was in great urge to touch a new mother. 
Could I turn a professed theist in the end?
Today sun and life killed me.
