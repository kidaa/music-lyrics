Let hope and trust feel down on you - and smile let time die hard no you - 
and simle!
How do I know if your simle is true? Your civil-mask lets nothing through.
This is the age of tasmanian smiles the return of the laughter-master.
What do you want? Is it despise?
Is THAT what you want? Then mind your head if you go ahead - 
I reply with a demon-smile
we better slap hands before I release my angry tribe
But maybe we can scorn together
find a way and fight our way to another wonderful day
who needs war in a world of wars?
Let time die hard on us - and smile!
It's a great honour that you put your trust in me!
And smile!
And if I feel obsession can I lean on you?
I feel you hard.
