With me  a scent of blood is posing like a devil, like my inner devil
I think I better close my eyes I feel like a gang of wolves
'Was a bastard yesterday 
Feel better today 
Never mind I never think about tomorrow's day...in a day'
I better close my eyes can not bear the truth: the gods are playing cricket
the sun's a cripple...I love life!
Excuse my dirty kind of spirit sarcasm is my fame! The flowers is my brain are growing in aspic
Kiss me, for another day, kiss me!
I dream it every night: being pushed into a deep black hole of nothing, 
while driving to the highway to hell...I feel me falling!
Until I wake up - in sweat - and I see how life can be quite nice!
I close my eyes...before I bleed to death
