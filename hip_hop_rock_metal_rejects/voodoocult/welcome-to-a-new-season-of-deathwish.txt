Composed by Gabby Abularach, lyrics by Phillip Boa

Welcome - to a new season of deathwish
and other dangers.
Come in - you won't feel surprised just a little but scared.
Forget that - you are too romantic
It's just your argus - eyes will stare, and open your mind for a while.
But don't worry - next sleep will come.
It might be long, it might be eternal.

There's only one philosophical problem: shall I wait until I suddenly die.
Or shall give it a suicidal try?
No poet has ever had the courage to prove and find out why...life is so strong...
life is so cruel.
It fucks you with a knife, day in, day out, so please go and answer the question.
Then don't look away - look up and welcome to a millennium of feeling young forever.

It's a fistful of hate, I associate, when I think about the future - stay young forever!
Welcome - to a new season of deathwish.
