We're going to dance,
We're going to dance,
We're going to dance
And have some fun
Fun fun fun
Dig!

The chills that you
Spill up my back
Keep me filled with
Satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I I couldn't ask for another
I-I-I-I-I I
No I couldn't ask for another
Oh that's right
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls only the bridge
My supperdish, my succotash wish
Sing it baby
I I couldn't ask for another
Uh-huh uh-huh
I-I-I-I-I I
No I couldn't ask for another

Ahah!

Groove is in the heart
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Groove is in the heart
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Groove is in the heart
Ask me mama
Groove is in the heart
Ah-ah-ah

Watch out!

The depth the hula groove
Move us to the nth hoop
We goin' through to Horten
Hears a who-ooh
I I couldn't ask for another
I-I-I-I-I I
No couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I I couldn't ask for another

Sing it

Groove is in the heart
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ne-na-na-na-na
Groove is in the heart
Ne-na-na-na-na
Groove is in the heart
