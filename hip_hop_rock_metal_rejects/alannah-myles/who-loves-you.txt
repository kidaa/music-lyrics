I send a message to you
I close my eyes
And hope it gets through
It's in the language of love
It's in your touch
There in your mouth
I wonder if you hear me tonight
Sometimes you're so far away
I wanna have you near me tonight
Do you belong to me?
CHORUS:
Who loves you?
Who you gonna run to
Who loves you? 
What you gonna do about it
Who loves you
Who you gonna run to
Who loves you 
What you gonna do about it now
so tired I can't fall asleep
I close my eyes and breathe in the heat
I've got this passion for you
Like inspiration
Out of the blue
I wonder if you hear me tonight
Sometimes you're so far away
I wanna have you near me tonight
Do you belong to me
Who loves you
Who you gonna run to
Who loves you 
What you gonna do about it 
I send a message to you
I close my eyes and hope it gets through
