Every man I meet is in a hurry
To find a new romance
Always wanna leave the party early
Maybe I'd like to dance
Slowly    if you really wanna know me
Take it easy when you hold me
I might let go
Play it cool straight and true look me in the eye
If you want to
Talk to me
Take your time don't be shy
Tell me your name
If you want to
Walk with me
I'm the kind who  waits for someone special
Instead of fallin' to fast
I believe the night is something precious
That's why I want it to last
slowly ..  if you really wanna know me
Take it easy when you hold me
Don't let me go
Play it cool straight and true look me in the eye
If you want to
Talk to me
Take your time don't be shy
Tell me your name
If you want to
Walk with me
What are we gonna do
You look like somethin'  new

And I like the way you move
Don't let me go
Play it cool straight and true look me in the eye
If you want to
Talk to me
Take your time don't be shy
Tell me your name
If you want to
Walk with me
Little by little I'll let you know 
If I want you to get close to me
