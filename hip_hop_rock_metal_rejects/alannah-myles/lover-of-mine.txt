Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Will it ever become what I've always wanted it to?
You tell me, I'm the lucky one.
How can you say that?
When it breaks my heart to see another woman with you.

Oh, lover of mine.
Oh, lover of mine.

When it hurts so bad
I wanna hold you in my arms.
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine.

After we've said all there's to say,
Am I still in your heart or am I just in your way?
My desire for you is running wild,
Jealousy, dangerous kind,
When I see you looking
At another woman that way.

Oh, lover of mine.
Oh, lover of mine.

When it hurts so bad
I wanna hold you in my arms.
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine.

Please set me free and give me your reason.
I try to keep it alive.
There is no need for us to be lonely.
Give me some kind of hope,
I'm walking and wind on.

Oh, lover of mine.
Oh, lover of mine.

When it hurts so bad
I wanna hold you in my arms.
Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine.

Make me feel like you wanna be a lover of mine.
