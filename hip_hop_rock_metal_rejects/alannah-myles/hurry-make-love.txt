Don't leave me at home to long
Don't le me fall asleep unsung
Don't stay up with your damn TV
somebody else might make love to me

Hurry .... Hurry
Hurry make love to me

Don't believe in lyin' low
don't watch all that tall grass grow
I don't believe in darnin' socks
I just believe in love talks
CHORUS:
Hurry .... Hurry
Hurry make love to me
Hurry ....Hurry
Hurry make love to me
Hurry ...Hurry
Hurry make love to me
