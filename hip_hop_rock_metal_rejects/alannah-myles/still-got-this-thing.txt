Why is it so hard to say what's on my mind
Why am I so proud?
Still got this thing for you
I know you understand, but you still need a sign
Real love should shout out loud
Still got this thing for you
Hey baby can I carry your flame?
I wanna take you somewhere untame
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane?
Still got this thing for you
When you walk that way, I can feel the heat
Just below the surface
I'd do anything for you .. uh huh yeah
When you're out all alone, I hear things from the street
I get kinda nervous
Still got this thing for you. Oh yea
Hey baby can I carry your flame?
I wanna take you somewhere untame
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane?
Still got this thing for you
Let me see you smile, come on look me in the eye
To many times I let the chances go by
Pull down the shade, turn out the light
Help me make up for all those nights tonight
Real love, know it's true
Still got this thing for you
Real love, know it's true
Still got this thing for you
Hey baby can I carry your flame?
I wanna take you somewhere untame
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane?
We can't connect.. oh, that would be a shame
Hey baby can I carry your flame?
I wanna take you somewhere untamed
Don't you know you're drivin' me insane?
Still got this thing for you
Still got this thing for you
Still got this thing for you
