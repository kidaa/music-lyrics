He was  Johnny on the spot he was red hot
Walked slow and smoked a lot
She was a jukebox junkie, hand on  one hip
Great big eyes and bright red lips
I  said hey   hey hey hey
well they Eased on out to the center of the floor
Started dancing like never before
She's spinnin  like crazy, crashin' into the crowd
on top of two tables,  screamin' right out loud
I wanna rock this joint
I wanna take this town
Cause I light up when the sun goes down
I wanna rock this joint
I wanna take this place
Cause I wanna die with a smile on my face
I said hey.. hey hey hey
well The whole damn place
Spilled into the street
Climbin' on  cars
High on the heat
up on the roof
Johnny jived with his date           
Cops came by,  it was far too late
I said hey...
When Johnny came to .. his head was a mess
Woke up dreamin'  'bout a  skin-tight dress
found a message at the end of his bed
With the words he can't get right out of his head
I wanna rock this joint
I wanna take this town
I wanna rock this joint
I wanna shake this place
Cause I light up when the sun goes down
Cause I wanna die with a smile on my face
I said hey hey hey hey
