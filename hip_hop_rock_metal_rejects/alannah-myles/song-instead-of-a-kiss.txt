Song instead of a kiss
Baby this is a song instead of a kiss
For all of you who ache, who long for nights like this

Song instead of a touch
Darlin' this is a song instead of a touch
To all of you who wait so long and need so much


It is for those who like to cling
It is to those, those I sing
Here is a song instead of a clutch, instead of a moon
Instead of a soothing touch in the afternoon

It is for those who like to cling
It is to those, those I sing
Here is a song instead of a clutch, instead of a moon
Instead of a soothing touch in the afternoon
