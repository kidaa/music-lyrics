I've heard there's always one that's got to get away
Let him go even though  it's not that easy
I never listen to what the people say
I lose control
I let desire lead me
My conscience aches, but it's gonna lose the fight
I don't care, I'd give it all away tonight
For just one kiss
For just one kiss
For just one kiss
For just one
Of these fantasies I've kept inside till now
Lead me on
I will follow gladly
Please don't be mad at me because I let it show
Is it so wrong to want you so badly
You got the power that I know I can't resist
My heart is pounding and I'm bound to take the risk
For just one kiss
For just one kiss
For just one kiss
What if we lose tonight?
We'll never know
Should we give love a try or let it go?
I can't help what I do
The closer and closer I get to you
My conscience  aches, but it's gonna lose the fight
I don't care I'll give it all away tonight
For just one kiss
For just one kiss
For just one kiss
