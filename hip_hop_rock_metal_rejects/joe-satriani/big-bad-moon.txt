When the night falls, the big moon's gonna rise.
You can look right up, see it in the sky.
Makes me feel like I'm going to blow a fuse.
I start to shiver and shake with a strange kind of blues.
...But I like it.
I see it now the moon is high above.
It's got a hold on me, I just can't get enough.
Big, round, black and white, I feel the pull, I see the light.
Big bad moon's looking down on me tonight.
...But I like it.
When the moon comes, got nowhere to hide.
It can turn your head around like it turns the tide.
Man, woman, boy, child. Makes you feel like you were born wild.
The big bad moon's looking down on me tonight.
...But I like it.
...I like it.
Talkin' 'bout big bad moon
Ooh yeah big bad moon
Talkin' 'bout big bad moon
Ooh yeah...
