On the highway to your house,
I see the signpost, I check it out.
Can't slow down now to where you are.
I feel like I'm flying here, in my car.
I just can't slow down,
Driving to the sound.
Tear the walls down, tear them down.
Feel the power, it's all around.
I just can't slow down
Driving to the sound.
Never touch the ground,
I just can't slow down.
Something's burning deep inside.
My blood's on fire, my eyes are wild.
I'm in my own world, I'm inside out.
Looking for something, tell me what it's all about.
I just can't slow down
Driving to the sound
Never touch the ground,
I just can't slow down.
