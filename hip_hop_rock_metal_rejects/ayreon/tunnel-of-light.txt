Be joyful, my friends! You will now enter the Tunnel of Light. Let brilliance suffuse your
souls! Make your choice. Your path is incandescend.

don't offer me the light, when I only know the darkness
thats where I want to hide
there's a chill in my bones, that I recognise from another life
that's why I'm heading home

[egyptian] ra - heliopolis, ka - anenti
[roman] into Elysium!
[knight]  the isle of Avalon!
[egyptian] in the tunnel of light

[highlander]
don't tempt my heart with hope, in the shadows of broken promises
I guard my dreams
in the bend of a swollen river, in the roots of weeping willows I choose to lie

[egyptian] ra - heliopolis, ka - anenti
[roman] into Elysium!
[knight] the isle of Avalon!
[indian] the legend has begun!
[futureman] our one and only sun!   
[egyptian] in the tunnel of light

[egyptian] ra - heliopolis
[highlander] I rest my broken heart, where the willows weep
[egyptian] ka - anenti
[roman] into Elysium
[knight] the isle of Avalon!
[indian] the legend has begun
[egyptian] in the tunnel of light

[highlander]
I will lay me down
I will rest my head
I will close my eyes
