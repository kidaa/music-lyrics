I overheard the elders telling each Other stories about the days when They were young back on
planet earth
I wish to learn the secrets of those Who lived before me so I program my Computer for a flight
to planet earth
Blue skies over the oceans sail on the Wind to the valley below rise high over The hills to
where the wildflowers grow

And I ride ride ride the waves of time Fly fly fly beyond the sky
We've abandoned all emotions Whether good or bad up here in this Station far from planet earth
I can't tell if I'm happy I don't know if I'm sad but I do know I'd have been at Home back on
planet earth
Black clouds over the debris storm is Raging over the land no life left on this Planet now you
will understand

And I ride ride ride the waves of time Fly fly fly beyond the sky
Blue skies over the oceans sail on the Wind to the valley below rise high over The hills to
where the wildflowers grow
