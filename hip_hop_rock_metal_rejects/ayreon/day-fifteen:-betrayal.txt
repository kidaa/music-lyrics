[Fear] This is what you dreamt about 
Director of the firm 
Will it be you, or your best friend? 
He's always been the better man and 
He fits all their terms 
What will you do to gain your end... 

[Agony] You remember he once told you 
He tampered with the books 
When he lost out on the deal 
You're digging up the evidence 
...no one looks 
You leave it there for all to see 

[Reason] This memory burns inside 
You can't forget, you cannot fight or erase it 
[Passion] Let it go, try to unwind 
[Reason] You'll have to tell and set it right 
You cannot run, you cannot hide, so face it! 
[Passion] Wake up, free your mind 

[Fear] You never talk, he'll never know 
What you have done 
But can you live with this betrayal? 

[Agony] They found him out and let him go 
I guess you've won 
But one day, the truth might be unveiled 

[Reason] This memory burns inside 
You can't forget, you cannot fight or erase it 
[Passion] Let it go, try to unwind 
[Reason] You'll have to tell and set it right 
You cannot run, you cannot hide, so face it! 
[Passion] Wake up, free your mind 

[Reason] This memory burns inside 
You can't forget, you cannot fight or erase it 
[Passion] Let it go, try to unwind 
[Reason] You'll have to tell and set it right 
You cannot run, you cannot hide, so face it! 
[Passion] Wake up, free your mind 

[Me] I have to talk and let him know 
What I have done 
I cannot live with this betrayal 
He's always been the better man 
I never won 
Now the truth must be unveiled
