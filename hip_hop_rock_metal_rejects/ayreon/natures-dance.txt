AYREON RETIRES IN THE GARDEN OF DREAMS SURROUNDING CAMELOT,
ENJOYS THE WONDERS OF NATURE AND REFLECTS ON HIS FATE.
HE NOW FULLY UNDERSTANDS, AND RELUCTANTLY SUBMITS TO HIS DESTINY.

[Ayreon:]
I can smell the grass
And touch the flowers
Among the trees
I pass the hours
And fantasize
I let the dance of nature inspire me
Now my mind is free
From apparitions
I switch off like a 'television'
And close my eyes

And I wish that I could see
Like everybody can
How I wish that I could be
Like any other man

I can't see the sun
But I sense its glow
I hear the sound of water flowing down the stream
And my heart cries out for a little bit love
But I know that it was not meant to be
So I'll fulfil my destiny and accept my fate

Still I wish that I could see
Like everybody can
How I wish that I could be
Like any other man

THE TIME HAS COME FOR AYREON TO SET ABOUT HIS MISSION.
HE SINGS ABOUT THREE MAIN CAUSES OF THE EARTH'S EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION.
