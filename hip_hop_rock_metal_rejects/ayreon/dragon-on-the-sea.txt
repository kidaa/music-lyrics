"It is the 16th century. I am Queen Elizabeth sending out the brave Sir Francis Drake to
defend the English realm against the invading armada."

[Lana Lane]

Times are dark now, our empire's gone astray
Forces from down south, armada on the way
So we call our greatest men to run the barricade
Shine your light where shadows fall and wash the night away

Sail on for your queen
Sail into history
You will never be the same
Sail on for country
Into our memory
Time will remember your name
Dragon on the sea

Fires burn now in once our tranquil bays
Tall ships that rain down thunderbolts and flames
Go and raise your pirate flag, cast the lines away
Take your fleet where darkness falls and turn the night to day

The sun never sets on the empire won
But wise men say never say never
It slips through our hands just like sand in sun
We thought it would go on forever

Dragon ships they keep on sailing, on to Nova Albion
While the waking world is sleeping, dragon ships are sailing on
