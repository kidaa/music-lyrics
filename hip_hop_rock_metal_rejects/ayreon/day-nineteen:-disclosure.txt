[Best Friend] My good friend, I hope you hear my voice 
I must alleviate this ache 
I thought about this and found I have no choice 
I have to tell you this for conscience sake 

I felt alone, forsaken and afraid 
Out of work and out of love 
I needed someone to ease some of the pain 
She was there for me when times were rough 

[Wife] My sweet love, my heart belongs to you 
But I was lonely and the need for passion grew 
You where never here, and even when you were 
Most of my words would go unheard 
[Best Friend] I'd be there to comfort her 
[Wife] We'd shared our distress 
[Best Friend] But we were never in love 
[Wife] Can you forgive us? 

[Best Friend] My good friend, well maybe I am wrong 
I think you saw us on that day 
I want you to know, she loved you all along 
I hope that this will help you in some way 

[Wife] My sweet love, my heart belongs to you 
But I was lonely and the need for passion grew 
You where never here, and even when you were 
Most of my words would go unheard 
[Best Friend] I'd be there to comfort her 
[Wife] We'd shared our distress 
[Best Friend] But we were never in love 
[Wife] Can you forgive us? 

[Love] Don't be afraid, her heart belongs to you 
[Passion] Don't be afraid, don't keep her waiting 
[Love] It's time to rise, and tell them what you feel 
[Passion] You have to let them know 
[Love] Here the dream ends, this is real 

[Me] I'll be there to comfort her 
[Passion] I know you will be! 
[Me] I'll come back to life 
[Love] I know that you can!
