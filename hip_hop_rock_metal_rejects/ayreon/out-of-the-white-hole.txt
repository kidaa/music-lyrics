We come out of the white hole into the M31 galaxy, which is also known as Andromeda.
We see a planet that looks much like Earth.
Could it sustain life?
And if, who lives there?
[Timo Kotipelto]

[A. M31]

And out of nowhere we materialize
From a blaze of fire to a world of ice
We folded space to a distant sun
Inside the heart of M31

On a steady course to the planet Y
Circling round a star in Sirrah's eye
The search for life has now begun
In the constellation M31

Light years away, beyond our Galaxy
I see a planet like our own
A golden sun is shining down on me
Could it be that we are not alone?

We're passing Sirrah in the Alpha Pegasi
Into the atmosphere of planet Y
What will we find? Chances almost none..
Will there be life in M31?

Light years away, beyond our Galaxy
I see a planet like our own
A golden sun is shining down on me
Could it be that we are not alone?

[B. Planet Y]

We're diving through the nebulae and arrive on planet Y
A hundred thousand hollow eyes are gazing at the sky

There seems to be no motion, no pleasure and no pain
No symptoms of emotion, no loss and no gain

Solar screens and cold machines are covering up the ground
Crystal covered fields of green and oceans underground

Countless different entities but they all look the same
But then one of the entities is crying out its name:

Forever...
Remember Forever...

[C. The Search Continues]

It's time to leave and carry out our quest
Miles to go and things to see before we rest
We came in vain, our search is not yet done
For there's some kind of life in M31!

Light years away, beyond our Galaxy
I see a planet like our own
A golden sun is shining down on me
Could it be that we are not alone?
