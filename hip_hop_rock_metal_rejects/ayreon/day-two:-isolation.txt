[Me] I can't move, I can't feel my body 
I don't remember anything 
What place is this...how did I get here? 
I don't understand, what's happening... 

Am I alone? 

[Fear] You've been deserted, everyone has left you 
You know it's always been that way 
Those frantic years, the people you've neglected 
Now the time has come to pay 

You're alone 
No one here is dancing to your tune 

[Me] Is this a dream or is it real? 
[Reason] Sometimes the dream becomes reality 
[Me] But I don't know what to feel 
[Reason] Then I will guide you through this haze 
[Me] But who are you, why are you here? 
[Reason] I am you and you are all of us 
[Me] I can't think, my mind ain't clear 
[Reason] Then I will free you from this maze 

[Passion] Can't you feel it burn 
Deep down inside? 
Won't you ever learn 
Don't try to hide 

Can't you feel that fire? 
Scorching you soul? 
A wounded man's desire 
Out of control 

[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up 
That's not your way 
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay 

You always had complete control 
Never thinking twice 
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice 

[Me] You are delusions of my mind 
[Reason] And so we are, we're all a part of you 
[Me] Am I a part of some design? 
[Reason] The one design is in your head 
[Me] How can it be you look so real... 
[Reason] We are as real as you imagine us 
[Me] I can touch you, I can feel... 
[Reason] Then take my hand and follow me 

[Passion] Can't you feel it burn 
Deep down inside? 
Won't you ever learn 
Don't try to hide 

Can't you feel that fire? 
Scorching you soul? 
A wounded man's desire 
Out of control  

[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up 
That's not your way 
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay 

You always had complete control 
Never thinking twice 
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice  

[Love] Close your eyes, listen to your heart beat 
Surrender to its soothing pulse 
Silence the cries, gentle and carefree 
Good or bad, true or false... 

You're not alone 

You'll find me here whenever they oppose you 
I am the strongest of them all 
No need to fear these feelings that enclose you 
I'm here to catch you when you fall 

You're not alone 
I am here dancing to your tune 

[Passion] Can't you feel it burn 
Deep down inside? 
Won't you ever learn 
Don't try to hide 

Can't you feel that fire? 
Scorching you soul? 
A wounded man's desire 
Out of control  

[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up 
That's not your way 
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay 

You always had complete control 
Never thinking twice 
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice
