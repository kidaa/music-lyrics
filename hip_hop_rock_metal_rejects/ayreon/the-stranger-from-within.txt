He's a stranger I don't know Where he's coming from
Is he a danger to me or just Another man
He knows magic or maybe He's a charlatan
Is it a sly trick he plays does He have a plan

He said he came from a World beyond my dreams
From the depths of my mind
He said he'd burn like star And disappear
But leave his spirit behind

He's a stranger a man with a Destiny
A rearranger of fate a Changer of lives
They will erase him for they Are all afraid of him
They're gonna trace him and Then cause him to die

He said he'd cure me I do Not have to die
I hold my fate in my hands
He said he'd always be there Everytime I'd cry
One day I would understand

He was a stranger they shot Him and now he's dead
I'm out of danger he lives on Inside my head

He said he came from a World beyond my dreams
From the depths of my mind
He said he'd burn like star And disappear
But leave his spirit behind

He said he'd cure me I do Not have to die
I hold my fate in my hands
He said he'd always be there Everytime I'd cry
One day I would understand
