"It is the 17th century. I am a noble ensign-bearer posing with my guild for the Dutch
master painter, Rembrandt van Rijn, in Amsterdam."

[Mouse, Lana Lane]

I'm standing proud
In this noble crowd
My banner raised high the coat of arms of Amsterdam
To the mystic sky a magic light enchants the land

We're marching on
The shooting company of Captain Frans B. Cocq

My uniform shines the livery of a high-born man
The Claw-guild signs immortalized by the master's hand
Light and shade with colors rich and brushwork bold
Night and day with shadows black and amours gold

We're marching on
The shooting company of Captain Frans B. Cocq

I'm standing proud
In this noble crowd
In our golden age eternalized by the artist's hand
A glorious page in the history of our tiny land

We're marching on
Up to the battlefield to where the spirits walk
The shooting company of Captain Frans B. Cocq
