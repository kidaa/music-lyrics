[Hippie]
Hey dude, you're so uncool
But hey, that's alright
Like there's no need to get uptight
My eyes reflect the stars
And a smile lights up my face
We're on an amazing flight in space

It's kinda groovy in this world of fantasy
Where no one else can go
Within these boundaries I'm shielded from reality
Without a care or woe

[Egyptian]
Amon-ra, have you come to seal my fate?
In the garden of emotions
Free my ka, how much longer must I wait?
In the garden of emotions

[Hippie]
I roam the universe in cosmic meditation
To find my inner me
I'm getting high on love and spiritual vibrations
To set bad karma free

[Egyptian]
Amon-ra, have you come to seal my fate?
In the garden of emotions
Free my ka, how much longer must I wait?
In the garden of emotions

[Hippie]
Mirror mirror I can see a lonely child, he kinda looks like me
Staring out into infinity
His father lies, his mother cries, his spirit flies up in the skies
Wandering off to another galaxy

[Futureman]
Secret fears we all try to hide
Lie dormant deep inside us
Defy the ghosts of long forgotten days
Here inside the mirror maze

[Hippie]
Mirror mirror I can see an angry boy, oh well I guess he's me
Rising up to the society
He's aware that no one cares and life's unfair so he grows his hair
And takes a trip into eternity

[Futureman]
Secret fears we all try to hide
Lie dormant deep inside us
Defy the ghosts of long forgotten days
Here inside the mirror maze
