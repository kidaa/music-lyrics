Ah, my friends! So light of foot. So swift. You have come this far. And now - here beneath the
ancient, omniscient boughs of the Decision Tree - one of you must depart this world of flesh.
Only seven may continue. Only you can decide...

[barbarian]
let it be known I won't be the one to die here
honour and glory are heaped upon my name
let it be clear I'm not the one who cries here
what about the tall one, the one who's lost to shame

[highlander]
I've followed princes, I've raised their bloody banners
I've killed and wounded on the side of right
I've reaped the harvest, scattered fields with ashes
I've buried children, sowed the seeds of hate

[all chorus:]
we're alive
we'll survive
we will strike for
our freedom
we're alive
we'll survive
we'll arrive in our
eden

[highlander]
I've followed princes
I've followed kings
I will take their lead no
more
I will not lie
in shallow graves
I'm nobody's slave

[barbarian]
let it be known, by Thor the god of lightning
I have been chosen to do battle at his side
let it be clear I was born to go down fighting
what about the craven, the one who's lost his pride

[highlander]
don't speak to me of homour, pride and glory
I've tasted blood, seen your type before
you talk of battle but all you tell are stories
you'd see me buried in a shallow grave

[all chorus, highlander]
