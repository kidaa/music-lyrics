[A. I SOAR ON THE BREEZE]

[indian]
spirits-flying
I soar on the breeze
mortals-dying
I soar on the breeze
into the sun

lovers-crying
I soar on the breeze
demons-sighing
I soar on the breeze
into the sun

I'm drawn towards the sun
and then we will be one
my soul will melt into the universe

[futureman] It's all a lie
[roman] you will just die
[futureman] so don't give in
[roman] for we can win

[B. DEATH'S GRUNT]

[death]
I am the breeze
the bringer of rest and ease
I am the wind
the forgiver of those who've sinned
I am the storm
I blow the devil's horn
I am the fire
the source of lust and desire
I am the sun
the joining has begun
I am your fate
the guardian at the gate
I am death and I claim your final breath!

[C. THE PASSING OF AN EAGLE]
