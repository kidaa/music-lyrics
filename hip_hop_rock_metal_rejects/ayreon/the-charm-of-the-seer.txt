AYREON UNDERSTANDS THAT HE WAS NOT INDIVIDUALLY CHOSEN
FOR THE 'TIME TELEPATHY EXPERIMENT',
BUT THAT HE UNINTENTIONALLY RECEIVED ITS TRANSMISSIONS.
THIS COULD BE BECAUSE OF A MORE DEVELOPED SIXTH SENSE
AS A RESULT OF HIS BLINDNESS.
HE ALSO REALISES THAT HE CAN NEITHER ACCOMPLISH HIS MISSION,
NOR STOP THE VISIONS FROM PENETRATING HIS MIND.
HIS SOLE ESCAPE IS TO SUBMIT TO THE MAGIC CHARM OF THE GREAT SEER MERLIN.

[AYREON:]
I've been lost in the valley of nightmares
I've been found in the garden of dreams
speak thy charm, I know you are out there
cast thy spell and silence the screams

but as I poise on the edge of life
where time disappears
I bow in fear
to the charm of the seer

I've seen fear in valiant faces
I've seen hope in desperate eyes
lead me home to familiar places
lead me back to crystalline skies

and as I poise on the edge of life
where time disappears
I bow in fear
to the charm of the seer

I have failed, I have been forsaken
I've been scorned and misunderstood
I have lost, my life has been taken
I'd surrender if only I could
