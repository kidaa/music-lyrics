a new horizon
hear the travellers call
behold there lies a kingdom
go forth ye minstrel tall

sing of your wisdom
spread tidings of joy
a feast of song and laughter
ye courtyard minstrel boy

o'dance thee 'round the table
for conquerors and kings
thou muist win the heart of Gwenhwyfar
fair maiden of the king

thy lord thy master
Arthur thee so bold
heed the words of Ayreon
and thy future will unfold

sing ye tales of wonder
whilst ye hide behind the joy
cast thy spell asunder
ye courtyard minstrel boy

sing ye, oh sing ye, courtyard minstrel boy

a day of splendour
how beautiful birds sing
ladies, lords and masters
and rainbows he would bring

a child's sadness
sweet dreams, oh princely boy
let thyn eyes reveal the madness
ye courtyard minstrel boy
