"I join the Migrator on its long journey through time and space in search of the planet
Earth. On my journey I encounter many fantastic astronomical phenomena."

[Ralf Scheepers]

Fly me across the sky
Fly me to the edges of space
Show me the wond'rous sensations
And mysteries of aeons gone by

Guide me through a maze of stars
Guide me to the birth of my race
Give me the answers to questions
Reveal to me secrets of life

Journey on the waves of time

Lead me through the centuries
Lead me to places unknown
Sail me away on the x-rays
Of quasars that died long-ago

Carry me through the universe
Carry me back to my home
In search of the gateway
That leads us into the black hole

Journey on the waves of time

Our quest for life has now begun
The die is cast
Our voyage leads us to the sun
Out of the past
