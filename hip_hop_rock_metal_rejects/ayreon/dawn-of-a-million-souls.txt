"The Big Bang has created one soul, the Universal Migrator. The Universal Migrator
divides itself, and each Migrator flies off independently in search of a habitable planet
in order to breathe life into it. I follow the migrator that will eventually reach our
planet Earth."

[Russel Allen, Damian Wilson]

At the birth of time, the beginning of beginnings
One cosmic soul was created
A bringer of life, a universal migrator
Born to sow its seeds in all the galaxies

Like a cell dividing, it spreads in all directions
Creating life among the stars
I'm struck with awe as I join the great migrator
Now it takes flight to the brightest star of all

On a quest for life, through the sable skies
What a show! behold!
The dawn of a million souls

On a bold crusade, in the realm of shade
What a show! behold!
The dawn of a million souls

Through the glowing mist, like a fog of radiation
I can see the forming of new planets
I've been struck by thunder as I witness all the splendor
And I realize how small we really are

Ooh, I can see forever
On the wings of dreams I fly
Is this real or is it just a fantasy?
What awaits me now at the end of this ride?
