"We are on our way to the quasar, an object as bright as a galaxy. Our hope is that the
quasar may contain an unfathomable source of power and peril at its center ... a black
hole."

"On our journey, we receive the radio emissions of a pulsar -- an imploded neutron star."

[A. THE TAURUS PULSAR]

Within a distant nebula in the Taurus zodiac
I hear the wailing of a star, the weak pulse of a fading sun

All its fuel is burning out and its light will fade to black
I can't ignore its hopeless shout as it fires its death cry out in space

A star in Taurus lights up and outshines the galaxy
A fleeting moment of glory in time and space
A supernova resounds, a desperate symphony
Leaving behind a beacon fallen from grace

Lift your head up to the sky
And hear the faraway cry of a dying star

I heard its message from afar
A frequent surge of sight and sound
We approach the fallen neutron star
Spinning round and round and round

We attend this cosmic mass and we hear its sad lament
But even stars and planets pass in this cold and everlasting place

Lift your head up to the sky and hear the cry...

"We have encountered a quasar in the constellation Virgo. But does it really contain a
black hole, the portal to our final destination?"

[B. QUASAR 3C273]

[Andi Deris, Lana Lane]

Heading off into the core of a newborn galaxy
We have reached a brilliant star-like source of energy
This cosmic spectacle of radiance was formed
Fifteen billion years ago when the universe was born

To the quasar
Beyond the milky way
The redshift is high, a bright light in the sky

To the dark star
Beyond the light of day
The gravity's high, a black sun in the sky
3C273

As we approach the sea of light I'm forced to close my eyes
I can feel the vibrant waves of centuries go by
Then the pull of an unseen force is tearing us away
Could it be we found the entrance to our passageway?
