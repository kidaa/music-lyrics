[A. Eyes Of Time]

IT SLOWLY DAWNS ON AYREON THAT THESE VISIONS HE IS EXPERIENCING
ARE VISIONS OF THE FUTURE BUT HE DOES NOT FULLY COMPREHEND
THEIR IMPORTANCE YET.

[Ayreon:]
I cannot see with these eyes
My world is dark
Like a cold eternal night

I could not tell you no lies
My words are lost
In a shroud of mystery

[Villagers:]
Tell me what you see
[Ayreon:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time
[Villagers:]
Tell me what you feel
[Ayreon:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind
From the eyes of time

I do not know where I am
I'm lost in time
Drifting in eternity

I cannot tell if it's real
Or fantasy
Or a view of things to come

[Villagers:]
Tell me what you see
[Ayreon:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time
[Villagers:]
Tell me what you feel
[Ayreon:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind
From the eyes of time

I'm still trying to understand
Why do I see the things I see
Could it be a future world
That's warning us through me
I'm still trying to understand
Why do I know the things I know
Does it mean I'm a god
Will nobody tell me so?

[Villagers:]
Tell me what you see
[Ayreon:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time
[Villagers:]
Tell me what you feel
[Ayreon:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind
From the eyes of time

[B. Brainwaves]

IT ALL GETS TOO CONFUSING FOR AYREON AND THE THIN LINE BETWEEN
ILLUSION AND REALITY FADES.
