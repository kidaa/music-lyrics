A black shadow is crawling like a Deadly spider we're all waiting in Silence for the lonely
rider fore he will Lead the way for he will save the town We have to leave today before the Moon
is down

I'm haunted by dreams of a holy Mission I follow the signs of my magic Vision
We have to dig a hole and he will be Our eyes we have to reach a goal Before the sun will rise

Journey to the farside of the world no One will catch me when I fall follow the Trail of fire
no one will hear me when I Call journey to the farside of the world A distant place a future
time we'll Climb the tallest spire I will raise the Cross and the bells will chime

We'll pass over the river to the silver Tower run before the clock strikes the Final hour
He saw it in a dream he knew he had To die we never heard him scream we Never heard him cry
Journey to the farside of the world Make them believe the dream is true Follow the trail of
fire the moon came Down my time is through journey to The farside of the world this is the way
It was meant to be we'll climb the Tallest spire the shadow is gone the Town is free
