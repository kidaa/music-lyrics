In a dusty room on a stormy night Away from all the crowds I rise above The clouds
Into a world once so bright where now The shadows fall and a thousand Voices call
Dream on forevermore our future's in Your hands close your eyes close Your eyes and fantasise
Only one boy whose heart is pure can Save them from the curse that's upon This universe
He's on a quest for the secret cure Across the burning sand to the edge Of the fairy-land

Dream on forevermore our future's in Your hands close your eyes close Your eyes and fantasise
This world was built upon human Dreams on hopes instead of fears now It slowly disappears
Scream as loud as you can scream For the empress needs a name or Nothing will remain

Dream on forevermore our future's in Your hands close your eyes close Your eyes and fantasise

Dream on forevermore ....
