We have reached our first destination: the black hole in the Virgo cluster of galaxies.
But what will we find inside? Its power is immeasurable.
Our hopes and fears intermingle as we stand at the event horizon.
Will its doorway transport us to our faraway planet Earth, or will its fury mercilessly tear us apart?
[Bruce Dickinson, Lana Lane]

[A. The Eye Of The Universe]

A dark sphere surrounds us
Surreal... oblivious...
In the centre of the galaxy
A hidden force has found us
Powerful... mysterious...
At the boundary of eternity

Nothing escapes, not even light
Beyond the mystical horizon
We surrender to its might
Gazing into the eye of the universe

A deep roar is sounding
Deafening... thunderous...
As if the universe were crying
My heart is pounding
Frantic... delirious...
My every nerve is dying

[B. Halo Of Darkness]

I hear screams of fallen souls, sad cries of agony
Within the void of this evil hole, deep inside the black

Could it be my imagination, the mirror of my fantasy?
A fear-induced hallucination
Or is there no way back from the halo of darkness?

Spirits - apparitions - misery - suffering
Horrid dreams and dire visions rising up from the black

Look away in disbelief, this cannot be happening
The end has come, I bow in grief
There is no way back from the halo of darkness

[C. The Final Door]

Now silence devours us
Massive... suffocating...
The calm before the storm
Gravity overpowers us
Invincible... dominating...
And leads us through the final door

Nothing escapes, not even light
Beyond the mystical horizon
We surrender to its might
Gazing into the eye of the universe

Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feel my might, I'm the eye of the universe
