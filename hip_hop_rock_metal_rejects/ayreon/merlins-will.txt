MERLIN, WHO IS UNAFFECTED BY -AND THEREFORE IGNORANT
OF- THE 'TIME TELEPATHY' EXPERIMENT,
ASSUMES THAT AYREON'S PROPHECIES ARE DECEPTIVE,
AND SO AYREON MUST BE SILENCED.
OR COULD THERE BE AN UNDERTONE OF ENVY IN HIS WORDS?

[MERLIN:]
Ayreon, don't you know who I am
Ayreon, I'll have you know that I can
charm you with a wave of my hand
you bow to my command

Ayreon, you're an evil stranger
Ayreon, you've become a danger
your words are all but a lie
I vow that ye shall die

[KNIGHTS:]
it's Merlin's will, his will be done
the end has come for Ayreon
it's Merlin's will
and his will be done

[MERLIN:]
Ayreon, you're in my domain now
Ayreon, I renounce your name now
no one will know who you are
you'll fade out like a star
