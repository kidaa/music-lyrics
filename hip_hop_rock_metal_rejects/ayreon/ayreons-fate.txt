[A. Ayreon's fate]

AYREON DESPERATELY ATTEMPTS TO CONVINCE MERLIN OF HIS SINCERITY,
BUT MERLIN WON'T HEAR OF IT AND CASTS HIS SPELL ON POOR AYREON.

[AYREON:]
misguided Merlin
you fail to understand
I could never be your rival
I was just a pawn
in a future masterplan
for the purpose of survival

[MERLIN:]
Ayreon, I've cast my spell upon you
I have no faith, you cannot be true
Ayreon!

[AYREON:]
I forgive you Merlin
for you don't know what you've done
even for you, it was all a mystery
one day you'll see
that I was the one
who could change the course of history

[MERLIN:]
Ayreon, you're words are all in vain
close your eyes, there'll be no more pain
oh Ayreon...

[B. Merlin's prophecy]

MERLIN IS STRICKEN WITH GRIEF FOR HE HAS HAD A VISION
THAT PROVES AYREON TO BE GENUINE.
RELUCTANT TO PASS INTO ETERNITY AS THE MARTYR OF MANKIND,
MERLIN VOWS THAT AYREON'S WORD WILL BE SPREAD IN THE 20TH CENTURY,
IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE TOO LATE AND THAT MAN WILL HEED
HIS PREMONITIONS.

[MERLIN:]
I see one day
his story will be told
at the end of the 20th century
I see one day
the truth will unfold
and the quest has now begun
oh Ayreon!

I hope one day
that man will understand
it's in his power to change his destiny
I hope one day
he'll do all that he can
and all the nations will be one
oh Ayreon!
