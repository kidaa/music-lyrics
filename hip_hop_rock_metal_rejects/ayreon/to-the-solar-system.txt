"Finally we are approaching our own familiar solar system. But there is something wrong.
Reality begins to break through the illusion. I have an unsettling premonition that even
here inside my virtual journey I will never reach the Earth..."

[Robert Soeterboek]

[A. PLANET OF BLUE]

I can feel the sun burning on my skin
I can feel the sun from deep within
I can hear the earth calling out my name
I can hear the earth crying out in pain

I'm coming home to the planet of blue
Our own sun is coming into view
I'm reaching out to the planet of blue
Can you see me fly?
Can you feel me die?

I can almost touch the glorious rings of Saturn
But then I feel them slip away
I can almost see the yellow clouds of Venus
But then the sequence slowly fades

I'm coming home to the planet of blue
Is this the end, can it be true?
I'm reaching out to the planet of blue
Can you see me try?
Can you feel me die?
