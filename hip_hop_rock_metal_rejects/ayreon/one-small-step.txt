"It is the 20th century. I am a little boy peacefully asleep. My father comes to wake me
so that I can witness an historic event in the finite story of mankind."

[Edward Reekers, Lana Lane]

On an early summer morning, July '69
As I dream of the planets
I hear a voice softly whisper: 'son, it is time
It's happening soon'

It's a quarter to four now and he carries me down
To our place by the telly
I see lights on in houses all over town
For the man on the Moon

One small step for man
But a giant leap for mankind
The mighty Apollo prevailed
The Eagle has landed

I go back to my warm bed, back to my dreams
But not the one of the planets
I decided this morning I don't want to be
The man on the Moon

As I lie here in this cold tank, living a dream
I'm the last on the planets
I decided this morning I don't want to be
The man on Mars
