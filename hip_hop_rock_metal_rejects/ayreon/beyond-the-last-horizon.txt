Ready for the enemy hungry for the battle
Fighting hard for victory in the army of the king

Armed with shield and sword we mounted our horses
Leaving on a sacred quest
On our way to fight the holy war

They attacked from different sides
Hard pressed with numbers
Could not even run nor hide
We had to stand and fight
Then I felt a blade of steel
Penetrate my armor
I did not dream the pain was real
As I went down I knew my time had come

And then he rode into the night
Towards that eerie distant light
That seemed to charm him
Until he came to a road that disappeared
Beyond the last horizon
He knew there'd be no way back
Once he had vanished in the blackness of infinity
And so he gathered all his strength not to descend
Into the valley of death
Into the valley of death

I opened up my weary eyes
The haze slowly lifted
The mighty roar of battlecries
Stopped ringing in my ears
I gazed upon a friendly face
He carried me to safety
I told him of this frightening place
And of my journey back from the other side

And then he rode into the night
Towards that eerie distant light
That seemed to charm him
Until he came to a road that disappeared
Beyond the last horizon
He knew there'd be no way back
Once he had vanished in the blackness of infinity
And so he gathered all his strength not to descend
Into the valley of death
Into the valley of death

And then he rode into the night
Towards that eerie distant light
That seemed to charm him
A force so seductive
And yet so destructive and cruel
Until he came to a road that disappeared
Beyond the last horizon
He knew there'd be no way back
Once he had vanished in the blackness of infinity
And so he gathered all his strength not to descend
Into the valley of death
Into the valley of death

I followed that road to the edge of eternity
He knew there'd be no way back
Once he had vanished in the blackness of infinity

I fought for my life
For I had to survive the ordeal

And so he gathered all his strength
Not to descend into the valley of death
Into the valley of death
