[Me] I have always been creative, I don't understand 
Aspired to be an artist, not a business man 
[Pride] You need to show your old man you're in control 
To be successful, you'd sell your own soul!
you'd sell your own soul! 

[Me] I've always been respectable, I don't understand 
I tried to be compassionate, I'm not a ruthless man! 
[Pride] You need to show them you're superior, you lead the field 
No one opposes you, all man must yield! 
all man must yield! 

[Me] I've always been affectionate, don't understand 
I really love her, I'm not a heartless man! 
[Pride] You have no time for commitments, they get in the way 
Get down to business, there's no time to play! 

[Reason] You can still change, and right what is wrong 
[Pride] But can you swallow me, or am I too strong? 
[Reason] You have to get back now, it's not too late 
[Pride] It's not like you two resign to your fate 
[Reason] The loved ones are waiting, break out of you cage 
[Pride] You have the power, give in to your rage 
[Reason] Listen to Pride now, for once he is right 
[Pride] Listen to Reason, let us be your guide
