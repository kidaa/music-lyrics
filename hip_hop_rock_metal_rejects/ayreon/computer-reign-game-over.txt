AYREON DESCRIBES A DISTANT FUTURE IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY TRIUMPHS OVER PASSION,
AND 'SERVING' COMPUTERS WILL GRADYALLY GAIN CONTROL OVER MANKIND.

[AYREON:]
I see a future cold as ice
where all the love has gone
I see a race that pays the price
for everything it's done

I see shadows of giant machines
cast upon the land
I see a world where kings nor queens
but chips are in command

COMPUTER...COMPUTER...COMPUTER...
COMPUTER-REIGN

now the end has just begun
technology has won
and it cannot be undone
there will be nowhere to run
now the damage has been done

GAME OVER! GAME OVER!

I see a game gone out of hand
and memories erased
I see a programmed masterplan
and man will be replaced

I see a planet die in space
and slowly fade away
I see the end of the human race
there has to be a way
