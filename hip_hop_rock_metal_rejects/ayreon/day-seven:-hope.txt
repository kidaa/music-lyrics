[Best Friend] Let me take you back 
To the time when we were chasing all the girls 
Two maniacs 
Indulging in the pleasures of this world 

So much to see, so much to live for 
Questions to answer, places to go 
So much to be, so much to care for 
Deep down inside I think you know 
You are free...come back to me! 

Look ahead and see 
There are still so many borders we could cross 
Just you and me 
Making up for all the time that we have lost 

[Best Friend] So much to see 
[Me] He may be right 
[Best Friend] so much to live for 
[Me] I've got to fight 
[Best Friend] Questions to answer 
[Me] I will pull through 
[Best Friend] places to go 
[Me] take me with you 
[Best Friend] So much to be 
[Me] I will not break 
[Best Friend] so much to care for 
[Me] I must awake 
[Best Friend] Deep down inside I think you know 
[Me] I think I know 
[Best Friend] You are free 
[Me] I am free 
[Best Friend] Come back to me! 

[Best Friend] Aaaah, aaaah come back to me 
[Me] There's no way out, my whole world is black! 
[Best Friend] Aaaah, aaaah come back to me 
[Me] I try to shout, something's holding me back!
