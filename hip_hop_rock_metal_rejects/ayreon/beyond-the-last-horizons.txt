Ready for the enemy
Hungry for the battle
Fighting hard for victory
In the army of the king
Armed with shield and sword
We mounted our horses
Leaving on a sacred quest
On our way to fight the holy war

They attacked from different sides Hard pressed with numbers
We could not even run nor hide
We had to stand and fight
Then I felt a blade of steel
Penetrate my armour
I did not dream the pain was real
As I went down I knew my time
Had come 

And then he rode into the night Towards that eerie distant light
That seemed to charm him
Until he came to a road that Disappeared beyond the last horizon

He knew there'd be no way back
Once he had vanished in the Blackness of Infinity
And so he gathered all his strength
Not to descend into the valley of death Into the valley of death

I opened up my weary eyes
The haze slowly lifted
The mighty roar of battlecries
Stopped ringing in my ears
I gazed upon a friendly face
He carried me to safety
I told him of this frightening place and Of my journey back from the other side

And then they rode into the night Towards that eerie distant light that Seemed to charm him
A force so seductive and yet so Destructive and cruel
Until he came to a road that Disappeared beyond the last horizon

He knew there'd be no way back
Once he had vanished in the Blackness of infinity

And so he gathered all his strength Not to descend into the valley of death into the valley of
death 
I followed that road to the edge of Eternity he knew there'd be no way Back once he had
vanished in the Blackness of infinity
I fought for my life for I had to survive The ordeal
And so he gathered all his strength Not to descend into the valley of death Into the valley of
death
