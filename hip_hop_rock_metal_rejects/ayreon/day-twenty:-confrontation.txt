[Best Friend] See his mouth, he tries to speak 
He cannot move, his voice is weak... 
[Me] My dear friend can you hear me now? 
I'll try to tell you how I feel 
[Best Friend] I feel the pain inside of you 
Tell me please, what can I do? 
[Me] Listen well to what I have to say 
I have to tell you...of my betrayal 

[Me] I reveal the facts, it was clear 
It spelled the end of your career 
[Best Friend] Yes, I always felt that it was you 
I repressed the thought although I knew the truth 
[Me] The truth is out, I feel relieved 
You hate me now, you've been deceived? 
[Best Friend] Oh no, in a way we are even now 
Come back to us...somehow 

[Wife and Love] Cross that bridge to the other side 
Follow your heart, you can't go wrong 
Come with me, I will be your guide 
And lead you back where you belong 

[Agony] Welcome to reality, be ready for the pain 
Welcome to reality, will it be in vain 
Welcome to reality, 
Nothing much has changed since you were gone 

[Passion] Rise up and show the world you can be a better man 
Rise up and show the world you care, yes you can 
Rise up and show the world you're taking your chance 
Rise up and show the world! 
[Agony] Welcome back! 

[Reason] Welcome to reality, wake up and rejoice 
Welcome to reality, you've made the right choice 
Welcome to reality, and let them hear your voice, shout it out! 

[Pride] Rise up and show the world your battle is won 
Rise up and show the world the old you is gone 
Rise up and show the world your new life has begun 
Rise up and show the world! 
[Reason and Agony] Welcome back! 

[Fear] Here inside the question burns 
Are you sure of your return? 
[Me] I am sure I deserve this chance 
Now I understand it all 
[Fear] It all seems so unreal to you 
Can you decide what to do? 
[Me] Yes I can, oh I will survive 
Look at me...I'm alive 

[Wife and Love] Cross that bridge to the other side 
Follow your heart, you can't go wrong 
Come with me, I will be your guide 
And lead you back where you belong 

[Best Friend] There is so much to see, there is so much to live for 
[Wife] Come with me, my love 
[Reason] You feel her warmth, glowing on your skin 
[Love] You're never alone, I knew we could make it 
[Fear] Aaaaaaaaarrrrgh! 
[Passion] Can't you feel that fire, can't you feel it burn? 
[Agony] Be ready for the pain, ready for the pain! 
[Pride] Well rise up, your battle has been won, your new life has begun 
[Me] I'm alive, I won't look back, aaaaah!
