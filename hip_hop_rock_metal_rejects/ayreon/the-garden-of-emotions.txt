Behold: the Star Towers of the Electric Castle! See how it embraces the sky! How insignificant
the mere mortal, dwrfed by the majesty of its electric edifice! But first, my seven searchers -
you must meander through the verdant vines of the Garden of Emotions. Succomb to its allure.
Breathe deep the intoxicating aroma of endless, entwined emotions...

[A. IN THE GARDEN OF EMOTIONS]

[hippie]
it's kinda groovy
in this world of fantasy
where no one else can go
within these boundaries
I'm shielded from reality
without a care or woe

[egyptian]
Amon-ra, have you come to seal my fate?
in the garden of emotions
free my ka, how much longer must I wait?
in the garden of emotions

[hippie]
I roam the universe
in cosmic meditation
to find my inner me
I'm getting high on love
and spiritual vibrations
to set bad karma free

[egyptian]
Amon-ra, have you come to seal my fate?
in the garden of emotions
free my ka, how much longer must I wait?
in the garden of emotions
