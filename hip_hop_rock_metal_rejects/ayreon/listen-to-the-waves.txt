AYREON WARNS THE PEOPLE THAT IF MAN DOES NOT MEND HIS WAYS,
MAN WILL CONTAMINATE THE SKIES, SO THERE WILL BE NO MORE AIR TO BREATHE,
HE WILL POISON THE SEAS,
SO THERE WILL BE NO MORE WATER TO DRINK AND HE WILL POLLUTE THE LAND,
SO THERE WILL BE NO MORE FOOD TO LIVE ON.

[AYREON:]
all the trees have fallen
the soil is scorched and dry
I can't respire
a storm of fire
is raging in the sky

where is all the wildlife
extinct from pole to pole
the hunt for skin
a deadly sin
took it's heavy toll

the seas are red, the skies are grim
the soil is filled with graves
the earth is dead, the sun is dim
listen to the waves

we befoul the air
and burn a hole in the sky
deadly rays
from outer space
cause our race to die

standing at the crossroads
a choice of life and death
we'll take more care
and clear the air
or take our final breath
