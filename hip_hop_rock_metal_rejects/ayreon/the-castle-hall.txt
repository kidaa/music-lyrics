At last! you enter the Electric Castle! Here in this vast hall where even shadows fear the
light - here you must confront your past. If you have killed, beware of the Gathering of Spirits
for they do fish for men. Here, the disembodied Astral World becomes flesh once more. I pity the
men of swords.
For here blood runs cold...

[barbarian]
cries from the grave resound in my ears
they hail from beyond my darkest fears
faces of the past are etched in my brain
the women I raped, the men I've slain

shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
demons dance in the castle hall

[knight]
I call upon the sword, the mighty Excalibur
grant me the skill to fulfill my quest

I call upon my king and the knights of the table round
grant me the courage to stand to this test

I call upon the seer, Merlin the sorcerer
grant me the magic to end my pain

I call upon the spirit that lives in a noble heart
grant me the passion that's within my veins

shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
demons dance in the castle hall

[repeat hall]
