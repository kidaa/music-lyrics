[A. A new dawn]

A PERCEPTABLE TENSION IS HOVERING ABOVE AYREON'S HOMETOWN.
SOMETHING IS AT HAND.

[B. The gathering]

THE TOWNSPEOPLE GATHER ON THE MARKET SQUARE TO JUDGE OF AYREON.
IS HE A PROPHET OR A CHARLATAN, OR EVEN WORSE: AN APPARITION MOST UNHOLY?

[C. The accusation]

THE VILLAGERS ACCUSE AYREON OF BEING THE DEVIL'S SPAWN,
BUT AYREON PERSISTS IN HIS INNOCENCE.

[VILLAGERS:]
have you seen his eyes
up in the skies
like hypnotized
and he never smiles
he never cries

have you heard his song
fierce and strong
right or wrong
should he be condemned
for he doesn't belong

[AYREON:]
what have I done
[VILLAGERS:]
you've aroused the forces of destruction
[AYREON:]
what have I done
[VILLAGERS:]
you've unleashed the rage of the gods
[AYREON:]
what have I done
[VILLAGERS:]
you've denounced the wonder of creation
[AYREON:]
what have I done
[VILLAGERS:]
you've betrayed your own,
now you have to pay

it has been foretold
in days of old
'n evil soul
will corrupt the world
to achieve his goal

he's the devil's seed
an evil breed
he's gonna make you bleed
he'll take all he needs
with uncontrolable greed

[AYREON:]
I've done nothing at all,
no nothing at all

[D. The banishment]

WITH STICKS AND TORCHES IN HAND,
THE ANGRY VILLAGERS DRIVE AYREON OUT OF THEIR DEMESNE.

[E. Oblivion]

COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED AYREON ROAMS THROUGH THE FOREST,
ONLY AN INDISTINCT SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT SUSTAINS HIM.

[AYREON:]
if I have died, then this must be hell
if I'm alive, I cannot break this gruesome spell
I am seeking relief and finding none
I have fallen into oblivion

a force within dominates my tormented soul
and empowers me to regain absolute control
I shall not yield, for I am the chosen one
who shall rise from oblivion

GOOD FATE HAS GUIDED AYREON TO CAMELOT, KING ARTHUR'S CASTLE,
WHERE HE IS WELCOMED AS A WORTHY MINSTREL.
