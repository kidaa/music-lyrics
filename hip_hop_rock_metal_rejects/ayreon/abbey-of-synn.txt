Once upon a time as in Ancient history
High upon a hill in a shroud Of mystery
Loomed the abbey as we Journeyed through the night
And wended our way Towards the light

As we entered through the Gates
We heard the silent calls
There was something evil
That lurked within these Walls
As I relive my days in this Godforsaken place
All that appears before me Now...is her face

Another man died today like The ones before
With blackened tongue and Blackened finger
Within the labyrinth behind The bolted door
Lies the answer to our Mystery

Heed the book that kills -
It holds an evil power
Those who turn the leaves Wither like a flower
Well guarded by the seer Inside the abbey tower
For laughter kills the fear Within
The abbey of synn

We found the secret path That led us here to you
Give us the deadly book of Laughter
Too many men have died for A teaching of the few
Open up your heart reveal The mystery

Heed the book that kills -
It holds an evil power
Those who turn the leaves Wither like a flower
Well guarded by the seer Inside the abbey tower
For laughter kills the fear Within
The abbey of synn

And then she came 2 me Like a creature from the Dawn
Enchanting as the moon - Radiant as the sun
She took the boy in me and Gave me back the man
With a force I could not Withstand

The seer burned the abbey Down and perished in the fire
We couldn't save the book The flames were rising Higher
So many died in vain for an Ancient discipline
Laughter kills the fear within The abbey of synn

Heed the book that kills -
It holds an evil power
Those who turn the leaves Wither like a flower
Well guarded by the seer Inside the abbey tower
For laughter kills the fear Within
The abbey of synn
