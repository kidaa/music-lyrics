[Reason] You're driving home, It's one PM 
You cannot function, you're a broken man 
Your past is catching up with you 
Only her tenderness can help you through 

you see her smile, at another man 

[Wife] Did you see me smile at another man? 
It was only us, please understand... 

[Reason] 
You see him hold her, in his arms 

[Wife] Did you see him hold me in his arms? 
We needed warmth, we meant no harm... 

[Agony] Love left you, without me you're all alone! 

[Reason] Tears of sorrow fill your eyes 
Your cold and wretched life flashes by 
Is that your father standing there? 
You turn the wheel, you no longer care... 

You saw her smile at another man 

[Wife] Did you see me smile at another man? 
It was only us, please understand... 

[Reason] You saw him hold her, in his arms 

[Wife] Did you see him hold me in his arms? 
We needed warmth, we meant no harm... 

[Agony] Love left you, without me you're all alone! 
Love wrecked you! 

[Passion] You saw her smile at another man 
Now you finally understand 
He held her in his arms 
You've nothing left, it's gone too far... 

[Agony] Your memory begins to clear 
Now you see what brought you here 
You try to open up your eyes 
But the doubts will leave you paralyzed 

[Wife] I smiled at another man 
Please understand... 
He held me in his arms 
We meant no harm... 

[Agony] Love left you, without me you're all alone! 
Love wrecked you, I am the oldest friend you known!
