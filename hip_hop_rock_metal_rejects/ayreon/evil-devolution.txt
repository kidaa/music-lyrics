The future's doored ingress! What lies beyond? One of you - ah, survived so much! - are you man
enough to force this door upon its golden hinge? You craved the answer - but can you bear the
truth? The door --! The Future --!

[futureman]
our hope's dissolved
for man's evolved into another state of being
have we "progressed" beyond the need of feeling?

a cyber-brain
the last in the chain of man/machine allience
have we become the victims of our science?

evil devolution
is this an illusion
out here in space

human humiliation
this mutation
of our human race

is this the end
will we transcend the need for human pleasures?
will we abandon all our earthly treasures?

will mankind yield
on the battlefield of natural selection
to an inorganic digital perfection?

evil devolution
is this an illusion
out here in space

human humiliation
