[A. METAMORPHOSIS]

"For the first time during my journey, the Migrator communicates with me. He speaks to me
directly, but without words. The Migrator tells me that my corporeal body inside the
Dream Sequencer has died. While my body will now sleep forever, my conciousness must
awake to eternity that lays before me ... for I am the new Migrator!"

[B. SLEEPER AWAKE]

[Ian Parry, Lana Lane]

Atomically into existence
A creator of life was born
This universal migrator
In his celestial form

Astronomical segmentation
A division from which I came
To go forth with a task bestowed me
And seek out new worlds for all

Fly up into the skies
A sea of blue has crossed thine eyes
A quest to save mankind is made
Just one earthly being his soul shall remain

My power of thought calls you
Sleeper...sleeper awake, oh you sleeper
Open your mind hear me sleeper
Sleeper awake, come alive
Our spirits they can never die

Sleeper...sleeper awake, oh you sleeper
Dormant inside, hear me sleeper
Sleeper awake, come alive
Your body is dead not your mind

A cataclysmic end for many
Annihilated Earth to the core
But one soul survives in stasis
A colonists spirit the source

You're the one not I, the chosen
With visions, a bright new dawn
To cross the starlit systems
A place where new planets are born

Rise up, you must awake
The here and now shall separate
The body frees the soul and mind
Your spirit will join me in time

Sleeper awake there's a world waiting for you to find!
