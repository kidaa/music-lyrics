"It is the 22nd century. I am the last of the Mars Colonists. The air
supply has almost run out on this desolate Mars colony, and the food
supplies from Earth have stopped arriving since the final war of 2084. I
am walking through the tunnel towards our recreation machine called the
Dream Sequencer. I hope it will sweeten my final days..."
