Lying on my back on a railway
Looking at the sky and its full moon
In the back of my head I feel the rumbling wheels
Shaking my memories

It's getting darker and darker and darker
My hands are frozen and steam comes out of my mouth
As I whisper my last words
Seem to fade away

The train is moving forward and closer
Can't stand up and walk away
Once I made my mind up so long ago
Now I can't change
It is just too bad

I feel so left alone, so forgotten
Nobody knows where I am, no one misses me
Cold water runs from my eyes
And the cold is freezing my last tears
Like I'm only half in my body, I can't feel
I think I'm already half gone, I can't think
It's getting colder and colder and colder
I can't breathe

The train is moving forward and closer
Can't stand up and walk away
Once I made my mind up so long ago
Now I can't change
It is just too bad

Cold metal - burning in my back
Cold cold metal - freezing
Cold cold metal - my head will burst open
Cold cold metal - it's been too much
