From the wind-torn ramparts of the Tower of Hope we survey a thousand futures. Release your
dreams from this electric pinnacle. You must have hope...

[hippie]
we're climbing up the stairs
and hope is flowing through our veins

[futureman]
there's magic everywhere
we've been released of all our chains

[hippie]
we're taking in the view oceans of blue,
fields of green

[futureman]
I fear this can't be true
we're still inside this dream machine

[chorus]
[hippie] I only felt what I wanted to feel 
[futureman] I only saw what I wanted to see
[hippie] I'm at the end of my rope
[both] lost in the tower of hope

[hippie]
I see a brand new age
where peace and harmony prevail

[futureman]
but we're still in this cage
destined to die here if we fail

[chorus & repeat second verse]

[hippie] I only felt what I wanted to feel
[futureman] I only saw what I wanted to see
[hippie] I only went where I wanted to go
[futureman] I only knew what I wanted to know
[both] and we became who we wanted to be
[hippie] I only felt what I wanted to feel 
[futureman] I only saw what I wanted to see
[hippie] I'm at the end of my rope 
[both] lost in the tower of hope
