[A. LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN]

[highlander]
what heathen place is this that I've arrived in
is now the time I pay for all my sins
I can't believe that this is God's creation
this realm was fashioned by the Deil's ane hand

[indian chorus]
no it has been foretold, in our legends of old
wake the spirit within, let the journey begin

[highlander]
this quest you speak of is for redemption
how can we travel when our souls are lost
you think we find ourselves at gates of new salvation
when I can only sense the end is here

[indian chorus]

[knight]
we're at the gates of Avalon, the island of spirits,
we're at the gates of Avalon, in search of the grail

[B. THE HALL OF ISIS AND OSIRIS]

[roman]
there's no way out, slaves for eternity
down in the underworld, the jaws of Orcus
I call on Jupiter, the ruler of the gods
show us the way, from damnation to salvation

[egyptian chorus]
the fields of Yaaru lie waiting for us all
rejoice! the judges have ruled
we have been chosen to enter the great hall
of Isis and Osiris

[roman]
no you're wrong, we're trapped here in darkness
among departed souls, and mislaid spirits
I call on Mars, the ancient god of war
grant me the power, to free me from this evil

[egyptian chorus]

[C. STRANGE CONSTELLATIONS]

[highlander]
can you see the stars? can you recognize the constellations?
if I could only see the hills that we're supposed to climb
even the sunlight.....it doesn't
warm.....doesn't wam
how are we gonna find our way?
if we can't recognize the stars, if we can't recognize the constellations
where do we go?

[D. REPRISE]

[highlander]
the quest you speak of, it isn't bound for glory
no grail exists within this heathen land
you think we find ourselves at gates of new salvation
when I can only sense...the end is near
