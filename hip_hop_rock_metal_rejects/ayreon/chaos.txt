"I am the last human being alive. I am inside a machine called the Dream Sequencer on a
deserted Mars colony. I have selected the program called "The Universal Migrator". This
program creates a form of hypnosis which allows me to return to the very beginning of
life itself. From the safety of the energy tank in which I lie, I travel all the way back
to the period before The Big Bang where matter, energy and time itself all intermingle in
the chaotic unformed vacuum of proto space."

soul called the Universal Migrator. However, system protocols require confirmation of
risk factor. No user has ever preincarnated back this far before.
