[Love] Faith has come to warn 
That you far to long forsaken her heart 

Move to the truth 
Breath the sunlight burning in her open arms 

Break the chains that 
Bind you to a past that feeds this bitter days 

Seize your only chance 
Follow the stars that beckon you through blackened skies 

[Wife] Can you feel me touch your aching heart 
I can sense how much you're missing me... 

Give me a sign, show me you're there 
I am sure you'll find a way back to me 

[Me] I can't believe I turned so vile 
How could I've ignored her smile? 
She was always there to easy my pain 
I am so ashamed 

I wonder why she stayed with me 
How she endured my vanity 
I wish I could go back and mend my ways 
Is it too late? 

[Wife] Can you see, I swear it's true, a teardrop trickling down his cheek? 
[Best Friend] Yes, indeed, I see it too, could it be he's hurting inside? 
[Wife] Don't you think we should be glad he feels anything at all? 
[Best Friend] It could well be he cries because of us 
[Wife] Does it matter why he cries? 
[Best Friend] What's going on in his mind? 
[Wife] Has he's given us a sign? 

[Wife] Can you see, I swear it's true, him clenching his right hand into a fist? 
[Best Friend] Yes, indeed, I see it too, could it be that he's raging inside? 
[Wife] Don't you think we should be glad he has any thoughts at all? 
[Best Friend] It could well be he angry because of us 
[Wife] Does it matter if he is? 
[Best Friend] What's going on in his mind? 
[Wife] Has he's given us a sign?
