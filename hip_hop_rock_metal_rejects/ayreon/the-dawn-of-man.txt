More than a million years ago it came To earth out of the sky from whence it Came is still
unknown and still we Don't know why

Way beyond infinity where time is lost And life has ceased to be there's a Cosmic entity a
bringer of life for all Eternity is this how it all began? the Dawn of man

More than a million miles from earth Somewhere in outer space behold a Planetary birth making
way for a brand New race
