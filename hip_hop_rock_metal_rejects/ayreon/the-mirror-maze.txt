It is time to reflect upon your "ego-self". Nowhere to hide when the walls echo the you that we
all see. Ah, the smiles dissolve! The pulse begins to race; the face a flush of fear so plainly
painted. The Mirror World - the Mirror Maze: Confrontation...

[A. INSIDE THE MIRROR MAZE]

[hippie]
mirror mirror I can see a lonely child, he kinda looks like me
staring out into infinity
his father lies, his mother cries, his spirit flies up in the skies
wandering off to another galaxy

[futureman]
secret fears we all try to hide
lie dormant deep inside us
defy the ghosts of long forgotten days
here inside the mirror maze

[hippie]
mirror mirror I can see an angry boy, oh well I guess he's me
rising up to the society
he's aware that no one cares and life's unfair so he growa his hair
and takes a trip into eternity

[futureman]
secret fears we all try to hide
lie dormant deep inside us
defy the ghosts of long forgotten days
here inside the mirror maze

[B. THROUGH THE MIRROR]

[roman] I see a man, who's unable to withstand his fears inside
[knight] inside we're all but frightened men
but we have to fight until the end is here
[roman] hear what I say: I am doomed,
I have to pay, I can't go on
[knight] go on and persevere
for we have to make it out of here alive
[roman] a life is but a dream,
for in the mirror I have seen what lies within
[knight] within this armour cold and bright
lies a noble heart with the will to fight the pain
[roman] the pain cannot be healed,
I'm surrounded by this shield I cannot break
[knight] break through the mirror now
follow me, I will show you how

[roman] we've reached the other side,
I have overcome my pride and made it through
[knight] we threw aside our darkest fears
and stepped across these new frontiers of time
[roman] time can only tell what awaits us in this hell full of deceit
[knight] deceit, guile and treachery
will they ever set us free again?

[roman] riding on the wings of time
