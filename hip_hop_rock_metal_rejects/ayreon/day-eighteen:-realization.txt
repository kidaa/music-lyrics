[Reason] Now you know the truth, what will you do? 
[Me] I still can't believe it's true... 
[Passion] You better believe it, and make them pay! 
[Me] There has to be another way... 

[Pride] You cannot take this lying down! 
[Me] I cannot stand up, can you show me how? 
[Love] You must forgive them and open your heart 
[Me] It's all my fault, it tears me apart! 

[Agony] It would have been better if you would have just died! 
[Me] No, I've got to win this fight! 
[Fear] Can you face them after all you did? 
[Me] I gotta reveal the feelings I hid 

[Best Friend] See him fight, he's all on his own... 
[Me] I need your help, can't do it alone! 
[Wife] Listen to me, can you hear me shout? 
[Me] Let me out!
