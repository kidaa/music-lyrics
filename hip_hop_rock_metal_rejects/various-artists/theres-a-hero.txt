Written by Don Cook, John Jarvis

There's a flower in the smallest garden
Reaching for the light 
There's a candle in the darkest corner
Conquering the night 
There is amazing strength In a willing hand 
There are victories 
That you've never planned 
There's a hero 
In everybody's heart There's a fire inside of everybody
Burning clear & bright 
There's a power in the faintest heartbeat
That cannot be denied 
Go on and trust yourself 
Cause you can ride the wind 
You're gonna take your dreams 
Where's they've never been 
There's a hero In everybody's heart 

Go on and trust yourself 
Cause you can ride the wind 
You're gonna take your dreams 
Where they've never been 
There's a hero In everybody's heart
