Oh, mairzy doats and dozy dotes and liddle lamzy divy,
A kiddly divy too, wooden shoe?
Oh mairzy doats and dozy dots and liddle lamzy divy,
A kiddly divy too, wooden shoe?
Now, if the words sound queer, and funny to your ear,
A little bit jumbled, and jivy,
Sing 'Mares eat oats, and Does eat oats, and little lambs eat ivy'
