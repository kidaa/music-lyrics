Celine Dion---God Bless America
Written by Irving Berlin

While the storm clouds gather far across the
sea, let us swear allegiance to a land that's free.
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
raise our voices in a solemn prayer.

God Bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Thru the night with a light from above.
From the mountains to the prairies,
To the oceans white with foam.
God Bless America, my home sweet home.
God Bless America, my home sweet home.
