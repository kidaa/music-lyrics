A dream got broken,
it seemed like all was lost.
What will be the future,
couldn't you pay the cost?
You wonder, will there ever be,
a second time around?

Woahoah-woahoah, when the tears are over
and the moment has come,
say "My lord I think I found someone".
And no one would be better,
to be puttin' it together,
for the second time around.

Ooooooh. We got the women and men.
Oooooooh-ooooooh-oooooooh. We got the kids and the clan.
Ooooooh. Only time will tell ya.
How do these dreams fit under one umbrella?

Step by step, day by day.
A fresh start over,
a different hand will play.
The deeper we fall,
The stronger we stay.
And we'll be better,
the second time around.
Step by step, day by day day by day.
A fresh start over,
a different hand will play.
Time will tell
but you know what they say.
We'll make it better,
second time around.
