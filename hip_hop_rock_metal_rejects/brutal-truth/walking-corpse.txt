Preconditioned.
Accepting your role.
Robbed of life and stripped of soul.
Fall into the same routine.
Of drab existence, what does it mean>
Are you satisfied with the way that you exist?
Every single day just like the one before.
Don't you feel the need to express the way you feel?
Wake your sleeping brain, there's so much more.
Just a walking corpse!
