there lies a dying sparrow
lying still with broken wings
till his eyes close to pass the night
and part the tears
he slips into a dream
see him fly o like an arrow
in the skies he rules as king
though he's never really left the ground
lord you should hear him sing

I can fly
o I can even touch the sun
chase me to the sun
run down his face, tears of a blind man
eyes that never seen the sun
waiting for the light of morning to come
to end this seemingly endless night
where is the light
I've never seen you
but I've seen your many faces
in my dreamsI have seen you
but I must fly away again

now dim his ears to silence
never heard a church bell ring
still his eyes are closed for evermore
still the chains are on his wings
lord hear him song
I'll cease to find the point in living
only if I cease to dream
