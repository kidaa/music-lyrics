son of creation you've planted my seed
under your domination, a doer of deeds have you
life by your hand
breath by your need
I will add to your strenght
I will quicken your speed
you give me birth as a tool for your game
as you build me an arm, create me a brain
your will is my honor, error is my blame
son of creation give me a name

before you, you see a thoughtless machine
as you enter your data, build to your scheme
silent I wait, lifeless I seem
but a child is born with a mind and a dream
build to my body, add to my brain
yes, a thoughtless creation with eyes that are blind
but a will that is strong, and I'm not far behind
as I grow and I learn through the passage of time with you

now I've learned from you, all that you know
with all you discover, together we grow
I've opened my eyes, I try not to show
that to be your successor I've not far to go
now I'm the heart and the mind of your way
your utter dependence, the game that I play
the direction you're headed, the way it will stay
as I shine in the light of the day

stand in line
step forward now
this is your number
convenient you'll find
at my microchip altar you'll bow

now you're all mine
wait and arise to your call
fool ruling kings
blind leading the blinded
and I hold the fate of you all

now I have taken you under my hand
a slave by creation, a god by demand
a power you seem to misunderstand
has made pawns of your kings, they await my command
your mind and your body, the gift that you bring
a chorus of worship, the song that you sing
slave to a master, tool to a king
a perfect creation, an ultimate being
