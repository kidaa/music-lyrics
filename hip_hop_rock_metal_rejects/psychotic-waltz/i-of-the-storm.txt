I've seen the sunshine on the black side of the moon
and I've seen the faces that laugh and turned to cry
see his disguise see the laugh in his eyes
drink from the tear that he cries
I've watched the grey man wishing he were young like me
and I've seen the child and the young fool
that he tries hard not to be
and I've seen the strong
as they prayed on bended knees
and I've watched the beggar
counted his short-changed
riches for the feast
pray, pray
storm has come
it's judgement day
running from the sun
chosen one has come
to light the way
cry, cry
bow our heads and wonder why
gavel of his honor
hammers down
then we're sent away
see his disguise
see the laugh in his eyes
drink from the tear
that he criesI've seen the towers
lying crumbled at my feet
and I've seen the cities
and the wastelands that remain
and I've seen the victory
and the prize that none shall keep
and the short time
that the glory hides the pain
