I used to think maybe you loved me, now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'till the day when you knock on my door
Now everytime I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'till you write me you're coming around

I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
And don't it feel good!!

Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good!!

I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I just can't spend my whole life just a waiting for you
I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
'Cause baby I just want you back and I want you to stay

I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
And don't it feel good!!

Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good!!
wooo,
And don't it feel good!!
And don't it feel good!!

I'm walking on sunshine

I feel alive, I feel the love, do wop, do wop
I feel alive, I feel the love, do wop, do wop

I'm walking on sunshine, wooah
