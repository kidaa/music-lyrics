Can anybody find me somebody to love
Each morning I get up I'm tired of it all
Can't barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
What are you doing to me
I have spent all my years believin' in you
But I just can't get no relief
But somebody
Somebody 
Can anybody find me somebody to love

Got no feel I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm okay I'm alright
It shows that there's no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day I'm gonna be free
Lord somebody
Somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love

She works hard Everyday
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of wonder in my brain
Got no common sense 
I've got nobody left to believe

Find her somebody to love x6
Can anybody find me

Somebody To Love

Find me somebody to love x5
