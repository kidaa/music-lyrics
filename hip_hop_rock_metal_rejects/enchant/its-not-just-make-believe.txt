Hey yeah ohhh yeah ohh yeah eah yeah

I thought that I was to old to believe in fairy tales
But there's letter from you waiting when I checked my mail

I start to shake like a 7 on the rickter scale when you say you love me

I look in the mirror and I'm not who I used to be at all 

It's coming clearer 

I'm Cinderella at the ball I'm Alice growing 10 feet tall 
It's not just make believe

Here comes the prince's kiss I'm positive the slipper fits 

It's not just make believe

It started out like just another ordainary day  
Now suddenly my lifes diffrent in every way

The sun is brighter and my happness is hear to stay 
It's like I'm dreaming

Thank you for showing me that true love doesn't hurt when you fall

You got me glowing 

I'm Cinderella at the ball I'm Alice growing 10 feet tall 

It's not just make believe

Here comes the prince's kiss 
I'm positive the slipper fits it's not just make believe

Whenever wherever forever I'll be with you 

We have it it's magic ohhhh

Look in the mirror and I'm not who I used to be at all

It's coming clearer

I'm Cinderella at the ball I'm Alice growing 10 feet tall
It's not just make believe

This feeling happening I feel so good I gotta sing 
It's not just make believe

Ariel above the sea I'm Beauty dancing with The Beast

It's not just make believe

Here comes the prince's kiss I'm positive the slipper fits

It's not just make believe
Ohhh yeah 

It's not just make believe it's not just make believe
Ohhh yeah yeah ohhh yeah

It's not just make believe
