The fear, passing faith, death upon my knees
The tears from your eyes, shadows that sign
I hold the earth within my hands,
O take the beauty that glimpsed you first
Thrash the world within your shores
It's in your arms that I die
Turn your eyes towards my sympathy
O be my thoughts to dance the earth with me
Take my hand as if it was yours and see
The glimpse of dreams your oceans bring
I hold the earth within my hands
O take the beauty that glimpsed you first
Thrash the world within your shores
It's in your arms that I die
Hold on to me all beauty is prospered in you
Your envy has poisoned the hearts of many
O of many, my oceans vast, I pour in you
For love I have journeyed a thousand times
Even upon the backs of many have I drowned
Here in your arms I would steal from fear
Suffer with me now and I might fright the world
