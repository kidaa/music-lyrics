The grief that lies bleeding in me
No less in pity than in glory
O creatures that are dearest to me...
...put on your crowns
I look into the sky and dream of oceans that are vast
O go to them, it is the vow of mine...
...danger lies ahead
With you my sensual queen of natural conception
That your hands find the eiderdown hard
Body of heavenly picture and flower
It is you that holds the secret to all our worlds
Of all your pleasures, beauty, that I taste
So true in bondage that I fresh the mind
O free my lungs that others of thought forbid
My soul has but ached,
But still I am all that's left of you
Sit my lover, upon your throne
If chains are of words, my heart is worn
O shall the voices be as pleasing as forever
And forever naked I stand amongst you
The grief that lies bleeding in me
No less in pity than in glory
O creatures that are dearest to me...
...I search in doubt
Honour, honour that I feel
I am no more worthy that I am human
Let your tongue lesh me...
...and rain, yes it shall rain
I am yours forever
