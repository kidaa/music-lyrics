Sailing of the century - a human life raft floating
the jaws of the void approaching - growing closer by the hour
Played lottery with destiny - could not believe you'd lose
Collect your one-way ticket for "the Good Ship Earth's" last cruise

So play today
go make your hay beneath a warm sun shining
But bear in mind one day you'll find the silver cloud's dark lining

Poor general intelligence - all that is rank promoted
Distended bellies bloated - gorged on candy-coated lies
Though honest as the day is long - dark nights are drawing in
yet for one grow tired of this - a devil sick of sin

So play today
go make your hay beneath a warm sun shining
But bear in mind one day you'll find the silver cloud's dark lining

Stand in line and pay your dime, to watch Atlantis rising
When do you'll see right through to the silver cloud's dark lining

Oblivion comes calling - expel your last breath praying
Hear the hounds of Hades baying - find there's nowhere left ot run
Across the fence midst greener grass a serpent winks his eye
for each of us he's baked a slice of home made apple-pie !

So play today
go make your hay beneath a warm sun shining
But bear in mind one day you'll find the silver cloud's dark lining

Played lottery with destiny - could not believe you'd lose
Collect your one-way ticket for "the Good Ship Earth's" last cruise

So play today
go make your hay beneath a warm sun shining
But bear in mind one day you'll find the silver cloud's dark lining

Stand in line and pay your dime, to watch Atlantis rising
When do you'll see right through to the silver cloud's dark lining
