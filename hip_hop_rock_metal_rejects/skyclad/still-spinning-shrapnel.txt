All I hear are peace talks and battle cries.

Everyone's losing - nobody's winning,
So run for your lives when the shrapnel's spinning.

Pictures of the crippled - wounded on the frontline
Someone else's problem - you're sitting on a landmine.
When will we see reason?  Sometimes I think we'll never
Learn that children have the right to laugh - and dying is forever

All I hear are peace talks and battle cries.

No time for laughter - we're too busy dying,
In this 'Devil's Playground' - bullets are flying.

There's another star in heaven - and footprints on the moon
So ignore the reign of terror - the bloody red monsoon.
Neighbour fighting neighbour - oh see how quick they run
To tear down the white flag and pick up the gun.

Peace talks and battle cries - apathy can kill
Put a price on human life - pay 'the butcher's bill'.
Everybody's losing - nobody's winning,
Run for your lives when the shrapnel's spinning.

Hear my prayer from the Valley of the Shadow -
For a child in an unmarked grave.
Take my hand in the hour of darkness -
While there's someone left to save.

But you can't hear me - all you can hear are...

Peace talks and battle cries - apathy can kill,
Put a price on human life - pay 'the butcher's bill'.
No time for laughter - we're too busy dying,
In this 'Devil's Playground' where bullets are flying.

I think about the children who have no hopes or homes,
Born into a battlfield - war's all they've ever known.
Neighbour loving neighbour - will that day ever come
When we shake hands in friendship and survey the damage done.

All I hear are peace talks and battle cries.

Everyone's losing - nobody's winning,
So run for your lives when the shrapnel's spinning.

Hear my prayer from the Valley of the Shadow -
For a child in an unmarked grave.
Take my hand in the hour of darkness -
While there's someone left to save.

Why won't you help me?
Why can't you hear me?
