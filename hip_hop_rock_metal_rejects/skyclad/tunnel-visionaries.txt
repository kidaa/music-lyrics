NarrationNobody could have conceived in the final decade of the 20th century
That our humble affairs were being manipulated by computer interface.
Not a soul could have summised that the lives of billions were of
Less consequence than a decimal point in the stock exchanges of the world.

Rare few even questioned the relentless exploitation of our rapidly
Dwindling natural resources.  And yet across the polished boardroom tables,
Beings immensely more devious than ourselves surveyed this defiled planet
With jaundiced eyes, and swiftly and ruthlessly, they hatched foul plots
Against us.
