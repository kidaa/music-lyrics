Drawers of water - hewers of wood,
Biting their tonques as if they know what's good for them.
Floating voters perched high upon fences in flame.

Charmed by pipes - drugged with ale,
Simple minds - born to fail,
Father please tell a tale of turncoat rebellion.

Watch us quietly disappear at the call for volunteers.
Eager to please - keep your noses to the grindstone.
Eager to please - your shoulders to the wheel.

Tuggers of forelocks - doffers of caps,
Blinded by greed they stepped into the traps laid for them.

Given a video - sattelite dish,
National Lottery - Saturday wish,
Simple lives - tropical fish in habitat aquaria.

Mad as hell but afraid to speak,
Our thin red line is a yellow streak.
Eager to please - keep your backs to the plough.
Eager to please - as we grow so we weep.

Charmed by pipes - drugged with ale,
Simple minds - born to fail,
Father please tell a tale of Turncoat Rebellion.
