Dance with the lilies in the shadows of the valley -
my lily of the valley of the shadow of death.

Her velvet shadow in the rain, disturb the stillness of the hour.
Each crimson kiss a tender pain, like plucking petals from a flower.

She took me pure as driven snow - held my hand and then let go.

Matriarch of lust nocturnal - fill her vessel with your fire.
Child endowed with life eternal - taste the well of her desire.

She is my mother in darkness.

A pierced lip - a warm embrace, ice blue eyes that chill my heart,
Valkyrie kisses burn my face - this "red thirst" tears my world apart.

What is a poor boy meant to do? I close my eyes and wish I knew.

She rip the throats from singing angels,
White wings stained red with ruby tears.

Bare limbs entwined within a casket wrapped in bloody afterglow.
So many questions we could ask - but do we really need to know?

Now she is my mother in darkness.

Her velvet shadow in the rain...
Dance with the lilies in the shadows of the valley -
my lily of the valley of the shadow of death.

She is my mother in darkness.
