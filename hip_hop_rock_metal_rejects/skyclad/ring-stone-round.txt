An apple in the eye of the storm that's coming
When winds of change sweep 'cross the land
These "old grey men" have braved the weather
Watched kingdoms fall while they still stand.

Walk with me down moonlit ley-lines
Farther than the eye can see
Where each breath lasts a thousand lifetimes
That is where I long to be.

Down at Ring Stone Round together
Down at Ring Stone Round
Down at Ring Stone Round together
Down at Ring Stone RoundAm I a fool - am I a dreamer?
Well ask me if I really care
And when your hearts and eyes have opened
I will meet you there.

Down at Ring Stone Round come follow
Down at Ring Stone Round
Down at Ring Stone Round tomorrow maybe?
