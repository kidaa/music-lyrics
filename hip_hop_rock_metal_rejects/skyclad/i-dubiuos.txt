I am the king of all that I survey
beware my son it could be yours one day.
Hier transparent to a dynasty -
dog - emperor of woe and misery.
It sent me mad but now it makes me furious
I'm shadowed by a doubt - I dubious.

Too many handshakes - not enough sincerity.
Promises of glass break - spilling poisoned trechery.

I'm a founding member of the Pessimist Society,
I talk to my reflection 'cause I trust it not to lie to me.

Jesus loved Judas - Judas kissed Jesus.
Ceasar loved Brutus - Brutus killed Ceasar.

I am the king of all that I survey
beware my son it could be yours one day.
Hier transparent to a dynasty -
dog - emperor of woe and misery.
It sent me mad but now it makes me furious
I'm shadowed by a doubt - I dubious.

Playing noughts and zeros - on my Boolean table.
We're warts and all heroes of this true - life fable.

I'm the entertainer at the Bunkcupt Club reunion,
if there's a church of failure - I'll kneel and take communion.

Wed to Delilah - shorn in my sleep.
Sentenced by Pilate - and nailed up to weep.

I am the king of all that I survey
beware my son it could be yours one day.
Hier transparent to a dynasty -
dog - emperor of woe and misery.
It sent me mad but now it makes me furious
I'm shadowed by a doubt - I dubious.
