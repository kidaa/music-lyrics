All you needed was somebody with a dream,
A fool to crucify or to put upon a pedestal.
Only dead fish float with the stream -
Compared with you I seem like an extra-terrestrial.

I'm not your Robin Hood or Peter Pan,
I won't play Jesus Christ - Santa Claus.
I'll never pass for a superman -
I'm just an effect trying to find a cause.

Tell me who am I, what am I and why am I here.

Is it because I'm flesh and blood
That creature comforts feel so good?
I give my body all it needs -
It sleeps and eats and shits and breeds.

And if I keep my feelings stum,
Hard luck - bibo ergo sum.
Just trying to do the best I can
Is a giant leap for this small man.

All you needed was somebody with a dream,
A fool to crucify or to put upon a pedestal.
Only dead fish float with the stream -
Compared with you I seem like an extra-terrestrial.

You say that life is a miracle -
I don't believe one word.
Forgive me for being so cynical -
From down here you all look absurd.

So are you happy now we all feel the same?
Martyrs to the cause - boredom level nearing terminal.
You're afraid to go against the grain,
Next to you I feel like a shining intellectual.James T. Kirk - Albert Einstein,
Sitting safe aboard the Enterprise.
If you're out there send me a sign -
I need somebody to sympathise with.

Tell me who am I, what am I and why am I here.

Must I succumb to every urge -
First feast and fast then binge and purge.
My spirit's strong - my flesh is weak,
I laugh and cry and scream and speak.

And sometimes when i feel confused,
I walk a path I did not choose.
Watch my life on video -
A private homemade horror show.

All you needed was somebody with a dream,
A fool to crucify or to put upon a pedestal.
Only dead fish float with the stream -
Compared with you I seem like an extra-terrestrial.

You're afraid to go against the grain,
