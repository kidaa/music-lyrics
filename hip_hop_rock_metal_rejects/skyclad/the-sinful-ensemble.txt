Are you ready...
Are you ready for The Sinful Ensemble?
Good clean fun - just a bit a rough and tumble.
Dead dictators out on a "labs night".
Then pints later you'll see a flashing blue light.

Ever wondered where the evil dead go?
There's a little place called "Nightmare scenario".
Unlicenced establishment for farmer world powers,
where the drinks are cheap - and it's open all hours.

Bonaparte's on brandy - he swills it down his throat,
Hitler sips a Pilsher while he tells a racist joke.
Mussolini leers at Maggie serving at the bar,
Stalin's out the back trying to sell a dodgy motor car.

Dear God above if you exist,
hope you see the funny side to this.
Now don't get cross - don't bite your nails,
oh, Son of Man your mission failed.

Herod's in the family room to baby sit the first born.
Mengele's got a Gladstone bag of cotton wool and chloroform.
Vlad impales glace cherries on a stick just for a lark
when Pol Pot turns the lights out they'll play murder in the dark.

Genghis Khan just parked his lunch all over Nero's belly.
While the lions beat the christians thirty - nil live on the telly.
Caligula kills "My Way" on the karaoke stage -
young "Chezzy" Borgia's barred for life for drinking under age.

This is far more than just a joke.
Can't you see the fire for the smoke?
Choose any public house you please
and find dictators such as these.

Hell is where the heart lies - in Purgatory's borders.
The great thing 'bout eternity - they never call last orders!
