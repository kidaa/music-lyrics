My mind was a timebomb
That was set to explode
So I packed up my cares
Into the sunset I rode
A path to hell that's paved
With good intentions.

Well I guess you and I
Will never see eye to eye
But if there's one thing I'll be
Glad to know when I die
It's that I never entertained your
'Can't Conventions.'

Two men gaze from behind
Their prison bars
One man sees dirt
The other sees stars

I'm just thinking aloud
Isn't thinking allowed?

Just let your mind wander
It may never come back
Set off on a new train of thought
On life's track.

I'm just thinking aloud
Isn't thinking allowed?
Why is nobody thinking?How can you call me a failure
Or a social defective
When to find your own mind
You'd need a private detective?
I'm not a statistic or
A regular family man.

I don't give a damn about public relations
I'll never live up to
Your great expectations
You can take or leave me
Just the way I am.

Your straight jacket emotions
Only stifle and kill
The spirit within us all
I call free will.

I'm just thinking aloud
Isn't thinking allowed?

Two men gaze from behind
Their prison bars
One man sees dirt
The other sees stars.

I'm just thinking aloud
Isn't thinking allowed?
