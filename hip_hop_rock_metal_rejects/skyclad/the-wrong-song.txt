Another bad break - burst another bubble
Another lost cause - here's another trouble
Another heart ache - one more chance gone
Another lost chord in yet another wrong song.

Sometimes I feel like I'm standing on a hillside -
Screaming at the world only wishing it would hear.
I can't deny that I'm tired of your lies
but I hope if I hide that you'll all disappear.

Can a fat man squeeze a camel through a needles eye? -
As hell freezes over the little pigs fly.

Just when things seemed better than before,
Listen there's a "black dog" howling at my back door.

You say I took it all the wrong way,
and got the wrong end of the stick.
Proceed to water down the truth,
then make me drink it 'til I'm sick.

It's a monkey shine - a mare's nest,
a cock and bull story.
You're talking through your hat,
you're full of sound and fury.

You're wide of the mark, on the wrong scent, barking up
the wrong tree, out of it, not a leg to stand on.

Dignity is one thing that you can't preserve in alcohol,
here's a drug to blow your mind - it's called sodium pentothal.
I've smelt more rats in my time than a sanitary inspector,
so every word you start to speak sets off my lie detector.

Another bad break - burst another bubble
Another lost cause - here's another trouble
Another heart ache - one more chance gone
Another lost chord in yet another wrong song.

Truth often hurts - but it hit me like a hammer,
I've been sweating blood for "product" - I thought it was my art.
Would it have made it tougher all I've had to suffer
if you'd come clean and told me the score from the start?

Stop treating everybody like a charity
I may have sold my soul - but I won't part with my sanity.

I was a schizophrenic - my better half left home,
The Samaritans don't answer when I call them on the telephone.

You say the cheque is in the post,
and it'll sound great at the mix.
But we have heard them all before,
have we the memory span of fish?

It's a monkey shine - a mare's nest,
a cock and bull story.
You're talking through your hat,
you're full of sound and fury.

You're wide of the mark, on the wrong scent, barking up
the wrong tree, out of it, not a leg to stand on.

Dignity is one thing that you can't preserve in alcohol,
here's a drug to blow your mind - it's called sodium pentothal.
I've smelt more rats in my time than a sanitary inspector,
so every word you start to speak sets off my lie detector.

The wrong song.
