Here's just a few of the changes I'll make
when mankind appoints me king of Planet Earth
So pass me my crown my scepter and gown
Hear the first proclamation of Martin the I

Leaders who lied so that innocents died
pretending to cry, they beg for One's pardon
Protest? well they might - when imapaled on spikes
on the grounds that surround Buckingham palace garden

If there is a world left for the meek to inherit,
these bastards would bomb it the moment they get it
Bogged down in a mire - lost all sight of their goals
thought they gained the whole world - they've forsaken their souls

"On with their heads!",I'm the clown prince of fools
"if you don't get the joke it's your loss"
Love and laughter you see are the new currency
'cause greed's coinage is not worth a toss

Preachers who teach us that god loves his children
instruct us to pray - and then prey on our kids
They'll not squeal with glee as the answer to me
placed in coffins of offal - I'll anil down their lids

There's still plenty of poisonous fish in the sea
rich with more complexes than vitamine B
If trawling for assholes you'll net a fine catch
with skulls full of saw dust well I've got the match!

"On with their heads!",hear my royal decree
"shut your mouth" - "it could open your mind"
What a chance there would be if someday we could see
one-eyed man in this land of the blind

"On with their heads!" now my word is the law
and your ignorant bliss is high treason
when the "thought-police" call for you, they will have a ball
cause the wise don't get mad they get even

"On with their heads!",I'm the clown prince of fools
"if you don't get the joke it's your loss"
Love and laughter you see are the new currency
'cause greed's coinage is not worth a toss

Crack-pot patricians - fascist politicians
wheelers and dealers - big-shot money makers
Mass redundancy down the frawd factory
now notice has been served on all liberty-takers

Those still unaware that a new age must dawn,
shall wake with their necks on the block come the morn
On my ferry to Styx everyone pays the toll
it's time to rock the boat - empty heads start to roll

"On with their heads!",hear my royal decree
"shut your mouth" - "it could open your mind"
What a chance there would be if someday we could see
one-eyed man in this land of the blind

"On with their heads!" now my word is the law
and your ignorant bliss is high treason
when the "thought-police" call for you, they will have a ball
cause the wise don't get mad they get even
