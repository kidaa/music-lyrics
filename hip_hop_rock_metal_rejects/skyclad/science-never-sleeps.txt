Science never sleeps - so I'm singing it a lullabye,
of wolves in sheeps clothing - devils in disguise,
and lab-coats draped over big black lies.

They cover their stupidity by calling it "stupology",
rearrange your world without one word of apology,
Make a man-made-soul so small it fits inside your pocket,
when you die they'll shoot it up to heaven in a rocket.

We've made tommorows world - a Nirvana for the damned.
We've made tommorows world - Mother Earth on Fatherland?
We've made tommorows world - we're the cause and the effect.
We've made tommorows world - could George Orwell be correct?

Science never sleeps - so I'm singing it a lullabye,
of wolves in sheeps clothing - devils in disguise,
and lab-coats draped over big black lies.
Science never weeps - for the life beneath the microscope.
We are the human ameebae that helplessly float
in a final solution - suspend in hope.

Let me show you something hideous,
insidious, creeping and libidinous.
The worst laid plans of men with mice,
wielding scaples - laboratory sacrifice.

Great for the economy - destroying our ecology.
Unscrupulous, malicious - yet chemically delicious.

Science never sleeps - so I'm singing it a lullabye,
of wolves in sheeps clothing - devils in disguise,
and lab-coats draped over big black lies.
Science never weeps - for the life beneath the microscope.
We are the human ameebae that helplessly float
in a final solution - suspend in hope.

Will we shiver in dark centuries of cryogenic winter,
or be vapourized to ashes when atoms start to splinter?
A case of heads or tails - it's their coin so they can choose,
breed creatures born with two of either so they cannot lose.

We've made tommorows world - a Nirvana for the damned.
We've made tommorows world - Mother Earth on Fatherland?
We've made tommorows world - we're the cause and the effect.
We've made tommorows world - could George Orwell be correct?

Science never sleeps - so I'm singing it a lullabye,
of wolves in sheeps clothing - devils in disguise,
and lab-coats draped over big black lies.
Science never weeps - for the life beneath the microscope.
We are the human ameebae that helplessly float
in a final solution - suspend in hope.
