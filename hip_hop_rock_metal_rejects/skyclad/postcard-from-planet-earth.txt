for absent friends

Sorry it has been so long since you received my last transmission,
meanwhile I've studied them - learned about their strange condition.
Now I think I understand why they live in such confusion,
sadly they'll never change - I have come to this conclusion....

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
but you wouldn't want to live there.

I am the mariner who navigates seas celestial,
astronaut ambassador sent to foreign shores terrestrial.
Now with hindsight I admit I don't admire the humans' lot,
frial bodies - ill equipped, their lives are hard but they are not.

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
but you wouldn't want to live there.

And when you know the ways of men
then you can only pity them,
every day a raging storm -
castaway in a carbon based life form.

I've wandered far I've wondered hard and have one source of comfort only -
when I share my thoughts with you mortality is not so lonely.
Countless starts between us - myriad the things I miss,
I say farewell and think of home, the static drowns my parting kiss.

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
but you wouldn't want to live there.

And as your signal slowly wanes -
the fears return my growing pains,
here it is for what it's worth -
yet another postcard from planet Earth.

Now with hindsight I admit I don't admire the humans' lot,
frial bodies - ill equipped, their lives are hard but they are not.

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
but you wouldn't want to live there.

And when you know the ways of men
then you can only pity them,
every day a raging storm -
castaway in a carbon based life form.

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
but you wouldn't want to live there.
