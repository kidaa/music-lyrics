Just a blank expression sitting in an easy chair
The living incarnation of a world that doesn't care
Mesmerized by media lies
Now they're "New and Improved" by a cunning disguise
It drinks their poisoned water
And thrives off noxious air.

The avant garde of apathy
Waits on the front line
Ever so patiently just biding its' time
They're an advertisers dream
With a greed habit
Their only fear is the fear
Of a green planet.The avant garde of apathy
Looks after itself
Long past its sell by date
you're still preserved on the shelf
They'd rather ruin the world
Than let their children have it
Their only fear is fear of a green planet.
The avant garde of apathy
Vegetates undefeated
But if you don't want to join it
Then you're helping to beat it
Don't let the chance pass you by
You've got to reach out and grab it
Turn this world they have made
Into a green planet.
