Lyrics: Martin Walkyier
Music: Steve Ramsey

It's revelation reveals -
divine comedy and more,
please welcome your four hosts -
death, famine, pestilence and war.

You say that we are all Gods' children, can you please explain -
how any father could inflict his children so much pain.
I'm sure he finds it funny - but I fail to see the joke,
I bet he'll piss his breeches when we all go up in smoke.

Life's one big disaster, I hear the sound of laughter coming from the hereafter, I find it kind of odd
we're stooges for Jehova, he loves to knock us over - so if I die laughing it'll be an act of God!

Thunderbolts were once his style
It's now malignant tumours,
I wonder what he'll think of next
to test my sense of humour?

You said I must accept his will - that God will spare the weak,
I bet those tears aren't tears of laughter running down your cheeck -
when you are stood right there beside me egg upon your face,
your precious soul floats with the dust back home in outer space.
