You came, you saw, you conquered as a woman of your word.
so to say farewell like Judas is a thing i find absurd.
You shook my world - you sucked me in then spat me out in bubbles,
the effects of your affections stay the cause of all my troubles.

CHORUS:
The only thing you never did was have the decency
to kiss this corpse and nail the lid - came on and bury me!

I placed you on the pedestral - you tossed me in the gutter
it seems your lies were like those thighs - spread easier than butter
I'm first to go, so last to know how fickle is your passion
now my bones hang in your closet though my face is out of fashion

CHORUS:
As vultures circle round my head, far as the eye can see,
I walk this world the living dead - high-time to bury me !


You laid me to death - now lay me to rest
a sticky sweet-nothing to get off your chest
It's all pillow-talk at the end of the day
the cat's got your tongue - with so much left to say

I'm not the knave you 've fooled - behind the mask you wore
my beguiling, smiling virgin hides the cunning of a whore
Cause your ego needs an offering - 'tis i the coffin fits
so I martyred like St.Edmund with your name upon my lips

CHORUS:
"Oh, do it hurt ?"
Oh'boes it not! - I died with each degree
just one small detail overlooked - the need to bury me !

I 'm just the shade of something you remembered to forget
stood like Banquo by your bedside - you just haven't seen me yet
Every notch upon the headboard - each twist in your string of lovers
is a tear on your pillow - fate serves you as serves the others !

CHORUS:
"You swore to always stay my friend - why even this can't be
Kept your back turned until the end whilst i begged ; Bury me !"
