"Though I may seem callous" cried old Thomas Malthus,
"Paupers are better off dead.
That we have to feed them is something we need
Like a musket shot straight through the head."
Not much of a smiler - our man Wat Tyler
Died for the working man's fight.
Was daring such a treason a justified reason
For ending his days with his head on a spike?

In order to see pearly factory gates -
We all learn our places pre-destined fates.
God fearing people with minimal goals,
Led to the slaughter - "tools with souls".

Save us from hellfire -
Save us from dancing the Brimstone Ballet.

When the church and its leaders sought new ways to bleed us -
It didn't take them long to find,
Fear of perdition beats nuclear
Fission at making the mill-wheels grind.
Ban contraception - a shrewd move says I
Plenty of slaves born to suffer and die.
Say "Go forth and multiply" when you want more.
When you've too many just send them to war.

History's wounds will not heal overnight -
They pray for my soul as they set me alight.
Remember the maxim "Arbeit Macht Frei" -
Thought up by a christian with God on his side...

It's a hell made by christians with God on their side.

The work goes on in babylon -
Enslaving us from birth,
With promises of paradise -
They've made a hell on earth.

Save us from hellfire -
Save us from dancing the Brimstone Ballet.

Well I think that Satan was God's best creation -
He's kept him in business for years.
It's not common sense making mankind repent -
But eternal damnation it fears.
They're not slow to realise - they know every trick.
Drive human donkeys with God on a stick.
Tom Torquemada - he sings like a dream,
Lucrecia Borgia plays lead tambourine.

In order to see pearly factory gates -
We all learn our places pre-destined fates.
God fearing people with minimal goals,
Led to the slaughter - "tools with souls!"

Save us from hellfire -
Save us from dancing the Brimstone Ballet.
