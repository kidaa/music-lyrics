Silently gazing from the window -
My mind detached from space and time.
There is a secret only I know -
A place where the city lights don't shine.

Why don't you come up here with me?
Let Aphrodite take you by the hand,
And we can tell the future how it should be
When we set sail for Alexander's land.

A stranger in the garden 'neath a full moon in the sky,
This is the Old God's country -
You can bring me here to die.
It's a thinking mans Valhalla -
A long weekend in paradise,
Package tour to Eden -
My spirit yearns for freedom.So leave your troubles far behind you -
Take care not to pack them in your case.
Your jaded spirits lifted - your body born anew,
The minute golden sunlight hits your face.
I'll fly as high as any eagle -
Watch me now I soar above the sand.
I get the strangest sense of deja vu
When I set foot on Alexander's land.

A stranger in the garden 'neath a full moon in the sky
This is the Old God's country -
You can bring me here to die.
It's a thinking mans Valhalla -
A long weekend in paradise,
Package tour to eden -
My spirit yearns for freedom.

Is it reality - is it a dream?
Strangely intangible - somewhere between,
Frankly absurd and naively serene.
My search goes on....
