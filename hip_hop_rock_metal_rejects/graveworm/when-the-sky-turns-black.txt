Eyes of pain - eyes of death
Death has come - life is gone
Humanity in the sphere of death
The world falls down...
When the sky turns black
When the sky turns black - black
Desperate cry in the infinity of life
The world destroyed by humynity itself
Life ended as the world falls down
The death is the door of life
God forgot their mistakes of life
The nature burn in time
Heaven fall silent down
The world went black when the war...
Death is the way
You find the life
Your mind will die
And you will cry
Your god shout down
The punish of time
The angel of death
Will now become
Seeing days like the time of eternal night
The world burns now the end of life has come for me
Insanity, infinity in this life of pain
Flames of sorrow deepest hate destroyed the life
Stand alone in the night
Sorrow in your mind
Tears in your eyes
Destroy your inner faith
Faces of death before your mind
Insanity for all the time
God will cry for your soul
Your heart is seeing black
Heaven of love is waiting you
Let us fly to the sky
End of life for every soul
