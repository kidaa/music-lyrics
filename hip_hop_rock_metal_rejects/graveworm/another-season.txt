Striking over the sea
Where the night's eyes reign
Lightning awakes the sky
From the shadows of the night
Stroming rain from deepest skies
Dreaming moon in the dark
Moonchild cries about the world
Ending the breath of life
Another season gone
Another season come
Fall into the deepset dark
To end the age of godless faith
Fall into eternal sleep
Waiting there for your destiny
Waiting for death is all that remains
When the sky falls down with all their fear
The burning flames that rise will be
My endless pain on my way
Tears in my eyes - reflecting the shining...
Blood in my eyes - depicting the bleeding
Pain in my eyes - showing the fighting
In the cold winds of nowhere
Deep inside the dying woods
My destiny became reality
When the darkest shadow rules the world
Silent time once so full of love
Condemned to be - forgotten time
Fall into the deepest dark
To end the age of godless faith
Fall into eternal sleep
Waiting there for your destiny
Waiting for death is all that remain
When the sky falls down with all their fear
The burning flames that rise will be
My endless pain before my way
Tears in my eyes reflecting the shining
Blood in my eyes depicting the bleeding
Pain in my eyes showing the fighting
Another season gone
Another season I will find
