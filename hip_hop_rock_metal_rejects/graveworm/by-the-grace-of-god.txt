However one day
Black shadows darkened the light
Destruction of harmony
The horsemen began the sentenced
In the name of god
A battle against godless tribe
A dreadful pact
Lost a thousand innocent souls
A sea of blood was the price
What they must pay for their life
Swords of steal and crys of pain
The silence destroyed once again
No one reason, gave them the right
Fighting a defencless tribe
So they created a misantropic kingdom
Created from a see of dmide
Weeping children died by holy hands
Summoned in the name of jesus christ
Blood fillded heavens lie above destruction
A Shallow faith formed into hate
Die - by the grace of god
Destroyed by their hate
Die - by the grace of god
The mistakes of life
As they ride the hill
To the holy land
A thousand people die
As the angels cry
