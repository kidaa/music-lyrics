Dying I scream for life
But your eyes are sleeping forever now
Wondering what's to come
I remember the light of your life
Silence shadows of life
Sleep into eternal time
Darkness revenge on earth
My tears are falling above the face
I saw the fallen angel
Kreeping from time to time
Awake jesus christ - the world must survive
A light in front of me appears
I am at the door of fear
Gone is the day and so the time
The light goes off before I cry
Awake Jesus Christ - I saw the hope
Crying the time has come
To destroy the faith on this earth
Jesus christ welcome to be
The saver of this faithless life
Destroying the darkest night
Before the sun will rise for light
Saving nature's life
The sea of blood must stoping now
I saw the fallen angel - die
