As I saw the world in flames
Through the eyes of eternal life
I wish to destroy the life
For every innocent child cry
As a sign to die
As I see the mistakes of man
I feel my anger
God will make the end of time
You cry forever
I cry - I saw
Eternal, eternal winds
Eternal, eternal winds
Eternal, eternal winds
Eternal, eternal winds
Your voice screams like
The rain from sky
The end of time has come
Neither time nor a sign
Can stop this circle of death
Lost in yourself there's no way to get out
The world is burning bright
Nothingness before the end
Unreality of fear
A prophecy
Is on the sky
Obscurity
Over the world
I cry - I saw
Eternal, eternal winds
Eternal, eternal winds
Eternal, eternal winds
Eternal, eternal winds
An image of total devastation
Characterize the world of today
