In the land where the angels fly
and the throne af heaven lies
hear the distant echos - enchanted songs
Far away in the distant sky
I see a flame that burns in the night
in the silent of the endless time - I'll ride
A howling wind across the sea
turning blavk the sky and the light
creature of the night - hear them cry
As the wolwes howls to the night
the ruins glow in the dark
to the twilightland arrive
I sailed the darkened way
and another age has come
the birth of a new dawn
alone in the forest of shadows
without one path to go
I was left alone
at the path of my faith
struggling against the wind
walking through deep snow
a silent snow in your head
therefore you must die
A lightning strikes from the darkenes sky
a bloodred sign appears in the night
the evil has arrived - the raven flies
Surrounded by the screamings of pain
the ancient demon of forgotten realm
the nights of incubus - seducted by the dark
Soon to be entombed in the soil
swept away by the mortalide
the demon has arrived - arise from the sleep
The secrets behind the black endless void
fearfull thoughts with hate in his eyes
arrives from the darkened sky
Born again in twilight myth
with wings siled in blood
again his wrath shall rule
the genesis of death
rising up from the flames
And fight for revenge
