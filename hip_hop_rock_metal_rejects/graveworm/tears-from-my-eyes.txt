Visions of a future that you will never see
Memories of the past
Traces of grief that you must survive
Only to feel pain again
Desolation of man is what I see now
Confusion is all around
Darkness is falling before my eyes
Losing my last hope
Tears from my eyes
Filled with dreams
Tears from my eyes
For a dying world
Suffer day and night
Slowly this world will fade away
The life decrease, my tears unseen
No one try to fear
You'll have to go through the time
To find the truth
You stare into the depth and try...
The answer disappears
Mindless thoughts before you die
Slowly you cry to leave
Inside my eyes the world cries loud
The time has come to die
Tears from my eyes
Filled with dreams
Tears from my eyes
For a dying world
I cry
