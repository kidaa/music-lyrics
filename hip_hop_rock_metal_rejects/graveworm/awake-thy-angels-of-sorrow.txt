Dying I scream for life
But your eyes are sleeping forever now
Silence, shadows of life
Sleep into eternal time
Darkness revenge on earth
My tears are falling
I saw the fallen angel
Creeping from time to time
Da-nay-but nox-mey-d-um se-li Spa-t-um
Rubro-obi Cocco tincta Soper Lectos
Canderet vestis ebernos multa
The time has come
Destroying
The darkest night
Before the sun will rise for light
The sea of blood must stoping now
I saw the fallen angel - die
