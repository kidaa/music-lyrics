The mountains below
The flames of your soul are burning still
The sky turned black
Storms of rain infesting life
Moonlight vanishes
Darkness shadows rule the world
Coldest breeze
Frozen winds blown through the sky
All light is gone
Hopeless time
Daylight's shine
Far away
The monument of the past
Abyss with pain and lies
Distant crying witless life
Black horizons eternal night's
Tragedy withering flowers
Darkening in my eyes
Shining light
Gates to sky showing life
Beautiful silence
Tranquillity I have found
Agony
Was no more and so was pain
Forgotten hope
In the air and my eyes
The open sky filled with light
Heaven's love come to the world
Withering flowers swept away
Blooming trees in their place
Sunshine fades now away
Return deep coldest age
Far away see the light of the life
Far away see the light of the life
