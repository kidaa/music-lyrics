i got a lie 
a fat fuckin' lie 
about a law 
idiots obey 
they made it easy
now cheaters have their way 
you hi-di-ho's 
you're living on your knees
forget the rule! 
oh - idiots rule! 
forget the rule! 
oh - idiots rule!
now there's a time... 
but i say non like now 
there's a time 
where idiots are bound 
if there's a pole 
planted in your back 
then you're a fixture
not a man 
forget the rule! 
oh - idiots rule! 
forget the rule! 
oh - idiots rule!
idiots! 
idiots rule! 
idiots! 
idiots rule! 
idiots! 
idiots rule!
you know that man 
you hate? 
you look more like him 
every day everyday
hi-di-hos! 
2 good shoes 
won't save your soul 
idiots rule! 
idiots rule!
