Hey, you don't know me! 
You don't know me but you just keep on looking at me down low. 
Oh no! 
Digging something up... 
Digging something up...
Always digging something up... 
Oh no! 
Hey you! 
I don't know you. 
I don't even want to, but you just keep looking at me down low. 
Oh no! 
Digging something up... 
Digging something up... 
Always digging something up...
Oh no! 
And you make it so *#... 
Make it so obvious... 
Hey you! Fools don't fit in the boots that I tread in, 
but you just keep on looking at me down low. 
Oh no! 
Digging something up... 
Digging something up... 
Always digging something up... 
Oh no! 
And you make it so *#... but do you get it? 
Make it so *#... you never get it. 
You got to owe me something 
before you know what is joke and what is up. 
I worked my fingers to the bone and I won't let you stop me going up. 
Why do you have to make it so!-so!-so!-so!-so!
OBVIOUS!? Oh no! Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...
