What makes a kettle whistle?
What makes gold precious?
How come some people,
They'll show you everything?
How come some people,
They don't like nothing at all?
Well I know why...
We all want to be...
Beautiful too...
Beautiful too...
What makes a baby cry?
What makes a poor baby
Older than a rich one?
And why do we need to belong,
To someone else?
Well I know why...
We all want to be...
Beautiful too...
Beautiful too...
