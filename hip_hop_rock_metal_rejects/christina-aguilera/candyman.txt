Candy man, candy man...

Sweet sugar candy man [whispered]

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop jive, makes my panties drop
He's a swinging rockin sugar coated candy man
A sweet rockin sugar coated candy man

Ooo yeah..

He took me to this cotton club on Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
?

He's a one stop job, make my cherry pop
He's a sweet rockin sugar coated candy man
A sweet rockin sugar coated candy man
