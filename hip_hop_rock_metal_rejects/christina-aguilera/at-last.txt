At last
my love has come along
my lonely days over
and life is like a song

At last
the skies above are blue
well my heart was wrapped up in clover
the night I looked at you I found a dream
that I could speak to
a dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
a thrill that I have never known well

You smile
you smile
oh and then the spell was cast
and here we are in heaven
for you are mine at last
I found a dreamthat I could speak to
a dream that Icould call my own
I found a thrillto press my cheek to
a thrill that I have never known
well

You smile
you smile
oh and then the spell was cast
and here we are in heaven
for you are mine at last
ooo yea
you are mine
you are mine
at last
at last
at last
at last
