He-hey he-hey ohh
Oh yeah
Well alright
He-hey

What is this feeling coming over me?
I'm taken back in disbelief
Is this really me, ha! in the mirror I see?
Staring back at me:
Could it be? A new reflection of a woman complete

All of a sudden I'm so care-free well alright
'cause love is doing something strange to me well alright
Got a new flame, ha! haven't been the same
Something in me's changed, rearranged
And I feel that I've been saved

You got me feeling like you're that something I've been missing
Everything's heaven 'cause life with you has been a blessing

Oh-oh oh-oh
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah
Oh-oh oh-oh
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah
Who knew? Who knew?
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray
Yeah-hey

I've kept some company I shouldn't have well alright
Made some mistakes but that's in the past well alright
I'm professing here to you
Proof that I am through

I'm coming clean
Now I can breathe
and I finally believe, yeah

You got me thinking I'll be alright, and you're the reason
Ooh I can feel it, we're moving in a new direction

Oh-oh oh-oh
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah
Oh-oh oh-oh
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah
Who knew? Who knew?
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray

Ohh
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you by my side
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you standing by

Makes me wanna pray
Makes me need to pray
When I'm feeling low and all alone,
You're the light in my day, yeah

Oh-oh oh-oh
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah
Oh-oh oh-oh
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah
Who knew? Who knew?
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
'cause it makes me wanna get down and pray
'cause it makes me wanna get down and pray
Makes me wanna get down and pray

Woo, thank you father!

Wanna lift my hands up and pray
'cause everytime I'm hearing your name
Wanna reach out and rejoice
Sound of your voice, yeah

Hey yeah
