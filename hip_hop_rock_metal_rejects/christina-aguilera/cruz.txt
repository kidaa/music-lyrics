I'm leaving today
Living it, leaving it to change

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied, twisted are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags finally on the move

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, leaving it to change

As I'm driving I'm captured by the view
Of so much beauty, the road becomes my muse
The heat is rising and my head soars through the wind
Cool, calm, collective is a child that lost a thing

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I'm missing
I think I really miss it 

Don't walk away 
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams
I'm free, finally free

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, leaving it to change
See I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
I'm leaving today I'm leaving it to change
Living it, I'm leaving it to change

Living it, leaving it
Said I'm living it, leaving it
Living it, leaving it to change 
I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I miss it
I think I really miss it 
One day
