Get on up and feel the groove
Let the music take control
And let your body move
Just get lost into the sound
Once the music takes you
You will finally have found
It will take, you away
To another state of mind
Where peace you'll find inside the sound, oh
Just escape, to a place
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away

To another state of mind
Where peace you'll find inside the sound
Just escape, to a place
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away
