Oh, ooh
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Oh, sleep in heavenly peace 
Ooh ooh, ohh

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia, yeah
Christ the Savior is born
Ooh, Christ the Savior is born, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Noche de paz, noche de amor
Todo duerme en derredor
Entre los astros que esparcen su luz
Bella anunciando al nio Jess
Brilla la estrella de paz
Oh, brilla la estrella de paz

Oh ooh, oh, oh
Christ the Savior is born
Oh Christ the Savior is born
