I can't believe what you did to me
Down on my knees and I need to break free
All these years, you violated me

I don't know why I can't feel inside
Trying to hide, can't make it all right
It's overkill, now I'm ready to fight ready to fight

I don't need nobody trying to make me over make me over 
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day

Feeling confined, like I'm being forced in
My vision's blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overload, and I'm out of control out of control

So sick and tired of feeling so misused feeling so misused
Taking me down with all your mental abuse
I must say, gotta get you out of my head

Everybody's always trying to look me over look me over
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

Leaving the house another quarter to five
Slipped on my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high, I feel so alive

Let down my hair, feel the wind on my skin wind on my skin
Crossing the water where my new life begins
And I close my eyes and take it all in

I don't need nobody trying to make me over make me over 
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
