Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, ooh yeah

Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth, oh yeah
Now long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
The power, and the glory
For ever and ever
Amen

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine, ooh
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night

Oh, yeah, yeah
*laughs
Oh yeah
No oh, oh yeah

Oh ooh, oh ooh
Now ooh, oh ooh
Oh yeah

It was a holy, holy night
Ohh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh holy night
It was a holy night when Jesus Christ was born
Oh holy night
Holy Jesus, Jesus Christ
Oh holy night
And the power, and the glory, yeah
Oh holy night
When Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ
Oh holy night
He was born on this night, on this night
Oh holy night
Jesus Christ
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
Oh holy night...
