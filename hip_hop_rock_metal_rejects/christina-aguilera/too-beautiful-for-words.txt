[Verse 1]

When I try to describe how I feel when you hold me
I get butterflies lullabies, it's hard to explain
Like the sent of a rose or the sound of the rain
It's too precious and too wonderful to give it a name

[Chorus]

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words 
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

[Verse 2]

It's on the tip of my tongue
But my lips are still sealed
Only violins and their innocence can show you how I feel
And I hear them again
At the end of the day
I'm all teary-eyed when we kiss good-bye
There's nothing I can say

[Chorus]

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside of me
Too beautiful for words
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

[Verse 3]

Must be a million times 
I've tried to express this love of mine 
When it goes this deep, when it tastes this sweet
It's not easy to define

[Chorus]

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart
