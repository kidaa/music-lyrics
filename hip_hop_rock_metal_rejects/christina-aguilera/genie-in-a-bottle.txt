I feel like I've been locked up tight
for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips
And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby. Baby. baby Baby ,baby, baby

[Bridge:]
Ooh my body is saying let's go
Ooh but my heart is saying no

[Chorus:]
If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading
The lights down low
Just one more dance
And then were gonna go
Waiting for someone
Who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby

[Bridge:]
Ooh my body is saying let's go
Ooh but my heart is saying no

[Chorus:]
If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me Ooh
I can make your wish come true 
Wish come true...Woah
Just come and set me free
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You Gotta rub me the right way honey
if you wanna be with me
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

[Bridge:]
Ooh my body is saying let's go
Ooh but my heart is saying no

[Chorus:]
If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true Ooh
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do Oh Yeah

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come, on and let me out
