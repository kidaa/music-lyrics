Can you feel me
Do that shit do that shit do it
Do that shit do that shit do it

Ooh yeah
On the dance floor
Yeah yeah yeah
Lets play a game
On the dance floor
Oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Lets play a game
Lets pretend for a second
You dont know who I am or what I do
Lets just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating
I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes
Trying to see into your mind
See into your soul
See, no limits to the levels
Me and you can go
When its me, I take control
But its something about you
That makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing
And the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it
Not saying a thing
The way you got me going
Got me going outta brains
I see us going at it
Going in and out of them lanes

I dont want your innocence
I dont want you to stutter
I dont want a commitment
I dont want you to suffer
I dont want your number
Baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up
Looking like something you wanna

[Christina Aguilera:]
Tell me, what you thinking about
When you got me waitng patiently
And usually, I dont have to wait for nobody
But theres something about you
That really got me feeling weak
And Im trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I dont even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
Im hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know youre gonna like it I know
So tell me how you want it Tell me
And you dont have to fight it You dont
Cause baby youre invited Baby
I know youre gonna like it I know
So tell me how you want it Tell me
And you dont have to fight it You dont
Cause baby youre invited Baby

[Diddy:]
Youre dreams fullfilled
Youre rockin with the best
 put your limits to the test
Youre pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
Youre hyperventilating, trying to catch your breath
Dont stop
Im the first, Im the next, Im the end
Im the boss, in your thoughts, thatll make your mind bend
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you
The  every move, now I know you
I dont wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me
Dont stop
Im the dream, Im the one, Im the reason you come
Im a king, Im a hung, Im a beast
Im the last thing your eyes see
The passions inside me, its yours
Now come try me, cmon

[Christina Aguilera:]
Tell me, what you thinking about
When your hands is all on me
Cause Ive been thinking about
All the possibilities
Aint no other place that I really wanna be
Cause youre sweepin me off my feet

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I dont even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
Im hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I got a selection of the positions of affection
With no pressure
So tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe

With no pressure
So tell me
Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it babe
