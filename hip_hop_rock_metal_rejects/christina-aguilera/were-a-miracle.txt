Here we are, safe at last 
We can breath a sigh, seems the storm has passed 
All our friends would ask us why with all that stood between us 
Why did we even try no one know, imagined we could make it 
But it only made us glad, we both believed... ooh... 

You and me, we're a miracle; meant to be 
And nothing can change it 
Mountains move 
And oceans part 
When they are standing in our way 
You and me, we're a mircale; 
Angels stand watching over 
And heaven shines upon us, everyday 

All my life, I felt incomplete 
But you turned my soul, with your love so sweetly 
You hear my thoughts, you read my mind 
You're the part of me, I thought I'd never find 
No one I know can make me feel like ou do 
Hold me and I feel like I can fly... 

You and me, we're a miracle; meant to be 
And nothing can change it 
Mountains move 
And oceans part 
When they are standing in our way 
You and me, we're a mircale; 
Angels stand watching over 
And heaven shines upon us, everyday 

The chance was so unlikely 
That we would ever win 
Two stars above the heavens 
Destiny brought you to me 

You and me, we're a miracle; meant to be 
And nothing can change it 
Mountains move 
And oceans part 
When they are standing in our way 
You and me, we're a mircale; 
Angels stand watching over 
And heaven shines upon us, everyday
