Hey...yeah yeah

Do your thing honey

I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something 'bout you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside

I don't know what you did boy but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

Told my mother, my brother
My sister and my friends
Told the others others, my lovers lovers
Both past and present tense alright
That every time I see you
Everything starts making sense

Do your thing honey

CHORUS:
Ain't no other man
That can stand, up next to you
Ain't no other man
On the planet, does what you do what you do
You're the kinda guy
A girl finds, in a blue moon hey
You got soul yeah, you got class ooh
You got style, with your badass oh yeah
Ain't no other man it's true alright
Ain't no other man but you[/color]

Never thought I'd be alright no no no
Till you came and changed my life yeah yeah yeah
What was cloudy now is clear, yeah yeah
You're the light that I needed, uh

You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on giving it up

Tell your mother mother, your brother brother
Your sister and your friends your sister and your friends
Tell the others others, your lovers lovers
Better not be present tense mmhmm
'Cause I want everyone to know
That you are mine and no one else's, ohh, oh OOH!

CHORUS:#

Break it down now

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't, no other, other
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't, no other lover oh ooh
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you, ohh

You are there when I'm a mess
Talk me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy you're the best
You're the only one who's ever
Passed every teeeeest...!!!

CHORUS:#

And now I'm telling you
Said ain't no other man but you, ohh...yeah, yeah yeah, haha
