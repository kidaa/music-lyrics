No one ever said that
Love was gonna be easy 
Gotta take the ups and downs
The in-betweens 
If you take this journey
Gotta give yourself completely 
Never let nobody ever step on a dream 

You better stop 
Listen to these words I say 
You better stop 
Don't you throw this good thing away
no no 
Put your trust in me 
And I'll make you see 

[CHORUS:]
No the rain wont last forever 
Find a way to make it better 
Long as we can stand together 
Love will find a way 
Gonna make a new tomorrow 
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow 
Better listen when I say 
Love will find a way 

Somebody tried to tell me love
don't last forever 
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams 
After all is said and done
We're still here together 
Never listen to the lies and jealousy 

You better stop 
Don't you let them turn you around 
You better stop 
Hang onto this love that we've found 
Nothing that they say 
Can stand in our way 

[Chorus]

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it baby

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it baby

Try
Listen to these words
That I say
Try
Don't you throw
This good thing away
No
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see

[Chorus 2X]
I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it 

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it 

[Repeat Chorus To Fade]
