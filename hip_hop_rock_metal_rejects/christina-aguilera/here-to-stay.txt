Hey yeah yeah, whoa yeah, whoa oh yeah

Well everybody got an opinion now, don't they
But it aint no thang to me
it really don't make any difference now to me
if you don't like what you see
I pay no mind to the negative kind
cause it's just no way to be
i don't stop to please someone else you see
Gonna live my life for me

I'm gonna get bold, gonna do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing
and no matter what people say, or might think
I aint going no place, no I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
And I aint going no place, no I'm here to stay

I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay
I've never been the type to be...
