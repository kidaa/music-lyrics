little mirror on the wall forgive my sins as so many times before 
your calm convinced the world I know is beyond your reach 
your eyes too numb to see and even though you pretend to search 
you never shed a tear 
you'll see me shine and roll with the wind again 
silence couldn't deal with your alibis 
disclosure of heavens gate 
I have seen getsemane in your eyes 
you consumed my flesh and blood 
you took my soul so easily 
but it's hard to even crawl when chasing for reality 
you came to me like a judas' kiss 
yet I am bound to trust you and only 
I could have quenched your thirst 
refreshed your soul anew 
you'll see me shine and roll with the wind again 
silence couldn't deal with your alibis 
disclosure of heavens gate 
I have seen getsemane in your eyes 
you will deny me again forever 
as long as I'm bound to be here 
softly caressing the pain 
learning we all have a cross to bear 
we all have a reason to die 
a reason to leave all the worries and fly
