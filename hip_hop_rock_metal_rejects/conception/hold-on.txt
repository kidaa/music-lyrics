ostby, khantatat, nagell-dahl
don't try to seize the time we shared 
for all I ever do I do for you just close your eyes and say you care for all we ever knew 
I know its true 
and I will teach you how to laugh and cry 
the world succumb to our pride to our pride 
won't you hold on 
and we'll be forgiven 
just you hold on 
I'll always be there for you 
I know my thoughts are far away 
but all I ever do I do for you 
one gentle touch is worth the pain 
and all we ever knew I know it's true 
and I will teach you how to love me 
in my dreams you're still in my embrace my embrace 
won't you hold on 
and we'll be forgiven 
just you hold on 
I'll always be there for you 
I can see you 
when I close my eyes 
when I'm all alone 
when I'm all alone 
and I wish that 
you could hold my hand for a little while 
for a little while
