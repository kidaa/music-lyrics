sometimes it's easy to believe 
it's worth the pain sometimes 
you wonder if your efforts were all in vain 
you talk to shadows on the wall 
you try so hard to understand 
how all the little lies and lectures can contradict 
you`ve lost the sense 
flow into your mind 
embracing like a mother's womb 
flow and you will find 
forgotten pictures of the moon 
you think the world is all dependent on your good will 
and you believe there's always someone right behind you 
to pay the bill 
a pretty face is not enough to conquer anything at all 
a money mountain couldn't save you 
you slide your back against the wall 
flow into your mind embracing like a mother's womb 
flow and you will find forgotten pictures of the moon 
the pretty face you always trusted will turn around and speak to you 
and you will realise too late 
you're someone that you never knew
