music: Ostby, Heimdal, Amlien / lyrics: Khan
clinch onto the swirling wind 
have a glimpse of ancient sins 
taste a ray of amber light as the weary sun goes down 
there is yet another shore 
luna's light won't leave you anymore 
closing in closing in a whisper in the rain; 
no-one knows your name 
you've heard that voice before 
some wounds may never heal the ways of grace are narrow  
some secrets can't be sealed and in your head the battle rages on 
someone said; you'd never learn 
strange how people tend to yearn long for insecurity 
you fought to prove them wrong you grew older, 
pages turned some were right, 
you never really learned fast decisions made your way 
too proud to quit the game 
but now they know your name be hailed for what you earned 
some wounds may never heal the light confines the shadows 
some secrets can't be sealed but no-one cares about the tears you cry 
men died for your belief men 
that never knew you wouldn't even try remember 
responsibility for those who couldn't tell the enemy from defender
