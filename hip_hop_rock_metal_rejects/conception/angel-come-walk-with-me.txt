it's only me my friend 
your private lucifer 
an angel heaven sent down to your deepest fears 
walk with me 
talk to me again 
in your sleep 
when you're weak astray 
I feel you right inside me 
nothing can be right if there is no wrong 
all around me 
innocent replies from a twisted tongue 
I am the golden calf 
providing hate and greed 
I am the other half 
maintaining harmony 
silently violently 
but pure in your sleep 
when you're insecure 
I feel you right inside me 
love cannot be real if you cannot hate 
all around me 
pain is only pleasure in a different shape 
I feel you right inside me 
how can there be heaven if there is no hell 
all around me 
nothing can remain if it's all too well 
I feel you right inside me 
beauty has no meaning if without the beast 
all around me
