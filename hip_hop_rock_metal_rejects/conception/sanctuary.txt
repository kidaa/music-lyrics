music: Ostby, Khan / lyrics: Khan
blind eyes search the sky 
but try not to reveal uncertainty 
behind images dancing on a wall 
each tear a vision 
the more you cry you'll learn 
it's so easy to hide in the dark 
the song you know so well 
encourages to flee the answer to your tears 
lingers in colours you can't see 
each word a whisper 
the more they say you'll find 
it's so easy to hide in the dark 
you won't find the treasure below the rainbows end 
black and white are strangers to the pictures of the rain 
you meet another day 
with hasty little lies 
when someone laughs you turn away 
glad people make you feel unsafe 
there's a place where all is sound 
where you know you won't be found 
where the sun and the moon never shine 
and it's easy to hide in the dark
