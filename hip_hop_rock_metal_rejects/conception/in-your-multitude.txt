music: Ostby / lyrics: Khan
another day reaches for life 
and when I see you're not there 
I hush the sunrise nails in my tired head 
wide awake wide awake remember 
all how you laughed when you were near things 
we never knew the dreams that we shared 
now I miss your warm embrace 
once in my life I could have had it all 
someone turn back turn back the time 
I'd change tomorrow tomorrow 
once in my life I should have cried your name 
someone turn back the time 
I know what went wrong 
and I reach out for life 
try to catch that moment 
now I remember the outline of her face 
I know the pain she must have felt 
when I came too close 
when she was close to me 
when the stars would summon the angels 
once in my life I could have had it all 
someone turn back 
turn back the time 
I'd change tomorrow 
tomorrow once in my life 
I should have cried your name 
someone turn back the time 
I know what went wrong 
how I wish that you were here to fulfill the dreams 
we never dared help me make it through 
when the winter night is clear I see stars, 
adore their multitude 
they shine for you and I
