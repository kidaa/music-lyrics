music:Ostby, Heimdal, Amlien / lyrics:Khan
a fading photo on a wooden shelf 
sneering in your face 
unlike the memory of the little boy 
from what you call "the good old days" 
the bitter taste of fall the smell of wet concrete walls 
and still you count the cries at night you try to analyse 
the solar serpent shines 
reforms the shadows of the past 
and evermore the torment lasts 
the solar serpent shines 
you traced the contours of a union 
where only greed survives 
convicted by the mass 
you kept your course 
with head held high the victims at your feet 
the mission must proceed 
there is a higher cause 
you said afraid to understand 
the solar serpent shines 
reforms the shadows of the past 
eternally the cross will burn 
the solar serpent shines 
alone again 
but yet not quite so sure 
watch it coming
