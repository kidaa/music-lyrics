ostby,khantatat
you cast a carmine kiss 
across the digits into my lonely life 
I felt a certain bliss 
I tried to save it to keep the rush alive 
holy holy but so unreal 
slowly slowly my circuit heart corrodes 
I'd die to meet you in the flesh 
somehow recover the pain 
I want to touch and be caressed 
to breathe and live again 
I see you all around 
cyberian venus destined to chastity 
but I am also bound to trust my senses 
redeem humanity 
haunt me hate me unchain your soul 
taunt me waste me forsake, consolidate 
I'd die to meet you in the flesh 
somehow recover the pain 
I want to touch and be caressed
