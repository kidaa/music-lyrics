no-one knows what lies behind my stare 
my eyes do not reflect 
and no-one knows the dreams I bear 
the world I must protect 
within my soul 
within my soul 
a thousand kings have died 
I wanna know 
I wanna go where horizon touches sky 
tell me 
tell me 
all the lies again 
words to justify 
tell me 
tell me 
that it's worthwile 
to get behind 
the why's were all is true 
I don't care if I should die today 
my history remains you know, 
I never really paid not even half of what I gained 
a little light a second sight is all that I demand 
I wanna fly I wanna die where the ocean meets the sand 
tell me 
tell me 
all the lies again 
words to justify 
tell me 
tell me 
that it's worthwile 
to get behind 
the why's were all is true 
deep within my mind 
it's getting clearer now 
all I rejected remains 
tell me 
tell me 
all the lies again 
words to justify what I must do 
tell me 
tell me 
that it's worthwile 
to get behind
