ostby, khantatat
you are everything 
I would you are found in what I do 
as the moon passes slowly by 
we say our words and then we cry a little bit cause we do belong 
the dark seems so bright tonight 
keep me close keep me warm 
the stars cast a mellow light 
enough for a rose a rose to be born 
who can say if you remain my dear 
who can tell if you will always care 
but you know that I'm around to comfort you 
and play the clown so you can laugh 
cause we do belong 
the dark seems so bright tonight 
keep me close 
keep me warm 
the stars cast a mellow light 
enough for a rose a rose to be born 
cry your tears of joy 
cry a tear for me 
and you and everything we are 
the dark seems so bright tonight 
keep me close 
keep me warm 
the stars cast a mellow light 
enough for a rose a rose to be born
