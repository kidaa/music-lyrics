ostby, khantatat
I could never compromise on all my dreams 
I would never sacrifice my self-esteem 
paint your kiss on someone elses collar 
soak your sorrow with another dollar 
tell me when I'm gone 
"nothing can remain, you know nothing" 
cut the crap shut your mouth 
until it's over fed up with counting 
cheap clichEs 
it's really time you reach your point my dear 
the reptile smile on your tender lips revealing all 
I wanna know 
so keep your little riddles to yourself for heaven's sake 
tell me when I'm gone 
I feel you waste my time 
tell me when I'm gone 
for then it will be fine 
I'll be fine when tomorrow covers me 
"no-one can be tamed, you know, no-one" 
you repeat 
shut your mouth until it's over 
I never asked for anything 
but someone who'd accept the way I am 
I damn the day when you said to me "could you forgive me once again?" 
now I know enough to hate myself for heaven's sake 
tell me when I'm gone 
I feel you waste my time 
tell me when I'm gone 
for then it will be fine 
I'll be fine when tomorrow covers me 
hard to care for what you don't respect 
hard to swallow with a broken neck
