music: Ostby, Heimdal / lyrics: Khan
in cover of a dazzling fullmoon 
I pace in the hall rendered harmless 
by the memory of what I used to be 
night's soon over I dread another sunrise 
the pain of knowing I might have changed the world 
I couldn't pass with a compromise 
but the healing hand belongs to the living 
and I am no longer the world will go on without me 
I'm no longer 
when I leave I'll feel a soft asuagement 
and with minimal manliness 
I'll bow to hail the light 
when night's over 
I'll sink into oblivion 
but still I will remember 
I could have changed the world 
I couldn't pass with a compromise 
'cause the healing hand belongs to the living 
and I am no longer the world 
is the same without me I'm no longer
