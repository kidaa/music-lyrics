music: Ostby / lyrics: Khan
don't hesitate to hope, they said come close, 
don't be afraid love 
don't seem to find it's way to where you stay 
you have to feel the light, 
they said it's easy to forget 
love is really far away 
for a dying of today 
mother mary comfort in a cross of silver 
hard to pick a saviour from a million gods 
'cause when you settle for a new dimension 
you'll never find the one your dying for 
last temptation; touch me before you close your eyes 
die a martyr to your principles 
'cause you're the only god who's visible tonight 
once you have crossed the course 
you seek when your resistance' 
weak when your goal is left behind you 
soon recline eyes of the source 
you're searching for can't see you anymore 
and salvation's far away for a dying led astray 
make another mountain 
move before it's over try to pick a saviour 
if you know his name but mary's crying 
on the edge of heaven deliberation's bad for faith she claims 
last temptation; touch me before you close your eyes 
die a martyr to your principles 
'cause you're the only god who's visible tonight 
they all seem to be the same 
so hard to decide 
when a million gods retain all there is to find 
there's another universe behind each blinding flare 
suddenly they'll all emerge 
but none of them would care
