music: Ostby / lyrics: Khan
I'm a new messiah won't you cry a tear for me 
I absorb your sleepless nights 
I'm a black horizon 
I'm solitude in chains 
always in your way 'cause this is my land 
won't you join my lamentation take your time, 
remember I am just a breath away 
look into my eyes, they're hollow but I see the rising flow 
only pain can cure my sorrow 
nothing compares to the dreams that I know 
can you hear me under the mourning star 
all I dream of all the thoughts 
I must expel 
who would 
who could 
who dares 
who cares 
who would 
trade his soul for my monocracy 
a silver line for me to climb out of the shades 
to find tomorrow the pain 
your master claims I live it every day 
so you are my land 
look into my eyes, they're hollow who's behind, 
they never show I have waited long, 
my fellow nothing compares to the hopes that I've grown 
can you hear me under the mourning star 
all I dream of all the thoughts 
I must expel 
who would 
who could 
who dares 
who cares 
your conception will remain 
dogmas in the breeze 
enclosed by anys pain
