music: Ostby, Khan / lyrics: Khan
I have crossed the ultimate limit today 
a war is half-way won 
time and time again I've said to myself; 
there's a time and place for everyone 
frozen flame subsides in hunger 
my heartbeat lingers as I wonder; 
could it be that my affection lies ? 
I will have to try to comfort you what is on your mind ? 
as I woke this morning in the flare of my shame 
the claws of night still within reach 
I possessed the powers to arise from the pain 
there's a time and place for all 
and each consciousness 
abash inside me tears assunder, pleads me guilty 
could it be that my affection lies ? 
I will have to try to comfort you what is on your mind ? 
on an empty stage the play goes on 
I applaud the actors as they slowly pass 
guess it lies in mankinds constitution the vivid dreams 
... they seldom last
