I am a god 
I live tomorrow here today I am far too young to worry 
just open wide I see right through you anyway it's so easy to be free 
reach out 
reach out 
you'll live forever 
reach out 
reach out 
and I'll stand by 
when the water pulls you down 
when you stop to wonder why 
never hesitate 
just reach out for me when you're at the lost and found 
when you need a glimpse of light in the lack of faith 
just reach out for me 
I am a god 
but I don't wanna see you pray life is too short for reproaches 
just break the bond and you will find we are the same it's so easy to be me 
you must find strength you know I'm here for you 
reach out 
reach out 
it's now or never 
reach out 
reach out 
and cross that line
