music: Ostby, Khan / lyrics: Khan
I've seen the outline of a scheme a vision of tranquility 
the world in my profound embrace 
I've seen conclusions 
at the end a mellow hymn 
of promises the voice of god requesting me 
I provide you shelter from the cold 
so gather at my feet 
before the missionary man 
in the line for complete redemption 
I will make you understand 
heaven holds a place 
for those who pray 
I have the faith it takes 
to teach the tolerance of the lord 
a stage to play upon 
and when the cross is in the air 
I fold my hands and see 
a seat by god reserved for me 
I'm a new perspective for the lost 
their watchman in the night 
and I'm a missionary man 
advocate for a brand new order 
I will find the promised land 
in the souls I cut wide open amen 
I'll make you believe 
by the touch of my hand 
leave all you know behind 
and open your minds 
I'm a new dimension 
if you would obey
