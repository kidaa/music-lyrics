Outside of shell there is the 
Complex ability of forming the whole creations 
When you break there in your 
Material body it gets down on its knees 
The messages mentioned that there must be 
A small gate somewhere around gods ass 
Find the way to jump out of this 
Existence without priest and funeral 

Riding the Earth 
Fathom the land 
Pillars of mind, 
Give me your dream 

There will be the dark lord 
Awaiting the chosen 
Put him on his throne 
Then the circulation 
Of the cosmos 
Will have a break 

As it flashing through the sky 
All among the horizons 

It has unlimited forms as well of mercy 
So keep the life of one in a million 
To turn the wheel of cosmos through the break point 
From everything to nothing 
New visions appear on the new horizons
