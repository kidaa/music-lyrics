Lyrics: Logan, Esposito, Norman, Lynch
I was lonely and I was searchin' for the sun
Your one and only, took a trip to get undone
Well my high low mam, don't you give me the blues
Take me to the river where I can let it loose
All the lovin', ah like you never knew
Out back to where the dust grows old
Where the spirits fly so high
It was a cold dark night, and I swear we was feelin' right
As our bones took us down, straight to the light
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
All emotions, slip through my hands
Like an ocean movin', rollin' in on the sand  
A sea of love, honey, where you been
My love's been knockin' buy you ain't in
Where's my lover
Out back to where the dust grows old
Where the spirits never die
That cold dark night, but I know we was feelin' right
As we roll through the hours, down into the light
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
Days are long and the nights run deeper
Out back where the spirits never die
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
