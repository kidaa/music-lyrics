Lyrics: Brown, Esposito, Mason, Olsen
Hey, well come on over, girl
Shakin' ain't no crime
Show me what you've got an more
You work it oh so fine
Plays for days with wicked ways
Sensations on my mind
Drinks are cheap and so are you
You know I got the time
Oh no Ooh sweet frustration 
Oh no Another paycheck came and went
Oh no I can't resist tempation, no
Tie me up in the jungle of love
Let me sing between the things
That you've been swingin'
Tie me up in the jungle of love
Spread it, little queenie
You can look buy don't you touch
Tie me up
Ooh look out
Come on over, girl
You know I'm on the make
The way that I've been watchin' you
My heart is sure to break
Like a shot without a chaser
You bring me to my knees
I put my money where your mouth is
'Cause I know you aim to please
Oh no Ooh lord have mercy, yeah
Oh no Another drink before I'm dry
Oh no I wanna see what's on the menu
Tie me up in the jungle of love
Let me sing between the things
That you've been swingin'
Tie me up in the jungle of love
Ooh spread it, little queenie
You can look but you can't touch
Tie me up, tie me up
