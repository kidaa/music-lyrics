Lyrics: Mason, Esposito, Brown, Olsen
So many miles away
Thought of you fill my every day
I spent the empty hours
Hearing the last words you said
A thousand days between us
A thousand nights we spent apart
Trust in my love
You know only time can separate us
Imagine lost in my arms
Deep in a love that lasts forever
All I've ever wanted
Everything I've waited for
Hold me in your dreams 
Dream until tomorrow comes
I'm fighting time and distance
Illusion hides the fear inside
How can I bring you closer
I want you by my side
I lie awake and wonder
I'm all along for one more night
Trust in my love
You know only time can separate us
Your image burns in my mind
Deep in a love that lasts forever
All I've ever wanted
Everything I've waited for
Build my world around you
Let my love surround you darling
Hold me in your dreams
Dream until tomorrow comes
Trust in my love
You know only time can separate us
Imagine lost in my arms
Deep in a love that lasts forever
All I've ever wanted
Everything I've waited for
Build my world around you
Let my love surround you darling
Hold me in your dreams
Dream until tomorrow comes
All I've ever wanted
Everything I've waited for
Hold me in your dreams 
Dream until tomorrow comes
