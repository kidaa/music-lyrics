Lyrics: Logan
There ain't no tale to the story
'Cause it's all been done before
A finger that leads you
The fate that sees you
And who's to blame for it all, yeah
Flying high on cloud nine
Take me to your star
Won't you join me on the velvet glide
And open up your lovin' arms
'Cause I'm a hellchild
Howlin' at the moon
'Cause I'm a hellchild, hellchild
Oh, under the midnight moon
Spend my time just to drink my wine
You know I can't get higher
Foolish you think, but it is what it is
I've tasted pure desire
Imagination oh so wild
Glitters like a dancing flame
But I had my freedom, and well it tasted so good
Alright..
'Cause I'm a hellchild
Howlin' at the moon
'Cause I'm a hellchild, hellchild
Oh, under the midnight moon
My world might be up and down
And my head might be spinning
Round and round where I don't know
But my end might be just the beginning
'Cause I'm a hellchild
Howlin' at the moon
'Cause I'm ahellchild, hellchild
Oh, under the midnight moon
'Cause I'm ahellchild
Howlin' at the moon
Ain't good for nothin'
That's right, ain't good for nothing
Hear what I say
