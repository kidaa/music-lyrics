Lyrics: Brown, Esposito, Mason, Olsen
There's a feelin'
Little left of heaven
Shook me when you looked my way
Can't believe it
Legs that run forever
Love to know you better
Any time, any place
Fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' under your spell
Callin', callin'
If you leave me lonely
And you take away
The things that I love
Got a bad emotion
Tangled in the web of your love
Hypnotisin'
My temperature's risin'
Sweat rolls
From my head to your lips
No surprises
No, now nothin' disguises
The dangerous curve of your hips
Fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' under your spell
Callin', callin'
If you leave me lonely
And you take away
The things that I love
Got a bad emotion
Tangled in the web of your love
If you see me comin'
Better run and find
A place you can hide
Got a mad desire
Burnin' up my lovin' inside yeah
Oh, burnin' up my lovin' inside
Ooh baby, yeah
Fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' under your spell
Callin', callin'
If you leave me lonely
And you take away
The things that I love
Got a bad emotion
Tangled in the web of your love
If you see me comin'
Better run and find
A place you can hide
Got a mad desire
Burnin' up my lovin' inside yeah
Oh, burnin' up my lovin' inside

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tangled in the web of your love
