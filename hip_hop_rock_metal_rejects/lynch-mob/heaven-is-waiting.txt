Lyrics: Esposito, Lynch, Brown, Mason
I've been tryin'
Tryin' to show to you
The way I feel inside
It don't make no sense
To hide my feelings, no
No time for wastin'
Oh there's got to be a way
I beg, steal or take
The taste of tears
You throw my way
Heaven is waiting
How can you walk away, yeah
Don't walk away
Don't hurt me, love me, babe
Don't take your time, girl
Don't be late
I've been dyin'
Dyin' to tell you how
You tear me up inside
Just a look from you
Could make or break me 
Now, do you remember
Oh wehn you call my name
I got this...chance
My dreams won't fade away
Heaven is waiting
How can you walk away, yeah
Don't walk away
Don't hurt me, love me, babe
Don't take your time, girl
Don't be late
Oh no way
Don't turn away
I can't wait 
Heaven is waiting
How can you walk away, yeah
Don't walk away
Don't hurt me, love me, babe
Don't take your time, girl
Don't be late
Heaven is waiting
How can you walk away, yeah
Don't walk away
Don't hurt me, love me, babe
Don't take your time, girl
Don't be late
Heaven is waiting repeat
