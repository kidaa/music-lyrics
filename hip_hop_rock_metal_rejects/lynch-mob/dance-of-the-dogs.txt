Lyrics: Logan, Brown, Lynch, Esposito
In a dark and smokey room
A shade of webs that leads you to
A tattered stage thats worn and gray
Another gorl sweats for another day's wage
Oh under a silver moon
She leaves her thoughts behind
Yesterday's long gone cold
The hourglass of time
Lays heavy on her mind
Child, blessed with a smile
Shivers like a snake, the way she moves
Wild, oh so wild
Runnin' from her mind, but she always seems to lose
Under a silver moon, her eyes will never lie
She's on a trip so long
The hourglass of time lays heavy on her mind
And there ain't nothin' you can do
Dance, bitch, dance
'Til there's nothing left to hide
Dance, bitch, dance
Your mother should have taught you right
So wipe your tears away
Yeah, nice an' easy now, do it
Under a silver moon, her eyes will never lie
She's on a trip so long
The hourglass of time lays heavy on her mind
And there ain't nothin' you can do
Dance, bitch, dance
'Til there's nothing left to hide
Dance, bitch, dance
Your mother should have taught you right
So wipe your tears away
Dance, bitch, dance
'Til there's nothing left to hide
Dance, bitch, dance
Yesterday's long gone cold
Dance, bitch, dance
Your mother should have taught you right
