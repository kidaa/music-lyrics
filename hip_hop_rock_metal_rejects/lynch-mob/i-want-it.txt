Lyrics: Brown, Mason, Esposito
From the day our eyes first met
It's a time I can't forget
'Cause you're a ball of fire burnin'
Every woman needs a man
So baby, here I am
To make your wheels of love keep turnin'
No, tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tease me just enough
To keep me screamin'             
Through the night
You got a lot of love
And I want it
Let me take you
Let me make you mine
You got a lot of love
And I want it
I can't do without you
One more night
I'm spending every endless night
Let it burn with all my might
Honey, nothing gets me higher
Baby, if you just give in
We can both begin
To feelin' every burnin' fire

No, tell me I'm not dreamin'
Tease me just enough
To keep me screamin'             
Through the night
You got a lot of love
And I want it
Let me take you
Let me make you mine
You got a lot of love
And I want it
Never saw a woman
Look so right
Ooh, I can't do without you
One more night
I've been watching you, yes, I have
You got a lot of love
And I want it
Let me take you
Let me make you mine
You got a lot of love
And I want it
Never saw a woman
Look so right
You got a lot of love
And I want it
Let me take you
Let me make you mine
You got a lot of love
And I want it
I can't do without you
One more night
