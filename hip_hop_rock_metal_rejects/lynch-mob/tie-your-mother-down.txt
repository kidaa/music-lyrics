Brian May
Well, get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin', baby
I got my timin' right
I got my act uptight
It's got to be tonight
My little school babe
Your mana says you won't
And your daddy says you don't
But I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way
I'm gonna lose out this time
No way
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosin' around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties
In fact, i don't think
I've ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out alright
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all this bitchin'
And moanin', that's right
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother
Swimmin' with a brick, that's all right
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Yeah, one tme
Oh your mom and your dad
They're gonna brain me till i die
Why can't they understand
I'm just a be stubborn guy
Oh yeah
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
repeat
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Yeah
Tie your mother down repeat
Give me all your love tonight
