Lyrics: Logan
Well my sweet sister mercy
What have you done?
You made a mess of me
And now I'm so undone
Don't you like, don't you care
Don't you leave me in deep despair
Oh, it feels like I'm driftin'...
Just a fool in the pourin' rain
Locked out behind closed doors
Will you be waiting to catch my fall?
You know I'll search for a light
That will lead me to heaven
Sweet sister mercy
Where are you now
Sweet sister mercy
High road to nowhere
And I'm leavin' very soon
Tomorrow, you say
But it's just like yesterday
My sense of direction's confused
You know I'll plead to the morning light
That wherever's wrong
She would make it right
Please soul sister, hear my plea
I'll keep searchin' for a light
That will lead me to heaven
Sweet sister mercy
Where are you now
Sweet sister mercy
Sweet sister mercy
Where are you now
Sweet sister mercy
Where are you now
Sweet sister mercy
Will you be there to catch my fall?
Sweet sister mercy
'Cause I'll keep searchin' for a lifetime
That will lead me, that will lead me
Lead me to heaven
Sweet sister mercy
Sweet sister, sweet sister mercy
Sweet sister mercy
