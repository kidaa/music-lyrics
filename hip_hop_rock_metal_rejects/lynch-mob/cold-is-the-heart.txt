Lyrics: Esposito, Mason, Olsen, Brown
Just a habit on her knees at night
...screams and she treats you right
Heart so warm and oh so cold
One down, one more story told, yeah
Strange enchanted love
Icy hand and a velvet glove
What can you hold when your day is done
Count your tears and pray for sun
Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As she sits on the face of the world
Like the daily bump and grind
What's your price
For a chance on the mainline
Checks desires..be last
Silent eyes of a checkered past
Is your love the test of time
Faded days that'll ease your mind
What can you do when you're near the end
Try so hard but you can't pretend
Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As she sits on the face of the world
Strange enchanted love
Icy hand and a velvet glove
What can you hold when your day is done
Count your tears and pray for sun
Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As it sits in the world
Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
She just sits on the face of the world.
