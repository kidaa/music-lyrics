Lyrics: Logan, Brown, Esposito
Every night when you go out walking
Every step you take keeps me yearning for some more
Those green cat-eyes pull me down inside
And yo jelly liyups can't push me away, no note: what the hell is a liyup?
'Cause baby, when we're alone
Everything's alright
And baby, right or wrong
Lemme give ya some lovin' all my own
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
You know that one thang that brings me to my knees
That's all I want, you know thats all I need
Is to call you
Yeah, you know it seems pretty crazy
When your dad told me I was headed for the killin' floor
But I just can't deny what I feel inside
Yeah, you know when twelve rolls around
I'll be knocking at your bedroom door 
'Cause baby, when we're alone
Everything's just right
And baby, right or wrong
Lemme show ya some lovin' all my own
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
You know that one thang that brings me to my knees
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
Is to call you all my own
'Cause baby, when we're alone
Yeah, everything's alright
And baby, right or wrong
Lemme give ya some lovin' all my own
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
You know that one thang that brings me to my knees
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
Is that one thing to call my own
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
You know that one thang that brings me to my knees
That's all I want, you know it's all I need
Is to call you all my own
