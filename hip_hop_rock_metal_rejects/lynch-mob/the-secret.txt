Lyrics: Esposito, Brown, Mason, Olsen
From the cradle to the grave
Lord, how much longer till I'm saved
Eyes once opened, never closed
That's the gateway to your soul
There's no honor ever shown
In every world
We can't hold the secret any longer
But I know he'll never tell
I swear he'll never tell
Shadows ragin' on the wall
Sounds of screamin' down the hall
Bonds that break and rules to bend
Will the beatings ever end
Time for sorrow, time for pain
In every world
We can't hold the secret any longer
But I know he'll never tell
The night becomes his hell
We can't hold the secret any longer
But I know he'll never tell
I swear he'll never tell
We can't hold the secret any longer
But I know he'll never tell
The night becomes his hell
