Lyrics: Lynch, Logan
In wheels of no return
And dreams that fade along the way
Never to grow old, and change
Shades of long memories
The times that I've been on my knees
I try to believe in somethin'
But i call out to no one
You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
Gor a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years
In this world of heartless desires
I try to understand
The church of new love's waiting
To take us by the hand
Just believe, believe in somethin'
No matter if it's love or money
'Cause whatever gets you through your life
Is alright, it's alright by me
You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
For a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years
'Til the skies come falling down
'Til the walls come crumbling down
I'll wait, wait for you
You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
For a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years
'Til the skies come falling down
'Til I pick myself up from the ground
I'll wait, wait for you
