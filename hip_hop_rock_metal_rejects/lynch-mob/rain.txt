Lyrics: Logan
So ya love your money, honey, love the dope
Fill your dreams with a thousand hopes
You know I just don't know
What you're looking for, oh
And now's the time, but its' just a little too late
Shy, she was shy
She took a one way ticket on an endless ride
Well it's on and on
She ain't never coming down
Right, it's alright
Being hungry child
You know it ain't no crime
Her burning fire, just looking for a better way
Oh, but as the time seems to pass her by 
And the memories fade away
Rain
As it pours in her world
Rain
Oh how she weeps without a sound
Smokeless nights, as you're out on your own
When you stop and wonder
If your heart has turned to stone
Then you take a drag from your smoke
And blow your thoughts away
But time and time as you look around
As to what you see
Rain
As it pours in her world
Rain
Oh how she weeps without a sound
But she still wants more
Oooh, yeah, yeah
Things will never change
Shame, lust
How you walk around with your head above the clouds
Oooh, yeah, yeah
And you're never coming down
Rain
As it pours in her world
Rain
Oh how she weeps without a sound
