Six cheap people in an empty hotel 
Every last one with a story to tell 
Give them all pills, so their heads won't swell 
We were borne to a woman whose husband did quite well 
Oh sunshine, shone brighty 
Through my windoew today 
Could have tripped out quite easy but I decided to stay 
Hold ouit your hand said whitey with the blame 
Gonna bring you up so you really dig the pain 
Take you under my wings so you'll never be the same 
Cos your wife is so much older and both her legs are lame 
A sunbeam shone brightly through my window today 
Could have gone 20 miles but I decided to stay 
All my flock has packed up and flocked back to hell 
Open up the windows so the place don't start to smell 
Carry on with what your doing cos you don't to it that well 
I've been umpteen different people and no one else can tell 
Sunshine shone brightly through my asshole today 
Could have tripped out quite easy but I decided to stay 
To stay a while 
Come up and see me make me smile 
Come up and see me make me smile
