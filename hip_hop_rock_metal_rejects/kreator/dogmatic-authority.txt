Ruin is your profit
Meraud the hollow mind
Religious passion is not for you
Agnostic modern science
Suffocate superior forces
Tearing down this fortress of control
Dogmatic authority falls
Alternative to submission
Mental emancipation
Severance, selection of
All powers from above
Strong minded in preparation
For this sickening mess
We're living in
Threat for your security
Authority will collapse
End pseudo-democracy
Take fate in your own hands
Violent terroristic action
Only self-defense
Ignorence is unconsciousness
No pessimistic vision
Corruption pseudo peace
Propaganda drug of nation
Deceiving you and me
Psychosocial revolt
Becomes aware, horowing truth
Hear my call !
