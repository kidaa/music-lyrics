For the first time in my life
I've seen the fire within your eyes
My mind it screams for shelter now
I know i've got to resist some how
My religion my certain death
My salvation my sacriledge
My inner sanctum my prophecy
You've become everything and more to me
So our souls will be one
A new era has begun
Fantasies will come true
Not only for the Chosen Few
For freedom is a two edged sword
And life is only a gift for gods
Straight from the heart of the serpent's kiss
To see something as it really is
My prescious kingdom my empire
My tragedy and my desire
My life's blood my shining light
Feels like i am finally alive
