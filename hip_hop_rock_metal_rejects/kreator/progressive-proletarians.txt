3:25
Evidence, freedom total fake
Media projection to enslave
Subject of this system you became
Object of derision total pain
Constantly deny your misery
Can't critizise a fact you cannot see
Interference mindwar affairs
Guaranteed existance of despair
Defiant generation
Total violent generation
Servants modern day dictatorship
Disabled too confused to get a grip
Limited perception slavery
Genius built to crush integrity
Infertility of soulless lifes
Defenceless to the visions of the mind
Ghost of strategy alienation
Exterminating powers of lifes passion
Children of the future
Got own paths to go
Some will choose to follow
Some refuse control
Keep the faith in powers
Of integrity
Progressive proletarians
