Impending doom, assassinate
Agressive drive explodes
Uncontrollable resistance
Paeallised dismay
Agenda carried all around
The world is in a shock
Terroristic action brutal
Sacrifice and loss
Bomb threat - final warning
No statistic prediction saw it comin'
Hateful dedication
Defecate your force
Dehuminization
Panic hits the nation
People keep fighting back
Pushed to the limits in pain
Ready for anything
Now or never laws made to break
People keep fighting back
Movement united by hate
Together break down the walls
Terrorists blood marks their way
Panic hits the nation
A wave of fear, a psychic shock
Radical impact of the blast
Frightening mayhem, terror, doom
There is nothing you can do
Extremists on a mission
A reawoken scorn
Of a lost civilisation
