One by one we take control
New consciousness, one heart, one soul
Oppression ends, the time has come
So don't look back, it can be done
Something is still missing
Something keeps 'em blind
Like a prescious sacrilege
They can never find
So they walk together
Into a silent war
Though it seems to take forever
This generation is finaly heading for...
A Better Tomorrow
Tell me can't you feel it?
Tell me can't you see it?
Tell me can't you hear it?
I know it ain't just me
Let us walk together
What are we waiting for?
It is now or never
This generation is finaly heading for...
A Better Tomorrow
Day by day we're praying for,
It to come across the shores
It brings new hope, it brings new light
Nameless spirits now they shine
One by one become aware
New consciousness will be there
And all the blind
Now they will see, embrace their minds
To plant the seeds for...
A Better Tomorrow
