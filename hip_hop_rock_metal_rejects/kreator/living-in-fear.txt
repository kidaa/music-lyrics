3:12
Endless destruction
Blood falls like rain
The war of the demons
Will give you pain
Inverted crosses
The reaper will rise
The war of the demons
Will make you die
I'll take you down into my grave
I'll rip your flesh and torment your face
Your cry in the night none will hear
It's time to die you're living in fear
Fight with the mortals
Death is their goal
Eating the corpses
And sell all their souls
Obey the commands
Of the black majesty
You know your soul
Will never be free
