Planet left by its god
Ideology died and the vision is gone
Opression part of the plot
Degrading life into material force
Emptiness pain in their faces
Viscious expression of purest hate
Nightmares fulfill
Nightmares fulfill
Grotesque abstraction
Deformed lost in their fate
Lunatics murder without any reason
A killer instinct that enslaves
Endangered dying species for societies
Fabric nameless tools lost their face
Atrocity conquered the mind
Decadent deligation repulsive elite
Violent emotionless time
Decade of militant brutal prestige
Emptiness pain in their faces
Viscious expression of purest hate
Nightmares fulfill
Grotesque abstraction deformed
Lost in their fate
Lunatics murder without any reason
A killer instinct that enslaves
Endangered dying species for
Societys fabric nameless tools
Lost their face
Descent to the void
Human vultures of the soul
Impurity destroyed
A new religion of control
Bizare moral catastrophe
Wasteland left by the almighty
Mindwar of freezing fear
A new kingdom of terror is here
Screaming dying from inside
Slave to the master of all lies
Desperate men turn into beasts
Scavengers of cancerous desease
Paradise was only an illusion
Hell on earth became so real
A place the ancient ones forgot
