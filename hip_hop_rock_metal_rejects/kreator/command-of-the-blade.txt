3:56
Mist is rising as he rides over the land
With his blade of steel he's coming to take you
He has seen the battles of the damned he has lost and won
he's coming to break your
Flesh and bones scared to scream
Scared to cry
Await your fate no one will save you
You're damned to die
Warrior of the king mission to kill
Death to all his aim is to give you
Command of the blade when you fall
His mission's complete
He's gonna get you
Command of the blade
His cape is black his eyes glowing red
He's seeking for you he wants to rape you
His lifeless body has decayed long ago
His skeleton's riding
Coming to break your
Neck and bones scared to scream too late to cry
Your fate is hear you hear his steps
Now you die
Warrior of the king
Mission to kill
Death to all his aim is to give you
Command of the blade he will laugh as you fall
His aim is to give you
DEATH !!!!!!!!!
When you die by his blade
Your corpse lies here to decay
No one will miss your dumb face
No one be left there to pray
The KREATOR rides back to his kingdom
To receive another command
Soon he will be back here
To conquor and rule over the land
