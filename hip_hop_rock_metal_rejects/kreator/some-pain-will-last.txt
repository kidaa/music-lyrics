Intence devastation of nature
Constructing a future for a man
The world is sold dirt cheap
For promises no one can ever keep
There is no hope ,just decay
Creation leads only to chaos
The very first years of your life
Mother makes things right
But soon you just cannot deny
This is only a lie
We live in a world of
Hate and deceit,
Corruption and greed
Just wait my friend,you will see
Misery's coming your way,horror
And pain reserved for you
CHORUS
Some pain will last,last forever
Etrnal slaves of morbid minds
Helpless and blind
Dealers of heartless opression
Controlling mankind
Resistence is quelled,it's birth
Incomplete,nochance to succeed
And those,those who don't care
If you live or die
Are nver around to shoulder the blame
CHORUS REPEATS
Time,time flies fast you will feel
Still a child tomorrow you'll be
A man full of hopes and dreams
Dreams are destroyed easily
Prepare,prepare for some pain
Unknown
Planned and arranged for so long
Chemical mutants arise
A genrations born just to die
Born just to die,whole generation
Born just to die!
