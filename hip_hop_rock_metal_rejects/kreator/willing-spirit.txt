After death has taken you from life
You have come to me in the night
The aura of an ancient beauty shining through
Like a goddess of fallen grace
I'm longing for your souls embrace
And all that life has lost i've found in you
The spirit is willing the flesh is weak
Just like a thousand suns it shines on me
The spirit is willing the flesh is weak
For now i'm seeing more than the eye can see
So i wait as i watch the stars
I feel you're near but you're yet too far
Too heal me from the flames that penetrate my mind
I could swear that i 've felt your touch
Your magic presence i need so much
Becomes reality only at night
The spirit is willing the flesh is weak
Just like a thousand suns it shines on me
The spirit is willing the flesh is weak
For now i'm seeing more than the eye can see
As i watch you disappear in silence
Was it really true or just a dream
As morning drags me back to life
And swallowed everything
Illusion killed the angel without wings
