Death of emotions
Birth of decay
Fight revolution
Grips the heart of men
Rising rebellion
Loosing control
Pure mental terror
Reformation needed to be
Raised to future awareness
Manipulation has failed
Rulers, leaders
Anarchy will prevail, now
Reinforced hate
Glowing, pulsate
Society failed
New generation awakes
Mental slavery, through erasure
Cause for your condition
Mind murdering parasites
Forced into suicide
Material safety, plastic savious
Basis of possession
Rulers participate
Anarchist dominate
Infected by a virus promise of a better
Pay, conception of a master plan
Protectors of blind faith
Raise to new awareness
Individual way of life
A dated shit philosophy
Youth runs amok
Moloch masters, democrats
Diplomats, desperation
Criminal energy, part of the strategy
Focus distraction, pain infection
Manipulation failed
Misleading disharmony
Now only victory
Life becomes perfection, when the spark
Has almost died
Decades of endless darkness
Now embraced by shining light
Autonomous power,
Finally this war is won
Golden days of anarchy
The new age has begun
Moloch masters, democrats
Diplomats, desperation
Criminal energy, part of the strategy
Focus distraction, pain infection
Manipulation failed
Misleading disharmony
Now only victory
Life becomes perfection, when the spark
Has almost died
Decades of endless darkness,
Now embraced by shining light
Autonomous power,
Finally this war is won
Golden day of anarchy
The new age has begun
Fear of the future
Hope for the past
Hymns of enslavement
Forever laid to rest
Elders tomorrow
Youth of today
Choice for a changing
Better world needed to be
Raised to future awareness
Manipulation has failed
Rulers leaders
