We thought we could use this live recording from
Lichtenfels, Germany '92, to give you an impression of the
energy exchange between us and our fans. that can only be
created in a club or concert hall. No matter in which part
of the world we play, it's always the universal language
of metal music that connects us with people from all kinds
of different cultural backgrounds. It might sound like a
clich, but to me it's one of the most precious gifts in
life!!!
Hypnotized by the masses
And a future torn apart
Angony, the final conflict
Hatred yet ignored
Love is colder than death
And in coldness we'll remain
Everlasting lies in chains
Destroying dreams against all norms
They spread it all across the earth
Dominion without a form
Winter martyrium
Dead civilization on a mission
Lead by gods
Etiquette creates a cause
To turn your back from life
Secrets never told before
Construct culture absurd
Hit you like a shellshock
As integrity has died
Destroying dreams...
Wide awake to the end
Wide awake to the end
Crisis and perpetual incest
Performance of a nameless act
Sadness takes your concentration
Individual cages that we face
Destroying dreams against all norms
They spread it all across the earth
Dominion without a form
Winter martyrium for masses
And a future torn apart
Agony, the final conflict
Hatred yet ignored
