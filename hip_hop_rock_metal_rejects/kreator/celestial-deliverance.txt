3:14
Deception into your soul
It will creep
Like the foundation of a certain demise
Reflection facing a vision so deep
Leaves reality seem like a lie
Downward, the only way
Soulless interaction
Beneath you, dragin' you down
Drowning your soul erased
Altered state addiction
Slowly, into decline
Magic enlightment celestial deliverance
Taking horrors carry them away
Supernatural redemption
A narcotic mirage
Creates a psychotic haze
Downward, the only way
Soullesss interaction
Beneath you, dragin' you down
Prowning your soul erased
Altered state addiction
Slowly, into decline
Crying, so afraid to let go
Falling into a neverending hole
