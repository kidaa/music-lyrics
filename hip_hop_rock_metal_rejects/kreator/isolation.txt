Here in isolation
Seeing more than the eye can see
Safe in peaceful silence
So far out or reach
Closer to purest liberty
Isolation is what I seek
Manifest of a long lost truth
Where pain and agony
Is absolute
In this life of sadness
True serenity lies within
Dream of distant places
Where no soul has ever been
In my mind
No time no space
So close
Misery, I can escape
