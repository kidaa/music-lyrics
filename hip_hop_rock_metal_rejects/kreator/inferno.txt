One hundred lives in just one night
The fire took them all
A revolution from inside
Damned to rule our souls
From far away i heard them scream
I saw them burned alive
No one could flee, he came too fast
Impossible conception lies the...
Inferno, Inferno
All their dreams, all their hopes
All that they obey
All despotic fantasies
Erased in just one day
From far away i seen them die
So many burned alive
Damned from our society
Impossible conception lies the...
Inferno, Inferno
Suddennly it really happened
Suddenly it comes to life
The Inferno!
Inferno, Inferno
Suddennly it really happened
Suddenly it comes to life
The Inferno!
