Ending all religions
Changes yet to come
Whole new situation
Fear became too strong
Send a spark of hatred
To where I cannot rest
My fate's depending on me
Pushed to the test
Depression unrest
As I watch the sky
The sparks will keep on falling
And I despise you now
Praying for forgiveness
Waiting for a sign
It cannot be forgotten
A symbol used to shine
Feel the spark of hatred
Spreading like some pest
Emotional mutation
Curse of the west
Depression unrest
As cultures die
The sparks will keep on falling
And I hate you now
our mind
See the world inside
Oversees your life
Decides the day you die
Silent lifetaker
Sentient creator
Worlds recoil in fear
Of the hidden dictator
