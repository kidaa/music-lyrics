Minutely planned professional crime assassination at night
Cold-blooded killers on a midnight hunt for a girl who cannot fight
Kidnapped, tortured, skinned alive victim of wanton abuse
Without protection a life is lost condemned for speaking the truth
Manic
Panic will you suffer endlessly
From agents of brutality
Speak the truth pay the price
The unjust reign the innocent cry
Abomination in the dead of night
Polished metal gleams
Deadly weapons in the hands of beasts
Another martyr screams
A victim cringes, staggers, falls and struggles to live on
But soon enough their mission done
The spark of life is gone
Manic
Panic will you suffer endlessly
From agents of brutality
Torment
Murder you will die a thousand times
Before they finally let you die
SOLO - MILLE
Speak the truth pay the price
The unjust reign the innocent cry
SOLO - FRANK
