Forever torn apart
Forever gone
Forever things will come
Back to the start
Forever honesty
Forever gone
Forever trust to me
There can't be none
Though you don't comply at all
There's a way out of this hole
As the shadow breaks the crust
Your soul is mine Forever
Forever senseless tears
Forever lies
Forever shameless fear
You won't pass by
Forever cannot win
Forever try
Forever live in sin
Under the sky
