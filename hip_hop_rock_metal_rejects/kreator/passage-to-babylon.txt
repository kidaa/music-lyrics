I can take you anything you want to be
I can show you anything you want to see
I can make your hidden fantasies come true
I can make you see things from a different view
Just keep running further down
Never stop don't turn around
Looking back but never stare
No regrets you should not care
Just keep running to the light
Heading for what sleeps inside
Colours brighter than the sun
I'm the only one who knows the
Last Passage To Babylon
I can take you anywhere you want to go
I can teach you anything you need to know
I can show you ways out of this tragedy
I can give you life the way it used to be
Soon we'll see what lies beyond
What will be what's soon to come
Something life can't offer you
A prescious gift one cannot lose
Come to babylon with me now come
