When nothing's left for us to say
Substance leads me through the day
All the green has turned to gray
Like shadows fall from those who died
Black Sunrise
Darkened the Earth
For jesus lives in every shot
When i'm there I'll talk to god
Now I can see things you cannot
Like mirrors in eternity
Black Sunrise
Darkened the Earth
Black Sunrise
Over the Earth
Why can I see the light no more?
Everything became so much harder than before
Like a swamp it pulls me further down
god I know I've gone too far
I am dying just to look inside
