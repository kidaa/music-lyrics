Your whole live you've been a misfit in your area
Nobody want to hang out with a guy like you
But now you've found new friends no longer an inferrior
And you act exactly the way they do
Life your life now seems to make sense
You've got someone to obey
The wrong ideals of your friends
But for me it seems you're
chorus Impossible impossible to cure
The way you think
Is wrong that's for sure
The way you act
Won't bring you no fame
Open your eyes
Face the thruth you will never your dreams
As long as we stand against you extreme
Forgetit we won't let your dreams come true
Can't you see you're just swimming with the stream
chorus
