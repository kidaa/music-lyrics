What is yours, it ain't mine
Become a capitalist and follow blind
Staring into empty eyes
I can't see no more truth behind those lies
I don't believe
I don't agree
I'm the one you fear forever...
Nonconformist
Count the days that pass you by
Minds erased, the individual dies
Conform into society
And you become your own worst enemy
I don't believe
I don't agree
I'm the one you fear forever...
Nonconformist
They'll burn your dreams
Pollute your mind
And you don't even see it
Do you want to see it?
They'll take away
All you have
And you don't even see it
Do you want to see it?
Nonconformist
