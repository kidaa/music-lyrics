SOLO - FRANK
Dehumanization through industrialization
Bring fear to the masses of reincarnation
Manic frustration deterioration
Nature fights back for its own preservation
Concrete coffin breeds lunacy
Cold steel skeleton
Desperation in the factory
Crank out oblivion
Material world paranoia
Corporations rule the earth
Material world paranoia
Enslavery begins at birth
Power's illusion brings global confusion
A forgone conclusion of mind's evolution
Nature's destruction through massive production
A blatant example of mindless construction
Concrete coffin breeds lunacy
Cold steel skeleton
Desperation in the factory
Crank out oblivion
Material world paranoia
Don't dream about how life can be
Experience your dreams
Before this prefab culture wastes your life
Stay on the straight and narrow course
Material wealth is yours
But the promise of a better future is a lie
SOLO - MILLE
The promise of a better future is nothing but a lie
