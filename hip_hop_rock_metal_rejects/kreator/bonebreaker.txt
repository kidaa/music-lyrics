He bursts their heads till they die
You feel so mad you're feeling so high
He arrives he's sent from hell
Running wild by the sound of the bell
Bonebreaker he takes your life
Bonebreaker he eats out your heart
Bonebreaker he is your death
Bonebreaker
Tonight you'll beat 'em down
Tear to shreds and shoot 'em down
When he's down you've got the right feel
He bursts your head with his blade of steel
