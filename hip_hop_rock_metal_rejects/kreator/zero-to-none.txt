Dominance in devotion
Grabs us and disappears
Have to take some direction
Through the glass that we must break
Zero to none
Killing radical
The instinct to destroy what's left
Lives in everyone
All prepared for the moment
Yet to come complete the rest
Patriots all confused by
Characters of broken men
Zero to none
Killing radical
The instinct to destroy what's left
Lives on in everyone
A dream within a dream
A womb within a grave
Calm without a riot
Every heart, every soul, all the trust
Terror wars are radical
A dream within a dream
A womb within a grave
Calm within a riot
All the peace, all the hope, all the trust
As desperation takes everyone
God's hell is radical
