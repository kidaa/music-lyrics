Pandemonium all around
Can't you fell it coming down
Pandemonium in my brain
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
And now you know the answer
And now you see the truth
Swallow this bitter pill
As all religion dies for you
and all the things that happened
In all those times long gone
Gave birth to life like lies
Apocalyptic pandemonium
Pandemonium
Pandemonium in the air
god has left us in despair
Desperate could not stand the pain
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Now that your world is buring
Now that it ends in tears
Inferno has arrived
Nothing can make it disappear
And all the things that happened
In all those times long gone
Gave birth to life likes lies
Apocalyptic pandemonium
Pandemonium
A psychodrama is dragging you
Out of a life surreal
A better future waits for you
A life that might have been
So give your soul and you may live
Limitless fantasies
This celebration of the night
Can light your shattered life
If you believe...
