In a land where no love can be born
Self destruction everywhere
A restless soul on it's search for an answer
Sees through this masquerade of dispair
In a time where no love can be born
Desperation frozen eyes
A restless soul so alone no direction
Suffering as they follow the blind
This is a new dawn rising
Over this Shadowland
Tearing you from the world that you used to know
In a land where no love can be born
Isolation is the price
And the horror of this cold souless place here
Put everlasting stains on your life
In a time where no love can be born
Another crisis yet to come
A senseless life breeds a senseless death
Wondering what kind of pain will come next
Tired of being alive losing every time
Suffering side by side shadows of mankind
