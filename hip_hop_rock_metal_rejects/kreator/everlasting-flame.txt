The atmosphere around you is dark and cold
You're only seventeen but in your heart you're feeling old
But one day you will leave this place of fear
Escape to somewhere far away far away from here
A grain of sand at the ocean shore
Faceless lost with the urge for more
Can't break free suffering in pain
Following the Everlasting Flame
The factory walls here leave no room to breath
You're thirty four and some old friends became only memories
And still you need to hide your bitter tears
And dream of somewhere far away far away from here
Swallowed by this material world
Pre ordained from his death to birth
Can't break free suffering
Following the Everlasting Flame
There's just no way out of this living hell
You're fifty six now just a shadow of your broken self
A wasted life the pain won't disappear
You'll never see a better place far away from here
Swallowed by this material world
Pre ordained from his death to birth
Can't break free suffering
Following the Everlasting Flame
