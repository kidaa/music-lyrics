Let me take you down
Deeper than you know
Reality is gone
Yet so much to show
Let me take you down
Let us look inside
There's still so much to come
It's time to say goodbye
Broken dreams
Misery replaced by constant extasy
Wide awake open wide
existance of a better kind
Waits for you waits for me
Our minds become forever free
Free of fear free of rage
The coming of the Golden Age for all
Let me take you down
Let life fade away
The ritual has begun
Your life begins today
Let me take you down
Explore the other side
Enlightened as we drown
It's time to say goodbye
Don't you turn around now
Don't you be afraid now
Just turn another page now
Celebrate the Golden Age
