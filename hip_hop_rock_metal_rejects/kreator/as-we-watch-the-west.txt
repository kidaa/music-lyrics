On the edge i wait
See what fate may come
Just one step away
From what's left undone
On the edge i wait
Pain must stand right here
Right before my eyes
In the dreams that disapear
Silently it just dies
As We Watch The West Decline
On The edge i wait
See what fate will bring
For i have become
One with everything
One the edge i wait
Center of the light
Visions focus now
What a mind blowing sight
Silently it just dies
As We Watch The West Decline
One the edge i wait
Finally i've arived
What i'm looking for
Seemed so hard to find
On the edge i wait
Everlasting fear
Of what fate may come
It was never so clear
Silently it just dies
As We Watch The West Decline
