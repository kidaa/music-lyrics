Indecisive government
Regardless of brutal punishment
Indestructable regiment
Twice as many lives
Perversion never too bizarre
Can't remember who we are
Influenced us to get this far
Emotions paralyzed
Monotony provokes the escalation
Terrifying industry protect departed nations
Can't get back together again
Leaving Europe after the rain
Acceptance of neo-fascist
Persecuting anarchists
Put the wrong ones on the list
Let the new age begin
Monotony provokes the escalation
Terrifying industry protect departed nations
Can't get back they're going insane
Leaving Europe after the rain
Can't look at the world the way I did before,
Can't ignore they've all mutated into materialistic
parasites
Can't forget the pictures I saw on television
Can't close my eyes on this abstract spectrum
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Forcing them to support without asking
Imprisoned in factories for a lifetime
Reasons are becoming meaningless
Optimism leaves the bitter taste of hopelessness
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Monotony provokes the escalation
terrifying industry protect departed nations
Can't get back they're going insane
Leaving Europe after the rain
A complex keeps the industries
In motion, for some new disease
Bound to those who still resist
Yet harder to find
Monotony provokes the escalation
terrifying industry protect departed nations
Can't get back they're going insane
Leaving Europe after the rain
