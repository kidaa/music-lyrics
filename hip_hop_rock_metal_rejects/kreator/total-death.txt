Time has come, the peace can't stand
Masters of switsch now rule the land
Push their switch and send the death
Politician warpigs got only shit in their heads
Chorus:
Try to run or hide from the death
You will burn and bleed from your head
Total death, total death, total death, total death
No one can escape the burning flames
The flesh and skin decay from your face
Hundred megatons lie on every soul
Destroy the human race is their goal
Destroy the weapons on this earth
Or it's gonna be the end of the world
If they send one order death becomes alive
And there ain't no God who helps us when we die
