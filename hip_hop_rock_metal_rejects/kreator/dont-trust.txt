The only truth I've ever heard
Is the truth I've spoken myself
A pack of lies is all I get from
Anybody else
Experience shows that I'm right
So be careful what you choose to
Believe
CHORUS
You can't believe in nothing
Insane to trust in anything
So I don't trust in no one
But myself
What happened to your honesty
Did it take a back seat
To your greed
Forgotten cause you've
Found out you need to live a lie
And if you question why you have
A future without security
Just fear and lies and terror
No one can tell you why
Synthetic creatures ordered
And numbered
Unsympathic to everyone
Death of intelligence and
Emotions
Preordained from death to day one
Lost trust in the future
Lost faith in prophecies
Lost truth in government promices
Lost hope for honesty
