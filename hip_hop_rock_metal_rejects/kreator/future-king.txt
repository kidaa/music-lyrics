All seen before it goes on forever more
This time your truth just offers nothing new
Walking down the empty streets of never-ending tragedy
Nothing here can touch my heart this loneliness tears me apart
Beneath the dark deep ocean
Prepare the gathering
Pray for the saviour's coming
A glorius Future King
Buring in 1999
Drowing in 99
All felt before fake people come and go
Get high headrush into this mental crush
Drug messiah make me warm your promises won't do no harm
Trapped here with this dying race your touch my only saving grace
Beyond the dark horizon
I hear the sirens sing
In traumatic devotion
Of what the future brings
Burning in 1999
Drowning in 99
With the taste of bitter freedom i'm sinking in your world
I know deep inside your weeping about your life absurd
Silently your soul is screaming a scream that won't be heard
No light no sound this world goes round and round
You rise you drown this world goes round and round
Burning in 1999
Drowning in 99
