It never left this world
Negative part of duality
That is the cause
For all men's evil
The force that leads to endless wars
To destroy what's been built
Over the centuries
Element of fear
Ever present
Eternal hatred
Spirit of demise
Conquered our minds again
Wartime confrontation
Conflit ends in rage
Sadistic tendencies awake
Progress turned the land
Into a mountain of dead bodies
Sculpture of regret
Triumph of the primitive
Knowing earthly peace
Ain't possible
Sheltering mutation
Protection from demise
Euthanasia demands
Violence is the modern way of life
No direction got nowhere to go
Death, aggresion, terror, from below
War is reality
Peace just a fantasy
Hellish disharmony
Repression misery
Kill for your fatherland
This war will never end
In this field of corpses
War drags ever on
Ability to kill the proof
Murder and aggression
