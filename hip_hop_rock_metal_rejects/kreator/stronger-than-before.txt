This life has brought you down
Pushed your face into the ground
Like ahuman sacrifice
Trapped within a world of lies
This life just took it all
Almost deaf to hear the call
Aggression is the only way
Expression no one can explain
Power to find some piece of mind
Exploring all the fear you hide
It's in your heart it's in your blood
Getting out Stronger Than Before
This life is filled with pain
Sorrow grips your heart again
Neverending misery
Chaos sucks your energy
This life without a home
Got no place to call your own
Aggression is the only way
To express your burning rage
Power to find some piece of mind
Exploring all the fear you hide
It's in your heart, it's in your blood
Getting out Stronger Than Before
