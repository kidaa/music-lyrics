Land of solitude
A place of horror dark and cruel
There's no need to seek the truth
Opinions are provided for you
Innocence of youth
Full of visionary fantasies
From subconscious laboratories
Try to break the chains of barbarity
Servants to mother machine
Nursed by video screens
Paradise of insanity
Born into a grave of
Mental slavery
Lost in dark reality
Mental slavery
Memories of the past
Holy empires of harmony
Visions only children see
Are soon removed by society
Replaced by numbing fear
The horror show of rules sets in
Total control of thought begins
Another car on the highway of sin
Servants to mother machine
Nursed by video screens
Paradise of insanity
Born into a grave of
Mental slavery
Lost in dark reality
Mental slavery
SOLO - FRANK
Just one of a million slaves
An expendable commodity
This song's for those who serve
The system of terror
That rules the earth
