3:31
You cry out the aggression that is in you everyday
You want to kill the enemies if they cross your way
In your heart is hate, terror is freezing your bones
The night is dark and you're all alone
The voices of hell sound so nice
Final death is the price
Can't wait much longer give them what they need
Burst down their heads spread hellish heat
Feel the endless pain
Locked in metal chains
Green and red monsters torment your mind
The power of death will destroy mankind
You die fast you won't feel much pain
But why you'll never know
It's a hellish game
