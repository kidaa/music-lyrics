Reach for the reaper's scythe
Sailing the river Styx
Watching the other side
Casting an ancient hex
Journey to the gates of hell
Dying to break the bond
Nothing but a soul to sell
No room in satan's pond
Fearless mind
Ghost explores
Spectre flies
Journey to the world beyond
Casting off spheres of pain
Revel in joy you've found
Laughing as colours fade
Flying free and unbound
The bargain has been kept
>From beyond the gate souls call
It's too late for regrets
On deaf ears pleading falls
Fearless mind
Ghost explores
Spectre flies
Journey to the world beyond
SOLO - MILLE
SOLO - FRANK
Fearful mind
Spectre trapped
No return
Welcome to the world beyond
