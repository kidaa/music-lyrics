Ruin Of Life, the end is near
So why don't you take me away?
Ruin Of Life will end in tears,
So why don't you take me away?
Just like a curse upon your spirit,
Heart, soul, and mind
Like a cloud illusion takes your sight
Ruin Of Life
Ruin Of Life, they'll blow it for all
So why don't you take me away?
Ruin Of Life, we'll be pushed in a hole
So why don't you take me away?
Just like a curse upon your spirit,
Heart, soul, and mind
Like a cloud illusion takes your sight
Ruin OF Life
When the ground benieth us starts to burn
They'll break your will of pain
When you realise there's no return,
You have become their slave
Like nothing you have seen before
You'll loose your pride and face
Like nothing you have felt before
All you stood for can't remain
