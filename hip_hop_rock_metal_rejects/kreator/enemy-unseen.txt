So you think it's over now
There's one thing you forgot about
The voice inside your head gets loud
Chews you up and spits you out
Enemy Unseen
Out of the underground
Enemy unseen
Disorder all around
So you think it's over now
There's one thing you forgot about
This headrush you can't live without
Got to get rid of somehow
Enemy Unseen
Out of the underground
Enemy Unseen
Disorder all around
