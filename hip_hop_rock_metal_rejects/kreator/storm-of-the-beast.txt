5:01
Fog is coming down
Darkness all around
The beast is leaving it's
Bloody home
The smell of death
Is in the air
People die
If he wants the throne
And they fall down, down down to their knees
Mercy is a word he doesn't know
Storm of the beast yeah
Lock your doors
Don't get out
The beast brings death l
Like a game
He bursts heads
Thrashes all down
He destroys
And feels ever the same
