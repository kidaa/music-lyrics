The video shoot in Greece for this song was pretty
adventurous. We had planned to film in front of the
Akropolis but could not get an official permission, so we
did it without. Especially our Greek fans liked this song
very much and the audience's reaction each time we played
Athens was mindblowing.
This is a song which I use to describe what I feel
About people like you
No sense for humanity, no idea about life
The premise has been proved
You used my trust to satisfy your brainless lust
Your word isn't worth more than pulse in the dust
Betrayer
Betrayer
Misleader, you twisted things to satisfy
Deceiver, this greedy lust you can't deny
How could I be so naive to believe all the lies
You so easily told
I think I've learned my lesson too late
The story took time to unfold
Now I see your true face
Behind your mask, a cheat, a fake
Your word isn't worth more
than a puke in the dust
Betrayer
Betrayer
Ignorant twisted mind, maybe it would help
To think before you speak from time to time
Pretend to be a friend of mine
But you would sell your mother if you could
For less than a dime
Intelligence lost, brain deceased
So you will lose, fall to your knees
Guys like you I cannot stand
Maybe I must speak another language
Before you understand
Betrayer
