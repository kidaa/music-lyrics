Overreaction and you've lost your path
Faceless and hateful, emotional psychopath
Overreaction now you're not the same
Become someone else, hate becomes Alive Again
Alive Again, Overreaction
Search for what you need
Cause for a conflict
Schitzophrenic personality
Overreaction, will this ever change?
Reality fades, hate becomes Alive Again
Alive Again
In my wildest dreams you are mine
And your weakest spot i will find
I am not affriad to let it rise
Let me overrun your mind
Come walk with me, have no fear
And when you at least expect it it appears
It lingers on my favourite game
No matter how it comes Alive Again
