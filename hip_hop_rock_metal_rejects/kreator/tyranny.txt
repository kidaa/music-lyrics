Have been down for much too long bitter taste of this
Time, getting sick and tired about the way things are
So tell me where is all the peace of mind that i could
Never find, never wanted what you offered me at all
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you believe in
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you believe
Give me, give me, give me
Something to believe in
Give me, give me, give me
Something to believe
Have been broken much too long with a heart of anger
I could never understand what you became so tell me
Where is your heaven on earth that i could never find
Maybe i am just too blind to realize
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you believe in
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you believe
Give me, give me, give me
Something to believe in
Give me, give me, give me
Something to believe
Do you believe in pain
Do you believe in hate
This life it ain't for me
Your world it ain't for me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you believe in
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What do you believe
Give me, give me, give me
Something to believe in
Give me, give me, give me
Something to believe
