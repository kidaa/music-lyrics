All alone
So unreal
Follow illusions
Beyond imagination
All alone
Cannot breathe
Feelings isolated
All your heaven breeds frustration
Outcast
All alone
Is it real?
Killing illusions
Beyond imagination
All alone
Cannot feel
Absolute rejection
In a world with no reflection
Now you've crossed the line
See with different eyes
With a different mind, looking
Straight through your disguise
Do you ever know what it really means
Being pushed away
Driven to the last extreme
All you'll ever be, all you ever were
Nothing but a freak, just a sociopath
Outcast
