Indication of the essence
Concentrating on mass submission
Crying race philosophy
Sacramental confidence
Discovered desire
Hesitant intelligence
Impersonate integrity
Aging trauma from the past
Depending on naivety
Personified tyranny
Seeds of distorted thoughts
Planted into the brains of us all
Burn the brain
In this cold world, we go on
Our generation
Won't support this system anymore
Panic spreads among the victims
Driven to absurd copulation
Magnetism leaves them passive
Sceptical towards awareness
Serial misfortune
Seeds of distorted thoughts
Planted into the brains of us all
