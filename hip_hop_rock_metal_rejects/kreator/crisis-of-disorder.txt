4:18
Searching - for reality to hold on to
Probia - detonation without cause
Terror - out of traumatic reaction
Raging - symptom of a shattered past
Restless soul on fire
Schizophrenic grace
Intense destructive energy
Infectious like the plague
Obsessive devastation
Possession of your brain
Suicidal subversive power
Constant crisis of disorder
Deeper - neurotic conflict inside
Freezin - cold excessive force
Empty - personality's mutating
Slowly - self destructive systematic
Damage of identity, derangement
Paranoid, depression
Past life trauma, tyrany
Emptiness is shining in your eyes
Repeat first verse
