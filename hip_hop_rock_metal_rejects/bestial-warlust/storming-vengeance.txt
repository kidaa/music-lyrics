I am the vengeance, I am the hate
We are the demons, that are storming heavens gate
Attack, charge, kill
Bring down the walls
Burn down the crosses
Make the women whores
We bring blood to the streets, and death to the peace
Burn down their laws, and tear down their Gods
Attack the pearly gates
Smash them to the ground
Tear down their thrones
Bring the Gods down
The flames of burning churches
Lights a brave new world
But still there is war, and their helter helter
And still there is blood, cos we bring helter skelter
War storming vengeance
Stormtrooping hate
Skull fucking violence
Violent fucking hate
Repeat Chorus
Repeat 1st Verse
Attack, Charge, Kill
Bring down the walls
Burn down the crosses
Make them fucking ours
We Bring blood to the streets, and death to the peace
Burn down their laws, and tear down their Gods
Attack the pearly gates
Smash them to the ground
Tear down their thrones
Bring the Gods down
