Looking down upon a planet
Engulfed in weak morals
I laugh in demise
As I stare through unjust eyes
I am like the ocean
At day my moods wander in depths unknown
The land is my battlefield
And all you sheep my prey
At nightfall my waves
Destroy your futile race
When you run I?ll remain unseen
When you sweat
My hunger grows stronger
The land is my battlefield
And all you sheep my prey
You mundane fool your life is mine,
Before your pitiful tears touch the earth
Your children will learn to be warriors
On the land soiled by their parents blood
If I had the power
I would take all your
Souls through a catalyst
And incarnate you all
One by one
Into your messiah
And crucify all you fuckers!!!
The land is my battlefield
And all you sheep my prey
