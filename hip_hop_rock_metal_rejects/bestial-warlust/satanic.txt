I am the one who?ll face the end of the world
I will charge my horse on through death
I am the one who must watch the sun die
And await the coming of darkness
My spirit flies at the devils throne
As a wolf to its prey
I have come to take the devils anger
And his knowledge gained
To take what is ours
I will tear at the gates of heaven
And burn the angels of peace
I will kill the slut called hope
And fuck her piece by piece
And if you live through armageddon
And I hope you fucking don?t
I?ll hunt you down like a pig
And eat your fucking throat
I will spill your blood
To the new harvest moon
And release your blood
To the mother earth
