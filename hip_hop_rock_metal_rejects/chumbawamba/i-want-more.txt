Blue-rinse sugar
Wipe-clean couple
Pinched last supper
Counting pretty penny
John Betjeman
Some dead liar
Quiet pink picture
Under heavy manners

This is Tearoom England
They'll kick your face in
So politely
This is Tearoom England
They'll kick your face in
Oh so nicely

I want more!
No hurry, so sorry, don't worry
No hurry, so sorry, don't worry
I want more!

Bite-size china
Tea or tartar
Lipstick traces
Table set to bless
Sweet charity
Lukewarm whisper
Still-life platter
Under heavy manners

This is Tearoom England
They'll kick your face in
So politely
This is Tearoom England
They'll kick your face in
Oh so nicely

I want more!

No hurry, so sorry, don't worry
I want more!
No hurry, so sorry, don't worry
I want more!

I want more!
