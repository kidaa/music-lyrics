This is the Goodship Lifestyle
All my friends jumped ship
I elect me the captain
This is the loneliest voyage
I've ever been on
Up in the crow's nest
Over there! I see land!
First mate There is no First Mate
This is the Goodship Lifestyle

Sail away from the world
Sail away from the world

So steer a course, a course for nowhere
And drop the anchor my little Empire
I'm going nowhere, I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere, I'm going nowhere

This is the Goodship Lifestyle
I fly my very own flag
TV dinners for one at the captain's table
Repel all boarders!
Draw the curtains tighter!
Where's the crew There is no crew
This is the Goodship Lifestyle

Sail away from the world
Sail away from the world

So steer a course, a course for nowhere
And drop the anchor, my little Empire
I'm going nowhere, I'm going nowhere
I'm going nowhere, I'm going nowhere
