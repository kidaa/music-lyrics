And every morning comes too soon
All your nights are sleepless
Poison arrows to ruin your tomorrows

Below suspicion
Cafes full of people dressed as spies
And all I know is guilt for being different

It's always raining stones
There's a killer in the home
In a small town
Everybody looks the same

There are unwritten rules
Unspoken words
Should I pack my fear and go

I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow

And every morning comes too soon
All your nights are sleepless
Poison arrows to ruin your tomorrows

There are unwritten rules
Unspoken words
Should I pack my fear and go

I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow
