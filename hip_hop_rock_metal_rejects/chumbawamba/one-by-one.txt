Pontius Pilate came to our town
Up to the dockyards to see the picket line
We asked him to help but he just turned around
He's the leader of the union now

Leader of the union
All of our questions he ignored
He washed his hands and he dreamed of his reward
A seat in the House of Lords

One by one, the ships come sailing in
One by one, the ships go sailing out

We live for words and die for words
Principles we can afford
When all our Brothers turn to Lords
Whose side are you on

You tell the world your hands are tied
History three times denied
A sea of changes three miles wide
Whose side are you on

One by one, the ships come sailing in
One by one, the ships go sailing out

This conspiracy of shame
Murder by some other name
Play up and play the game
Whose side are you on

If any ask us why we died
We tell them that our leaders lied
Sold us out down the riverside
Whose side are you on

One by one, the ships come sailing in
One by one, the ships go sailing out
