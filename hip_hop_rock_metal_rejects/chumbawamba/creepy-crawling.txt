What a wonderful world

A loose door-jam, a light left on
The oldest national lottery
Enter Johnny-Go-Darkly
Come to spoil my party
Smell of faces lingers
Echo of light fingers
Cold comfort blankets
Steeped in creeping anger

Flatfoot comes poking
Compounding my misery
Grinding pestle and mortar
Adding insult to injury
If only this, if only that,
If only in my guts
See my life before my eyes
Trampled underfoot

Creepy crawling, creepy crawling

All the creeps go creepy crawling
Same thing every night
How can stealing candy from a baby
Seem alright

Corvino, carrion crow
Skulking with his mobile
Slippery peat-bog eyes
Stick-on smiley smile
Small print like quicksand
Not a wooden leg to stand on
Sinking through my stomach
The ground beneath me gone

Free-fall, call Ophelia
Clutching at straw
Mixed with bloody feathers
From scruff of neck of crow
Johnny go! Johnny gone!
Too much drink in your tum-tum-tum
See this finger, see this thumb
See this fist and watch it come

Creepy crawling, creepy crawling

All the creeps go creepy crawling
Same thing every night
How can stealing candy from a baby
Seem alright
