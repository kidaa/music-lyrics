Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the end of our death. Amen.

No virgin me for I have sinned. I sold my soul for sex and gin. Go call a priest, all meek and mild, and tell him,  quot;Mary, no more a child quot;.

It's raining stones, it raining bile from the luxury of your denial. So I don't deny, I don't make do. I'll press alarms, place bets on truth.

BRIDGE:
I'm so up-and-down and I love what's not allowed. I was lost, now I see and now I'm growing old disgracefully.

CHORUS:
What ever happened to Mary What ever happened to Mary What ever happened to Mary What ever happened to...

I'll spit on floors and do my drugs. Spend every bill, get drunk on love. Wear next to nothing in the pouring rain, be bad example, and do it all again.

I'll be uncarefull, I'll cause such scenes and I'll never talk of used-to-be's. Tattoo my face, I won't go gray, be a dancing queen and grow old disgracefully.

I'm so up-and-down and I love what's not allowed. I was lost, now I see and now I'm growing old disgracefully.

CHORUS:

Mary, Mary, Mary quite contrary. Mary, Mary, Mary quite contrary. Mary, Mary, Mary quite contrary. Mary, Mary, Mary quite contrary.
