Symphony Of Destruction!

You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a God
Watch peoples heads
A'roll
A'roll
A'roll

Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction

Acting like a robot
It's metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head
Explodes
Explodes
Explodes

Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction

[Solos]

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Stands tall
Stands tall

Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction

Perkele!
