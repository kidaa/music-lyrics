Somebody's running after you
There are times I do the same
But I cannot stand the way you live

I cannot simply follow sweet

My mind is drowned in a sea of thoughts, my heart is bleeding
My mind is black I need no more, oh sister release me

And I always love what others hate - but I never give up faith
Out in their world I feel insane - at her eyes I'm dying to stare
And I always love what others hate - but I never give up faith
Give me a hug please do it now, sister never, never, never, never let me down

How much I adored your inviting eyes
How much I hated to see you cry
Your love I wanted once not now
Feeling strange enough you cannot understand
