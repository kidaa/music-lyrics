Sweet little words made for silence
Not so young, heartfelt love not heartache
Dark hair fall, catch in the wind
Light the way, the sight of a cold world

Kiss,
While your lips are still red
While hes still in silent rest
While bosom is still untouched
Unveiled on another hair
While the hands still without a tool
Drown into eyes while theyre still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

First day of love never comes back
Compassion, its powers never a wasted wrong
The violin, the poets hand
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care

Kiss,
While your lips are still red
While hes still in silent rest
While bosom is still untouched
Unveiled on another hair
While the hands still without a tool
Drown into eyes while theyre still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn



Kiss,
While your lips are still red
While hes still in silent rest
While bosom is still untouched
Unveiled on another hair
While the hands still without a tool
Drown into eyes while theyre still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn
