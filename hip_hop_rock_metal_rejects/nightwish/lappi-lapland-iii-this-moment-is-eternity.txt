Day possesses no law here
Where moon sheds the cold twilight
This moment is eternity

Land of beauty
Cold and cruel
Field chants echoing
Reflecting the melancholy

Trust the wind
Trust the fire
Call for the hermit
The hermit of the night

Land of raven
Land of bear
Land of eagle
And wolverine

Dismal are the mirrors of a wolf
