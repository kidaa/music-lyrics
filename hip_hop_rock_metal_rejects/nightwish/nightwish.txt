Oh, setting Sun,
Thy red rays maketh me cry.
They remind me of the one
Whose slumber wakes me in the sky.

The bridal bed awaits us both
After the landscape of death I have crossed.
Before my sorrows I must die,
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.

The voice of nightly winds has awakened me,
Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.
Beneath my dreams and wishes
I long for thy caresses.

The bridal bed awaits us both,
After the landscape of death I have crossed.
Before my sorrows I must die,
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.

"Passed away in silence
The flute from the realm unseen
Empties its heart
Making love to me
With its enchanting melody.
Light of Orion,
Shadow of Andromeda,
Call of the dancing Universe.
The labyrinth I must enter
Before thou can blame my soul
With an age of peace"
