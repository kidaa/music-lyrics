The days were brighter
Gardens more blooming
The nights had more hope
In their silence The wild was calling
Wishes were whispering
The time was there
But without a meaning

Away, away in time
Every dreams a journey away
Away to a home away from care
Everywheres just a journey away

The days departed
Gardens deserted
This frail world
My only rest 
The wild calls no more
Wishes so hollow
The Barefoot Boy
weeping in an empty night

Away ...

Cherish the moment
Tower the skies
Dont let the dreamer
fade to grey like grass
No falling for life
A gain for every loss
Time gathered me
But kept me flying

  For this gift of dream I must pay the price
with the loss of lifes pleasures
