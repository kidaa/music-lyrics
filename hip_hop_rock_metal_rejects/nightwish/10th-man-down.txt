Today I killed, he was just a boy
Eight before him, I knew them all
In the fields a dying oath:
Id kill them all to save my own

Cut me free, Bleed with me, Oh no
One by one, We will fall, down down
Pull the plug, End the pain, Runn fight for life
Hold on tight, this aint my fight

Deliver me from this war
Its not for me its because of you
Devils instant my eternity
Obey to kill to save yourself

Cut me free ...

  I envy the 9 lives that gave me hell
My path made up by their torn bodies
Man to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dust
Call me a coward but I cant take it anymore  

They wait for me back home
The live with eyes turned away
They were the first ones to see
They are the last ones to bleed

  The ultimate high as all beautiful dies
A rulers tool, priests excuse, tyrants delight...
I alone, the great white hunter
Ill march till the dawn brings me rest
10th patriot at the gallows pole!  

Cut me free ...
