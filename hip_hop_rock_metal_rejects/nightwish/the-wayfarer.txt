I went into the wilderness with Uncle Walt
I discovered the wild
Learning to suck all the experience
Seeing the world through cradle's bars

The wild blessed me with an errant mind
Showing the way for the ultimate lore
I went around the world, beyond the wild
Finding my home from an ocean shore

Wayfarer, heartlander
What if I only had
One more night to live

Home is where the way is
My road goes on forever
One more voyage to go

Wayfarer, heartlander
What if I only had
One more night to live

Dead to the world
Alive for the journey

Wayfarer, heartlander
What if I only had
One more night to one more night to live

Wayfarer, heartlander
What if I only had
One more night to live


Home is where the way is
My road goes on forever
One more voyage to one more voyage one more voyage to go
