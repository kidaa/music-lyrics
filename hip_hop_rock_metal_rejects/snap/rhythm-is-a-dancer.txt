Chorus:
Rhythym is a dancer,
it's a soul's companion,
you can feel it everywhere

Lift your hands and voices
free your mind and join us
you can feel it in the air

Ooh, it's a passion
Ooh, you can feel it in the air
Ooh, it's a passion
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh

back to top of chorus

A far away light in the futuristic place we might be,
It's a tiny world just big enough to support the kingdom of one
knowledgeable,
throw away the loneliness and head back down,
I'm going too fast, I'm going too fast

back to top of chorus

I plunge right on through the office door,
and into the arms of the bottomless negro of love,
suddenly I can't remember,
how to stop, or turn around,

Do I have to get behind myself,
Do I have to turn around before I can point,
I flip 'til I can breathe
