I've got the power hey yeahheh
Like the crack of the whipI snap attack
Front to back in this thingcalled rap
Dig it like a shovel rhymedevil
On a heavenly level
Bang the bass turn up thetreble
Radical mind day and nightall the time
Seven to fourteen wise devine
Maniac brainiac winningthe game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohyeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohyeah
Gettin' kinda heavy
It's gettin' it's gettin'it's gettin' kinda heavy repeat three times

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heartof hearts repeat once
I've got the power oh-oh-oh-oh

It's gettin' it's gettin'it's gettin' kinda hectic repeat three times
Quality I possess somethingI'm fresh
When my voice goes throughthe rest
Of the microphone that I'mholdin'
Copywritten lyrics so theycan't be stolen
If they are snap
Don't need the police totry to save them
Your voice will sink soplease stay off my back
Or I will attack and youdon't want that

Like the crack of the whipI snap attack repeat verse one

I've got the power
