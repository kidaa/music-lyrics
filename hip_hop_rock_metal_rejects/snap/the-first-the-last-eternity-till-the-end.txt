Eternity eternity, eternity...

People all over the world
Listen to what I wanna say
Now I need all of your attention
Come dong with me
You don't have to worry
Couldn't use this longerway
I'm talking about the waythings cut it out
Gonna end that day

The first the last eternity
The first the last eternity
The first the last eternity

Eternity eternity, eternity...

Let's getting ready
For the final destiny
Gather all about your people
And come with me
I'm gonna be your good andyour angle
Oh,oh,on height
Come on come on it's time

The first the last eternity
As it's written it willalways be
Till the end of time
Do you here me
