When I was just seventeen I ran away from home
To be with all the pretty people
To be on my own
Bright lights and trains and bedsit stains
And pavements paved with gold
And I believed in everything that everybody told me
Have mercy
Have mercy upon me
I found myself in a lonely place with a suitcase full of dreams
and I soon grew up to realise what living in the doghouse means
But everyday I told myself good things would happen soon
'Cause I knew that I was going to be a legend in my living room
Have mercy
Have mercy upon me
Welcome to this perfect world
Now everyday on a dead end street is where I spend my time
The dust has been collecting on the corners of my mind
But I've shed my tears in bitter drops until the thorn trees bloomed
To take the spiky fruit to crown myself the Queen of doom
Have mercy
Have mercy upon me
