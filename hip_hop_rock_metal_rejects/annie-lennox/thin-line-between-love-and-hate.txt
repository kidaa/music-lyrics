*It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's five o'clock in the morning
And you're just getting in
A knock upon the door
A voice sweet and low says
who is it?
She opens up the door
And she lets you in
And never once does she say
";where have you been?";
She says,";Hold it,
Are you hungry,did you eat yet,
Let me hang up your coat now";
And all the time she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
And you dn't give it a second thought
*Repeat
The sweetest woman in the world
Could be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her be that way
She might be holding something in
That's really gonna hurt you
One of these fine days
There you are in the hospital
Bandaged from foot to head
In a state of shock
That much from bein' dead
You didn't think your woman
Could do something like that to you
You didn't think she'd got the nerve
Actions speak louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words,come on
Come on,baby,baby
If you won't give a damn about me
Come on baby,bay
You don't really care about me
Hear what I say
Hear what I say
