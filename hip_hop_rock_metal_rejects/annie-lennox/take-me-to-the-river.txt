Green/Hodges
I don't know why I love you like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money,my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
I wanna know,can you tell me
I'd really like to stay
*Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Wash me down,wash me down
Wash me down,wash me down
I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the thing that we could have had
Love is an ocean
And I can't forget my sweet sixteen
I'll never fret
I wanna know,can you tell me
I'd really like to stay
*Repeat
Love me,squeeze me
Love me,tease me
Till I can't,till I can't
Till I can't,till I can't-
I don't know why I love you like I do
All the trouble that you put me through
Sixteen candles blowin' on the wall
And here I am the biggest fool of all
I wanna know,can you tell me
I'd really like to stay
Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the water...
