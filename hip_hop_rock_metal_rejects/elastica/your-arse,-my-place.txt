[Justine: ";The big drum straight away, Jus...";]
1, 2, 3
I twist, you shout
I'm in, you're out
Too sharp, too flat
It's fate, and that's that
Get with it, baby
Bonjour, adieu
Can't win, with you
You're hard, i'm not
You're shit, shit hard
Get with it, baby
Cocaine, it's crack
Bloody, was black
I'm class, you're ace
Your arse, in my place
Get with it, baby
I like it like that
