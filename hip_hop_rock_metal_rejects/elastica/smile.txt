One, Two, Three, Four
Peaches and cream 
Where have you been ? 
Did you know I've been waiting all night ?
Whose bed were you in ? 
Whose head were you turning ?
Don't you know I've been out of my mind 
'Cos I know what you fear you will find 
Oh why... 
 Sweetness and light
I don't wanna fight you 
But I don't wanna listen to lies
Your face is a mess 
You know you should drink less 
I said I don't want to hear how time flies
'Cos I know from the look in your eyes 
You were talking to some girl 
Who'd seen you on her T.V. set
She said that she felt like she knew you
Although you'd only just met 
Oh yeah... 
 Don't stop talking shop
I'll see you down the time swap
I've been tested and tried 
Lost on the tide
So cold inside
Do you know I've been out of my mind 
'Cos I know what you fear you will find 
You were talking to some girl 
Who said that she'd seen you before
Oh my head's such a mess
'Till I hear your key in the door
Oh yeah...Oh yeah
