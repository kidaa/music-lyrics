I'm a sonic generator
It's as far as i can take it
Aren't you glad that i can make it
Oh oh in the money
Baby put your arms around me
Aren't you glad that you have found me
You want it? i've got it...
Oh oh on and on it
I'm a self taught regulator
Eeny meeny miney moaner
Catch a poet by the toga
You want it? i've got it
Oh oh on and on it
I'm a spastic generator
It's as far as i can take it
I was lying...
In all mat cocoa butter
Dead, dead in the water
I'm a third rate imitator
I'm a second hand fornicator
I'm a spastic generator
...see you later, alligator
