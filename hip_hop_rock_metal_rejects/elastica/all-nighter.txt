It's nearly eleven 
Do you think we'll stand the test of time 
You're a cloud short of heaven
But you know I want you to be mine 
Am I sitting here waiting 
Yeah, and it's getting frustrating
Got to go to the garage 
Got to get some fags and make some tea 
Can you lend me enough wedge 
Do you want to walk up there with me 
And I'm sitting here waiting 
Yeah, I'm tired of debating
 We've been up all night 
I can feel a strange attraction 
Now it's getting light 
But I can't spur you into action 
Sure not alone
But so on my own, oh. 
 It's a quarter to seven 
Don't you think we've stayed up half the night 
You're a cloud short of heaven
But I'd love to see you strut your stuff 
And I'm sitting here waiting 
Yeah, and it could be X-rated 
 We could be oh so happy, 
We could be oh so happy.
