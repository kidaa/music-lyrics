 Louder, louder 
 When you're stuck like glue 
When you need some goo 
 When you're stuck like glue, 
Vaseline 
When you're black and blue, 
Vaseline 
La la la la la la la la la la
 When you're stuck like glue, 
Give me some
 When you're stuck like glue 
If you'd like to woo,
Vaseline 
La la la la la la la la la la
 If it's hot like you, 
Give me some 
 Do you need a clue, 
I want some
Vaseline, Vaseline, Vaseline,
