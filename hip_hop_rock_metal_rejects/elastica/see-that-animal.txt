See that animal get some heavy metal 
Watch the world go singing sha-la-la-la 
White stick happiness, will we ever know how it feels, how it feels? 
I feel your tatoo on mine, but I can't wash it off this time 
Oh it's time, oh it's time, oh it's time, oh it's time. 
See that drug act, that AC/DC drag act on the wires in the sky tonight 
Fifteen new cities, but will we ever know how it feels, how it feels. 
I feel my tatoo on you, it's a sweet thing Terry, but it's not true 
It's not true, It's not true, It's not true, It's not true.
