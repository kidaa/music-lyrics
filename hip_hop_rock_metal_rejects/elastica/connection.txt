Riding on any wave
There is the luck you crave
They don't believe it now,
They just think it's stupid
So got anything ?
Anyone could have done
Who would've cared at all, not you 
 Another heart has made the trade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how a heart is a spade
But somehow the vital connection is made 
 Riding on anything
Anything's good enough
Who would've thought it of someone like you
Just as they brought me round
Now that they brought you down
Roundabout and roundabout 
Who wants a life anyone ? 
 Another heart has made the grade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how the last card is played
But somehow the vital connection is made
