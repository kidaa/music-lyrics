When i work all day
Just the way i like it
Sing a song with a subtle hand
When i need to spike it
And i'm living all right
And i'm doing ok
Had a lover who was made of sand
And the wind blew him away
But i've got a good idea..
Don't need to be right
Don't need to be wrong
Been torn with a subtle hand
That's why i sing this song
It's a rolling ride, oh yeah
That look in your eyes, oh no
Hold me with another hand
It'll be all right
