 Trio 
What you do and what you don't
What you will and what you won't
What you can and what you can't
This is what you got to know
Loved you though it didn't show
Ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht [4X]
da da da [4X]
Da da da, i don't love you, you don't love me [4X]
Da da da [4X]
I know why you went away
Understand you couldn't stay
Wonder where you are today
After all is said and done
It was right for you to run
Ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht [4X]
da da da [4X]
Da da da, i don't love you, you don't love me [4X]
Da da da [4X]
Da da da [4X]
