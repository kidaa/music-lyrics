John's gone his senses loaded over by your house it's so basic
One, two, three, four
 John's gone his senses loaded
Over by your house it's so basic
I think you're faking have a good time 
But don't get into my head. 
Do you recommend I wait a while
Direct and live or keep it constant 
And selective blue.
I can read your mind, 
If you want to 
I will let you blue. 
I can read your mind,
If you want to. 
 John's gone, he needs attention
Do you understand his inclination? 
I've seen you shaking, 
Come down here and I'll show you the wrong way 
Try to rearrange this tired old line 
Connect this smile and keep it standard
And reflective, blue
I can read your mind, 
If you want to 
I will let you blue. 
I can read your mind,
I will let you
If you want to.
