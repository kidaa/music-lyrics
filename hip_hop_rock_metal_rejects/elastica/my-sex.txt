What I want
Mornings to the winter and afternoons to the summer
What I want
Is for you to be waiting round the other side of every door
What I want
To walk through the wardrobe of other bodies we have known
What I want
Is fifteen minutes of you
What I want
A lover who loves me when others have loved me not
What I want
Is a big love, two spoons in a drawer, the master plan
What I want
A lover who can love me slowly
What I want
To make your heartbeat faster
What I want
Is a room with a three-bar fire, like the one you had before,
When you were poor and i just liked you more
What I want
To be in the park in the morning, the
Long shadows on the grass and the swans still asleep
What I want
Is to love you everywhere and everyhow
What I want
To kiss you until our lips are numb
What I want
Kiss you 'til everywhere hurts
What I want
Is to hear the rain against the window again
