I was only human
Of flesh and blood
I would relate to you
You know I could
I long to hold you
Just like you do
Ten times I've thought about it
The things you do
And so you see [them]
It's such a shame
It's just the way it goes
There is no pain
I long to hold you
Do what you would
Do dancing like you want to
You know I could
