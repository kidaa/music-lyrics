Misted eyes perceive
Thoughts I can't believe
Emotions that run free
Never let me be
Self-inflicted pain
It's a loss without a gain
Lost in myself, I know not why
I can't escape, all truth a lie
I try to run, I cannot hide
I'm so afraid, I'm terrified
Mirror's hollow stare
Reflecting my nightmare
All I see pure hate
Soon I'll suffocate
Confusion taking me
Eclipsing all I see
Lost in myself, I know not why
I can't escape, this fear inside
I cannot run, I cannot hide
Lost in myself, I'm terrified
Silent are the waters
Of life flowing free
Born through illusion
From the depths of me
Engulfed in the current
Of many tears
It carries me to serenity
To serenity...
