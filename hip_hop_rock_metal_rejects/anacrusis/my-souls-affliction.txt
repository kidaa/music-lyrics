Crashing in, down around my ears
Brow-beaten self for all these years
Enabling this suitable wall
I've been afraid of nothing at all
My soul's affliction will now amend
This ageless blight has come to an end
This silence, deafening
Kept inside, rages
This silence, deafening
Kept inside
Negotiate with my emotions
An inner wealth in such devotion
This genuine warmth has filled my heart
Mending, again, what was torn apart
This silence, deafening
Kept inside, rages
This silence, deafening
Kept inside
This silence, deafening
Kept inside, rages
This silence, deafening
Kept inside
Rages...
Rages...
