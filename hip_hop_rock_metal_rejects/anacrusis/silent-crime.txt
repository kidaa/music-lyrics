It's running rampant in our streets
It's lying dormant in our homes
This silent crime we are guilty of
Is enough to sentence us to life or death
It's running rampant in our streets
It's lying dormant in our homes
This silent crime we are guilty of
Is enough to sentence us to life or death
Deny the future
Reject technology
Protest advancement
And you'll shroud the world
In rags of failed ideals...
The fear of change has bound us all
Silent, we watch our world decay
And we'll return to the Dark Ages...
Again... again...
Deny the future
Reject technology
Protest advancement
And you'll shroud the world
In rags of failed ideals...
Stilt the growth and progress dies
Watch our once-spinning world stand still
And in this, the Age of Stagnation, we'll remain
Deny the future
Reject technology
Protest advancement
And you'll shroud the world
In rags of failed ideals...
