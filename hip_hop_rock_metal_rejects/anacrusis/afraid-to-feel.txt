I paint myself on you... the silent wall
My words... my thoughts... my touch... my all
Emotionless... emotionless
So in control of nothingness
This stone-false face you're caged within
Wears thin...
You pour yourself out into me... the lonely thirst
Quenching the emptiness within
But I frighten you... I frighten you...
I take your breath and smother you...
As you fight for your life...
I cling on for mine...
For mine...
So in control... so in control of nothingness
So in control... so in control... afraid to feel
I know you're there somewhere...
Too close to touch
I'm digging too deeply...
You're too clear to see
I frighten you... I frighten you...
I take your breath and smother you...
As you fight for your life...
I cling on for mine...
For mine...
