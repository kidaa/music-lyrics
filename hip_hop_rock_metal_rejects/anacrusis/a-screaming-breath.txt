Are we so brave?
Are we so bold
As to deny our hearts?
Are we so numb?
Are we so cold
As to defy our conscience?
Awkwardly, we walk alone
So distant and so uncaring
Deliberately we disguise ourselves
To protect our frail emotions
The ability to feel and be,
Somewhere in me,
Is longing to free...
This screaming breath
Breathe...
Selfishly, we retain and horde
Everything and yet, nothing at all
A poisoned soul can never soar
When bound by doubt and by fear
Awkwardly, we walk alone
So distant and so uncaring
Deliberately we disguise ourselves
To protect our frail emotions
The ability to feel and be,
Somewhere in me,
Is longing to free...
This screaming breath
Breathe...
Are we so brave?
Are we so bold
To hide from things we long to show
Are we so numb?
Are we so cold
As to lose the self to self-control?
The ability to feel and be,
Somewhere in me,
Is longing to free...
This screaming breath
Breathe...
