You wear
Like an enemy
A false sense of security
With your bullshit integrity
You'd lose it all for your dignity
And you tell yourself "You're so brave"
Yeah, fight for yours until your dead
Well there's plenty of that already filling holes
Before you use your fists, why don't you use your head?
Sometimes we're overcome by this child inside
We grow, and never grow inside
Well I play games I don't see
Accepting false hospitality
With kind words you disguise deceit
Yeah, I help you and you screw me
And somehow you think you fool someone
Surely someday this mask will fall
You find a strength in one on one
But there's something real in all for all
Sometimes we're overcome y the child inside
We grow, and never grow inside
And you tell yourself "You're so brave"
Yeah, fight for yours until your dead
Well there's plenty of that already filling holes
Before you use your fists, why don't you use your head?
Sometimes we're overcome by this child inside
We grow, and never grow inside
