They manipulate and they mold
The rules they should uphold
His ignorance of the law
Is the victim's only flaw
His rights in violation
Through sharp intimidation
He's soon to realize
That their words are full of lies
A scapegoat he now is
Because of the way he lives
He hasn't got a chance
To prove his innocence
People cry for justice
But the law will not take the heed
Innocent victims get the shaft
But what happened to truth?
Injustice for all
Coerced to pleading guilt
Their judgments all are built
On bullshit and hearsay
They'll keep him locked away
He rots inside his cage
His oppression and his rage
Now apathy and disgust
Not a soul he can trust
A scapegoat he now is
Because of the way he lives
He hasn't got a chance
To prove his innocence
People cry for justice
But the law will not take the heed
Innocent victims get the shaft
But what happened to truth?
Injustice for all
Injustice has subdued him
Deceived, repressed, unglued him
No one he can turn to
To wait is all he can do
Persecution obvious
Life becomes oblivious
Fate's found him unwary
He's trapped, he cannot flee
Injustice
Injustice
Injustice
Injustice for all
