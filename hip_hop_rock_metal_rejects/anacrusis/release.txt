For forever living in
For forever dying in
The shadow of a killing cross
Born and held accountable
Sworn to bear the burden, now
For sinful nails
Driven deep
But I can't be responsible
For having done the unthinkable
And won't...
No, I won't play that role
For forever living in
For forever dying in
The ashes of a smoldering cross
Born and held accountable
Sworn to bear the burden, now
For shameful hands
Which held the flame
But I can't be responsible
For changing the unchangeable
And won't...
Don't, to ourselves, we owe release?
With rusted chains
We incarcerate and cage ourselves
Cease
We patronize and crucify
And kill ourselves
We seduce the past
And draw it close
And hold it tight
And never let it go
Until we hurt ourselves
And hate ourselves
And blame ourselves again
Again...
No, we can't be responsible
For bearing the unbearable
And won't...
Don't, to ourselves, we owe release?
With rusted chains
We incarcerate and cage ourselves
Cease
We patronize and crucify
And kill ourselves
We seduce the past
And draw it close
And hold it tight
And never let it go
Until we hurt ourselves
And hate ourselves
And blame ourselves again
Again...
