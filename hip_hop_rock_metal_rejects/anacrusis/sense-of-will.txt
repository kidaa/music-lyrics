Creases in the depths of our existence
Without which, there can be no substance
These rifts and folds within our lives
Each day, a new disruption arrives
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
