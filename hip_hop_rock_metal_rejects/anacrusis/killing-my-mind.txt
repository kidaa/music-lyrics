Aware, yet unaware. Falling, falling, why?
Blind! Ignorance the key, stupidity overrides
My thoughts belong to me, although my mind rebels
Reality, shaded meaning, denial is my cell
Killing my mind
Victimize my own belief
Defy myself! Find no relief
Obtrusive walls cannot reveal
Cast out myself and all I feel
My eyes refuse to se all I must endure
Revealing walls of doubt, reality so obscure
Searching, I'm searching, it's one who's deep within
Beside myself I stand and now I must begin
Killing my mind
Victimize my own belief
Defy myself! Find no relief
Obtrusive walls cannot reveal
Cast out myself and all I feel
The self inside is so sincere
Avoid the truth, the honest fear
Intensify all that remains
Bind it now with self restraints
Victimize my own belief
Defy myself! Find no relief
Obtrusive walls cannot reveal
Cast out myself and all I feel
