I remember the lost confusion of innocence
With feelings worn so clean
I wish I could look on this with different eyes
And ignore the blinders reminding me
Older...
Wiser...
Sadder...
Trust has abandoned me long ago
Stolen by careful dishonesty
I have forgotten how...
I have forgotten how...
I have forgotten how... How to believe
Stop me from loving to destroy
Stop me from destroying all I love
Stop me from loving to destroy
Stop me...
The pain has stripped away all rationale
And left suspicion in its place
I wish I could cling to this with different arms
And never know the feeling of loss or emptiness
Older...
Wiser...
Sadder...
Trust has abandoned me long ago
Stolen by careful dishonesty
I have forgotten how...
I have forgotten how...
I have forgotten how... How to believe
Stop me from loving to destroy
Stop me from destroying all I love
Stop me from loving to destroy
Stop me...
The death of youth breathes life into this fear
Suffocating confidence
I die each day so I can save myself
Close my eyes, ignore the truth, and try hard to pretend
So afraid... so afraid... so afriad... of myself...
Stop me... stop me... stop me... what's wrong with me?
Stop me...
What's wrong with me?
