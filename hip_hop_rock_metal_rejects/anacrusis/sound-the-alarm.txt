Lie to me honestly
I hear, but still, I don't see
Just where the actions meet the words
You just sound the alarm
Racing pulse and boiling blood
At fever-pitch
Another finger-pointing mob
With stones to throw
But if it truly mattered
And if you truly cared
It would be altogether different
Let the sirens scream
But leave me alone to decide
And leave me to what I might find
Starving to understand
You swallowed the lies
Eager to spit them out
To feed the masses
And the guilt they hide
Answer me honestly
No more false transparencies
Just where does motive meet concern?
You just sound the alarm
Spreading fear to bury trust
To distract
Until, lost and scared
Frustration forces blame
Starving to understand
You swallowed the lies
Eager to spit them out
To feed the masses
And the guilt they hide
Answer me honestly
No more false transparencies
Just where does motive meet concern?
You just sound the alarm
Spreading fear to bury trust
To distract
Until, lost and scared
Frustration forces blame
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!
Starving to understand
You swallowed the lies
Choking to spit them out
To rid this guilt inside
