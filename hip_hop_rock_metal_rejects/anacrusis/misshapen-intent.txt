Wandering aimlessly
Stricken with grief
Self-hatred overflowing
It's eating away
It's eating away
Obstructing virtue
Overwhelming and growing
The enduring might of hatred
Obscuring the strength of love
There are some who live deriving pleasure
From others' anguish
And mental distress
Complete selfishness
Provides a purpose
Compelling us to digress
The enduring might of hatred
Obscuring the strength of love
Tainting the innocent
With spiteful contempt
Tainting the innocent
A shallow, misshapen intent
Oblivious to our hardship
Rehearse the solemn ritual
Oblivious to our hardship
Rehearse the solemn ritual
Wandering aimlessly
Stricken with grief
Self-hatred overflowing
It's eating away
It's eating away
Obstructing virtue
Overwhelming and growing
The enduring might of hatred
Obscuring the strength of love
Tainting the innocent
With spiteful contempt
Tainting the innocent
A shallow, misshapen intent
