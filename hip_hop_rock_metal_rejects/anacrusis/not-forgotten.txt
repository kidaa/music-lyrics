Your ambition has been disrupted
Young minds so easily corrupted
The system is fighting itself
A fatal blow shall be dealt
Thrown into the tide of uncertainty
Have your dreams smashed completely
The norm dictates your future for you
Hopelessness and despair
Face the grim reality
Individual concerns
Eclipse the world's humanity
Corruption won't dissipate
It's standing in your path
Our leaders chase their tails
Frightened by subversive wrath
Thrown into the tide of uncertainty
Have your dreams smashed completely
The norm dictates your future for you
Hopelessness and despair
Face the grim reality
Individual concerns
Eclipse the world's humanity
Redemption is at hand
Your scheme has taken form
We will take the final step
And instigate reform
Thrown into the tide of uncertainty
Have your dreams smashed completely
The norm dictates your future for you
Hopelessness and despair
Face the grim reality
Individual concerns
Eclipse the world's humanity
Looking the other way
Solves nothing of our problems
Take the step and unite
Tomorrow will not be forgotten
Tomorrow will not be forgotten
