A trippy hipster,
in another time,
sang that  Love is All Around  -
which sounded
pretty ridiculous
to a kid who shilled for the house.

I ll tell you a secret
but keep it under your hat:
Two s a crowd when you re
born to slip through the cracks.

The first decades of life
rained on my hide
and cured me from lies.
Then, ever after,
spoke through my  caster
and pushed misfortune aside.

I ll tell you a secret
but keep it under your hat:
It ain t worth facin  a day
when you re livin  like that.

I ll tell you a secret
but keep it under your hat:
There ain t no future
in wrestling with your past.
