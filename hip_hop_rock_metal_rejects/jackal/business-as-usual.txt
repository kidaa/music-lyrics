Well, it is such a useless waste
filing all those folks away
but its business as usual, today.

See, they were tryin  to get over
on a market that s been cornered
carved by ol  Joe Kennedy, and his like.

It doesn t have to be this way,
the stigma s built to tilt the play.
It doesn t have to be that way.

Between Lorrilard and Escobar
the difference is who writes the laws
when genocide s a racket in itself.

There is no debt to be fulfilled
by making people criminals
and turning loose the damned instead.

The competition
is made the villain.
This market s covered
by bad muthas.

It doesn t have to be this way.
I hope I m free to see the day
when business ain t so usual - one day.
