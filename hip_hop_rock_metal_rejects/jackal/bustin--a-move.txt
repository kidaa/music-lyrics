Slow down, there s just one truth here that counts -
Flat out, you re in to me, yeah, you re bound.

Been givin  it  up, babe,
givin  it up for you.
Bustin  a move where
angels fear to tread.

Our town s too small to hide in the crowd.
Profound - how deep a debt can compound.

Been givin  it  up, babe,
givin  it up for you.
Bustin  a move where
angels fear to tread.

I give you more
with my left hand
than your army of Homer Simpsons.

The time we spend
horizontal s so bland
it makes me wish I was back
in prison.

Bustin  a move
Bustin  a move
Bustin  a move on you.
Just watch me turn the screw.
I think I ll toy with you.
