No time to spare,
knife the air, kids beware.

Fight off a fit,
loose my bit, catch my wits.

Alone at last.
Refuge  from the smoke and gin,
time to check what s left within.
Finally, alone at last.

Not built to bow,
serve no one, live for Now.

Part with the past,
hoist a glass, shake some ass.

Live my days with the night hangin  over my head.
A drunk I d tossed was a  round tripper  sportin  lead.
For all this trouble, you d think I d be livin  large.
Yet, there ain t no dough to fetch my bomb back from the garage.

Alone at last.
Just in  time before I blow.
Latch the door, ascend my throne.
Finally, alone at last.
