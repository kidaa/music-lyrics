As the delta mines its run,
there s no one source, there s just the sum
of masters, slaves.

The laying bare of tortured souls.
A lonely wail, sensuous moan.
Sober, stoned.

Once upon a time
my fascination grew.
I found myself at the foot
of a Blue Pyramid.

Tucked within the mountain s robes
are Jazz and Country, Rock and Soul.
Hip Hop, Doo Wop.

Timeless tones of gold
haunt a lost plateau.
There is no turning back
on the Blue Pyramid.

Its power and magic grow
in echos, new and old.
Never may it peak -
the Blue Pyramid .
