Evil twin sisters,
why you comin  on so strong?
I ve lost my freedom
from bein  down with you so long.

Don t want to spend my life with you.
but what else have I got left to do?

Evil twin sisters,
workin  on me night and day.
Sunrise and sunset
wandering your spiral caves.

No time to rest, nowhere to move
too tired to keep away from you.
