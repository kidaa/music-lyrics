I was born lucky, got to be that Jupiter trine.
Fate s baddest angels crackin  up at all of my lies.

Curled on my carpet,
I bank and I glide.
The ultimate trip,
One dynamite ride.

Everything s sexy,
a bump and a grind.
Heaven s on Earth -
that blows my mind.

Kindness surrounds and compensates when I am blind.
A hand reaches down and rights me when I m gonna slide.

No need to rush and join the troops.
Hope offers amnesty for fools -
why would I refuse?

I ve been down before,
I ll be down again.
Rhythm finds me  fore
trouble closes in.

I ve been down before,
I ll be down again.
Angels guiding me
to my righteous end.

But that s all right,
Whoa, yeah!

In fact it s out-a-sight!
