I ve been pounding
the same beat
so long my feet 
engraved the street.

Have a cigar!
Have a cigar!
A nice cigar -
A thick cigar.

Said I know of what I speak,
so I walk.
I walk on.

Ten years more,
ten years less,
I won t bite the hand
that raised me up from the dead.

Have a cigar!
Have a cigar!
A nice cigar -
A pink cigar.

Said I know of what I speak,
so I walk.
I walk on.

Well, I ve known which way
the wind would blow,
but there ain t no carrot to dangle
in front of my nose.
Cause I do what I like
and I like what I do -
I d rather flip burgers
than turn from the blues.
