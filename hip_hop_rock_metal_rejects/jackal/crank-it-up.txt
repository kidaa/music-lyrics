Pipes comin  nitrous as I distance my lair,
no drunk bump s raggin  can contain this affair.
See, I m sweatin  faster than the sky can absorb.
My eyes are buggin  like a cesspool frog.
Crank it up!

Lunch don t appeal once I m feeling the flow
I ain t in the mood to break and spark up a bowl.
The sun rakes the blacktop  till she wriggles and smokes -
if I don t stop soon, gonna burn my nose.
Crank it up!

Time s flyin  by as I reel in the miles,
my front end s shakin s put my speedo on trial.
My pulse keeps a knockin  past the redline zone,
this white knuckle day s done rattled my bones.
Crank it up!
