My dear wife, seems my life is over
without you 
I dream of you  in every glacial night,
that I'm alone
You're so far away from the thundering guns 
round my head - so far
I feel your tears
Dropping slowly down on my skin
I can taste your lips on mine
Let me kiss you before I must die
Oh, my love, what has been done to us?
Or was there anything - I could have done?
Your tears are the ocean, 
that spends love and hope and faith - 
for my wounded heart - to heal
I feel your tears
Drying away off my skin
The shine within your eyes
Will soon enlighten my night
But still I'm fighting
But still I'm bleeding
See their dying eyes and suffering
OH my love, I need to kill
Believe in me, I promise you,
I soon will close my arms around you
But still I'm killing
And still I'm bleeding
I suppose to see, there's nothing real
The answer might once be found in me
