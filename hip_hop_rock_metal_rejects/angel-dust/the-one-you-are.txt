Slip into my outfit
Dress up like it shall be
I'm correct, I'm an ideal
There are thousands to be led
I see devine visions
We'll rise as high as the sky
I look into the mirror
Is this my face I see?
I'm deeply involved into
A brand new hast - and I hear him say:
Break the chains that tie you down
And be again the one you are
Lift the weakness off your heart
And be again the one you are
You?re like the rolling thunder
Your heart is made of steel
Undefeated on the field of honour
I believe, he is holy
Electrifying each and every soul
Oh my dear husband, open your frozen heart
I miss so much of you, where has all your love gone?
And she says:
Break the chains that tie your soul
And be againt the one you are
Lift the shadows off your heart
And be again the one you are
Are you still the loving father
Your children can look up to?
Open your heart again for humanity
