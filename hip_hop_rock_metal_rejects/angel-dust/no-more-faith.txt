How do you feel, do you feel real good?
Well, I do not believe
Cos you seem to be someone else
Than you pretend to be
Something crept into your mind
Nimble as a snake
It sells you shit for truth
And you'll never recognice
No more .......
Do you wonder all the pain
That is hidden within steel
I'll tell you for nothing
You only fear yourself
No more ................. no more faith
Love or hatred
Pain or pleasure
No escape from your sentimental  treasures
Better face the truth
All the money that you spend
For beautycreams and masks
Will never ever hide the scars
That lies left on your face
No more .................. no more faith
No more .................. no more faith
