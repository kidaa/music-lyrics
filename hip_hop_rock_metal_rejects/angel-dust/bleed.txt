Frightened Shadows
Appear behind the light
And the coldness seizes me
A paralyzing pain catches me again
Can anybody tell me what's going on
Another day is over
see horror on the screen
The shadows gonna
touch my heart
A skeleton hand
that bears all the grief
Does lightly stroke my sleeping emphaty
Can I leave and close my eyes
for one more night
Can I pay to be set free
of all this pain
That makes me bleed
Gotta meet the pries
and ask for his help
Will the collection
heal my soul
Can money clear the temple
of prejudice and lies
Can I reach heaven and enter paradise
Chorus
Love and faith
Future and hope
Never appear in their lives
Has all guilt been payed
by the death of christ
Or is there something to apologize
Chorus
