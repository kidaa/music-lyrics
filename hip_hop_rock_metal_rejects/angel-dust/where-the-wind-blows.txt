Try to keep the distance,
Since you threw my life away
My courage into pieces
I couldn?t make you stay
Hate, pain and tears
Life can be a tragedy
Dreams becoming nightmares,
Some visions left behind
What could have been,
What cold have last?
You're always on my mind
Love, joy and laughter,
Life can be a miracle
And my heart made of steel,
But my soul turns to stone
And I'm going where no one goes
I carry my load, I'm walking alone
I'm crying, where the wind blows
Lovers score and lovers fail,
Here ain't no compromise
Back to back and face the future
It's a devil in disguise
Fear, darkness and vain
Life can be a deadly maze
And my heart made of steel,
But my soul turns to stone
And I'm going where no one goes
I carry my load, I'm walking alone
I'm crying, where the wind blows
