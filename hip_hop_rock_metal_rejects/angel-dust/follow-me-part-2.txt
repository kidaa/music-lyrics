Hate - memories tear me apart
Live - never thougt it wold be that hard
Time - always knew on my side
Death - seems to be the only bride
'Cause you didn't follow me
'Cause you didn't follow me
Love - a never unknown feeling I lost
Pain - I never thought I'd count the cost
Feel - you finally made me loose it
Mind - I think you gotta prove me
Chorus
Somebody to catch my fall
Somebody to close the distance
In my circle of tragedy
Somebody to share my sorrow
Somebody who I believe in
Somebody to follow me
Do you remember - a walk along the river
In the valley of our dreams
The other side of pain is rising high again
And makes me cry
Chorus
Forgotten problems they've darkened
the horizon
Life's no more what it seems
The other side of pain is rising high again
And makes me cry
Chorus
