Here I am - back from nowhere
I don't remember - everything
I've gone too far
There ain?t nothing left
It started so softly -
Couldn't feel anything at all
Ther was no euphoria -
Reality was so close
Then fellows and me -
We tripped day by day
To visit the new world -
For the old did decay ...
My soul's flown away -
Left an empty space
I took a view into hell -
But I'm coming home
Slave me ...
Mother - please believe me
I never want you to die
Father, forgive me
Your memory lives in me
My soul's flown away -
Left an empty space
I took a view into hell -
But I'm coming back alive ...
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Please believe me
I`m coming home
Deliver me ...
