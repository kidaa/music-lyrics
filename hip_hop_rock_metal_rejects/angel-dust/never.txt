Horror in my eyes
I don't know whats going on
List in hell
Nothing remains the same
Creatures of the night
arise in me
Darkness around me
Encourages their evil deeds
I feel my mind
is leaving me
I will follow into eternity
A light shines on me
I feel the sun arise
Fire will banish my fear
My dreadful
black dreams
No longer they'll
scare me
Until the night returns
How long can I stand
The return of
the eternal curse
Deliver me of all the pain
The fear of the dusk
paralyses me
Bridge
Chours
Black is the jail of my soul
In my haunted nights
Chorus
