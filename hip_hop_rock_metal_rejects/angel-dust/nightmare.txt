Listen my children,
Listen wat your lord's gonna say
I hear you praying me day by day
I know that you believe in me, the only truth
You're the deciples of knowledge
All elder and youth
And I will eat up your minds
And swollow your souls
There ain't no escape
From the mechanical claws
I'm just your only nightmare
Etched in your mind
I'm just your only nightmare
And I'll be back night after night
Listen everyone
To what your lord's gotta say
There ain't no sinners
You all know waht is to do
And I'll will eat up your minds
And swollow your souls
There aint't no escape
From the mechanical claws
I'm just your only nightmare
Etched in your minds
I'm just your only nightmare
And i will come bach - every night
