Do you remember -
a walk along the river
In the valley of our dreams
Forgotten problems -
they've darkened the horizon
Life's no more what it seems
The other side of pain
is rising high again
And makes me cry
So why don't you follow me?
Why don't you follow me?
Forgotten promises -
just flow within the water
Rememberance - just fades away
Echoes of a perfect love
Hurt just like a force
from high above
Chorus
Times are changing -
life has just begun
There are new aims to be found
Different valleys
Sweeter dreams
Now I know new love
I found my way
Chorus
