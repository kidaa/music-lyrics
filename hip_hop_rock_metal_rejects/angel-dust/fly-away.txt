For me and I
Live seems so hard at all
Not evenworth a dime
Need to do some kind of crime
I'm looking up
To a high command
But watching you tears me in two
To sell myself I got to do
There's no return now
If I want to go my way
To leave this life of a dying man
I would sell my soul to anyone
Here I am, an eternal slave
I will do what you like
I will be at your side - I'm allright
I would die to be your friend
Fly away to the other side
Fly away to the point of entry
Fly away to what?s so high above
Will you establish me
In your company?
Oh please
I'll be forever yours
Seems I am none, but I'm sure I'll be one
There's a place for me too
