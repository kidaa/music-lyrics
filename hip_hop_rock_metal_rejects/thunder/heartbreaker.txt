They say that I'm a bad boy
That I just can't help myself
That even though I know I should
I'm just too bad to be good

They call me a romancer,
A chancer, a gigolo
Who'll always have an alibi
Who'll kiss the girls and make them cry

[Chorus:]
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart in two
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry, but it's what I seem to do
They call me a heartbreaker
Nothing, but a heartbreaker

They say I'm the dark destroyer
That I just can't get enough
Of girls hanging on a string
That I'm only after one thing

That I'm filled with desire
A liar, a Romeo
Like a bee in a honey comb
Welcome to the pleasure dome!

[Chorus]

[Cello Solo]

I just can't live without it
The thrill of a woman's touch
It's written in the stars above
I'm just addicted to love

But they all want to train me
To chain me and tie me down
Don't they know I was born to be
Footloose and fancy-free

[Chorus]
