Sure you ride the finest horse I've ever seen
Standing 16' one or two, with eyes wild and green
You ride the horse so well, hands light to the touch
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

Ride on, see you,
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

When you ride into the night, without a trace behind
Run you claw along my gut, one last time
I turn to face an empty space, where you used to lie
I look for the spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in your eye

Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no 
matter how I wanted to

I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
