I am a sailor, you're my first mate
We signed on together, we coupled our fate
We hauled up our anchor, determined not to fail
For the hearts treasure, together we set sail

With no maps to guide us we steered our own course
We rode out the storms when the winds were gale force
We sat out the doldrums in patience, and hope
Working together, we learned how to cope

Life is an ocean, love is a boat
In troubled waters, it keeps us afloat
When we started the voyage, there was just me and you
Now gathered round us, we have our own crew

Together we're in this relationship
We built it with care, to last the whole trip
Our true destination's not marked on any charts
We're navigating for the shores of the heart

Life is an ocean and love is a boat
In troubled waters, it keeps us afloat
When we started the voyage, there was just me and you
Now gathered round us, we have our own crew
