So see the leaves fall to the ground,
And see them lyin' all around, 
'Cos still I can't see you, 
And there's the wind that plays in the air, 
Flying around, how it does not care 
Still I can't see you

And the seasons pass away
And I still sit here lonely, each and every day,
Wonderin' what's gone wrong.
'Cos I don't remember seasons lastin' oh so long
Oh so long.

And I still can't see you
I'm dreamin' every night, I'm searchin' every day
And I still can't see you
I had her in my sights, and let her slip away
And I still can't see you
Lauren and I 
Lauren and I

And there's the stars way in the sky
Leading my way and I don't know where or why
Still I can't see you.
And when my back's against the wall
I see a reason for it all 
But I still can't see you

And I still can't see you
I'm dreamin' every night, I'm searchin' every day
And I still can't see you
I had her in my sights, and let her slip away
And I still can't see you
Lauren and I 
Lauren and I
Lauren and I
Lauren and I
