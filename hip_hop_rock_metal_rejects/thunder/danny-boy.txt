Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
Tis you, tis you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy I love you so
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy I love you so
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy I love you so
