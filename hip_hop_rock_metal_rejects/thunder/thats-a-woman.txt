[Paul:]
Woman
Such a delicate creature
Every feature needs to be loved from the start
Be tender and she'll surrender
Offend her, and she will harden her heart

[Ryan:]
Delicate creature is something she ain't
Better take it from me that's a woman
That isn't an angel that isn't a saint
Better take it from me that's a woman
She knows how to please and she knows how to play
Take it from me that's a woman
Forget to honor, love and obey
She'll take you and break you and throw you away
That's a woman, that's a woman

She knows every rule and she knows every trick
Take it from me that's a woman
How to kill with a word and cut to the quick
Take it from me that's a woman
How to look through you as if you're not there
Take it from me that's a woman
How to say no with a flick of her hair
She'll turn you and burn you and not even care
That's a woman that's a woman

[Paul:]
Faithful and true, that's a woman
Trusting in you, that's a woman
Gentle and constantly caring
Strong as the love she is sharing
When you look in the eyes of a woman

[Ryan:]
Look in her eyes you'll see nothing but lies, she's a woman

[Paul:]
And through the disguise of a woman

[Ryan:]
Every word is the same, she's just playing a game, she's a woman

[Paul:]
You'll see it all there, there's so much in the air

[Both:]
Nothing else can compare, that's a woman

[Paul:]
Woman, so soft and beguiling
See her smiling and feel your heart all aglow
Enfold her, lay her head on your shoulder
And hold her till you just can't let her go

[Ryan:]
Treat her as if you just don't give a damn
That's how to handle a woman
Be more of a stallion, less of a lamb
That's how to handle a woman
Keep her hanging around til she's ready to burst
That's how to handle a woman
Don't try to be bad, be the worst
Do unto others but just do it first
To a woman, to a woman

Be wise, be wary and be on your guard
That's how to handle a woman
If you feel like your falling you'd better be hard
Cause that's how to handle a woman
Don't let her get closer and don't let her in
That's how to handle a woman
Cause if you allow her get under your skin
My friend that's the end cause you ain't gonna win with a woman, with a woman

[Zara Curtis:] Dances to him with Hard Shoe taps as a challenge

[Ryan:]
Look at her body and look at her move, now that's what I call a woman

[Zara Curtis:] Dances to him with Hard Shoe taps as a challenge

[Ryan:]
I'm thinking now I've got something to prove cause that's what I call a woman

[Zara Curtis:] Dances to him with Hard Shoe taps as a challenge

[Ryan:]
All my moves are stolen here, I can't get through to this woman
The pipes the pipes are calling here, I think I could be falling here for this woman
What a woman!!

[Paul:]
Faithful and true that's a woman

[Ryan:]
She couldn't be true, she's just playing with you, what a woman

[Paul:]
Trusting in you, that's a woman

[Paul:]
Trusting in who, you just haven't a clue, what a woman

[Paul:]
Gentle and constantly caring

[Ryan:]
Just let her be, this one's for me, what a woman

[Paul:]
Strong as the love she is sharing

[Both:]
When you look in the eyes of a woman
And through the disguise of a woman
You'll see it all there
There's so much in the air
Nothing else can compare,
That's a woman

[Ryan:]
Who'd ever thought I'd ever get caught

[Both:]
What a woman!
