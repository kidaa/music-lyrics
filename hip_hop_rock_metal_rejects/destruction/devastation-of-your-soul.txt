You wake up in a pool of blood
You can't remember that you'd cut -
Human beings into pieces
Of dead meat and disgusting guts!
Of course they don't deserve to live
But who are you that you decide
Which life will get swallowed
From the eternal jaws of death!
Despair - pain
Despair leads to hate
Pain causes fear
Try - to forget
Time - will not heal
Resign - deep inside
Devastation of your
Soul - don't forget
Time - will not heal
Resign - deep inside
Devastation of your soul ...
The reason for your cruel deeds
Are not relevant in a world of creeps
They play the game of the dying,
In a world that's crying
Kill or be killed will be the commandment of our
Dirty rotten breed
The death penalty for humanity in world of greed!
