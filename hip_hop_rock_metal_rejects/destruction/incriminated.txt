It began about half a century ago
with the foundation of the hopeless empire of 1000 years
Commanded by a ruler of cruelty
a nation captivated by idealism
Why do we take the reponsibility
of his insanity
although we?ve never asked for that legacy ?
Incriminated - no forgiveness
Incriminated - no forgiveness
Indescribeable, inhuman greed for power
supported by fanatics under his spell
Obsessed by his aim to wipe out non-arayans
he rushed millions of people into desaster
Why do we take the reponsibility
of his insanity
although we?ve never asked for that legacy ?
Incriminated - no forgiveness
Incriminated - no forgiveness
More than 40 years after his predestined fall 
we still got to take the responsibility
For those events we know from the history book
Why should we feel guilty for deeds
 done in the past ?
It began about half a century ago,
