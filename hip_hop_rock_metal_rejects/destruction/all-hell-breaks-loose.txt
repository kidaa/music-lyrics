The fire in our eyes still burns
Longer than this tasteless planet turns
We've been fightin' on the darker side
The keeper of darkness is our guide
The end is near no you can pray
Dead men tell no fuckin' tales
Death and destruction but we'll stay
The poor believing mankind fails
Our evil preed prepared their meal really well
The fast food society right now can't tell
The suicide solution to escape our might
Won't help your soul to get out of sight
The end is near so you can pray ....
All hell breaks loose
You've got no choice
Cause you're just Satan's toys
All hell breaks loose
You've got no choice
Cause you follow his voice
With open arms we wait for those,
Who didn't choose to pray and pose
The legions of black will scream out their hails
The principle of all religions fails
You've fallen in missgrace,
You've been praying since you've been told
The deal with god is to believe to get old
You've been kneeling, hoping and begging for relief
Now your life will steal away like a thief
But on your soul are black marks and it fakes,
We got you on our side, you made too many mistakes,
You've suffered all your life to be a good guy
A big fucking lie - burn in hell!
