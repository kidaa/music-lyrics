I'am dissenting
I'am looking differently
I do whatever I please
exactly what I want to be
I don't fit into the general rules
I ignore them all the time
breakin' the rules
gonna take my share
live my own life
I don't care
I don't fit into the general rules
I ignore them all the time
united we stand- eternal ban
together we are strong - eternal ban
long haired crowd 
is going their own way
they are invincible
if together they stand
I don't fit into the general rules
I ignore them all the time
united we stand- eternal ban
together we are strong - eternal ban
