Don't look around, I tell you what you will see
There's only dirt everywhere
Step with my feet in puddles of acid rain
I cannot bear
Running around in a polluted world - it's such a drag
Taking a breath of this toxic air - I'm frekin' out
Hiding behind these walls every day - upset my mind
Cannot believe, it's getting worse - no solution in sight
I'm so fuckin' bored, can't stand it
I can't think of things to do
Only I know it's no pleasure
Expectations won't come true
Sick of this, I don't wanna go out
Too many people, much too many around
Heat gets stronger - better leave a last sigh
Fear the future 'cause a nuclear plant won't last for long
Spit on those who tell me that it makes sense
and that I'm wrong
Running around in a polluted world it's such a drag
Taking a breath of this toxic air -
I'm frekin' out
I'm so fuckin' bored
This world os passing away
