I am caught in a dream
And I am trying to pass through
Something insane is one the prowl
Uncertainly is frighting me
It will get me , it will choke me
Screaming in my bed in agony
When I hear the clock
I have got to wake up
Cause falling back asleep
Means to get in his trap
Release from agony , release from agony
This nightmare surrounds me
I am prepared for the worst
Captured timeless in the darkness
One second seems like eternity
It will...
Getting in a state of panic
This can't be just imagination
I am praying to be awake
I don't want to face this vicious circle
I know this nightmare will reverd
It is drinking me to despair
My refuge will be reality
Release from aginy
