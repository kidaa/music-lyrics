I can feel compassion
I can feel you your pain
I can see you slippin' down the drain
It's so insane right before you crack
Such an evil curse infected head
And the voices say you'll end up dead
Like Nostradamus right before you crack

If you're going out
Next time around
You'll be six feet down if you're goin out
If you're goin out
Next time around
You'll be six feet down if you're going out

I can see your monster makes you shake and tweeze
Crawling on your back watch your sanity freeze
Right before you die, right before you crack
Keep this a secret don't tell a soul
Your losing grip of self control
Maybe pray to God right before you crack

If you're going out
Next time around
You'll be six feet down if you're going out
If you're going out
Next time around
You'll be six feet down if you're going out

I can see your monster
He can see you shake
I can see your monster
Wait for you to break
It's not a secret- words on the street
Pray for Mother Mary for my soul to keep
Pray to your God- pray to your demons
Have I not bowed?
Have I not bowed?
