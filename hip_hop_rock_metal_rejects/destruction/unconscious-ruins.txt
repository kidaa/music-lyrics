All the faces, all the voices
seem to fade in the crowd
Neurotic minds realize the danger
expect their destiny, fear the future
Past never changes
running into unconscious ruins
future can?t be hidden
starring at unconscious ruins
The mor they know, the less they talk
one day apprehensions will com true
Human beings blown out like candles
Mankind executed by itself
Past never changes
running into unconscious ruins
future can?t be hidden
starring at unconscious ruins
It?s not too late to realize 
why people fake ignorance
inside they are scared to death
but too weak to react.
Past never changes
running into unconscious ruins
future can?t be hidden
starring at unconscious ruins
Death is knocking at your backdoor
don?t turn your back
in this the fall of humanity
nuclear holocaust our imminent fate ?
Past never changes
running into unconscious ruins
future can?t be hidden
