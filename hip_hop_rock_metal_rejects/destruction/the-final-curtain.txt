Feel the hate that burns deep in your sick soul
Your psychotic mind is totally out of our logical control
How the fuck should I know that you did decide
That I'm your unsuspecting target to build up your pride
You did hurt my friends and you've destroyed my property
Fear speeds all around like cancer at the last stage
You're a dangerous criminal ruthless violent animal
Why did I trust in the power of the law?
I've paid my taxes all in time
I've been a faithful citizen
I was not prepared for this crime
Now I take justice in my hands
The final curtain falls
You will enter the twilight halls
The final curtain falls
The final curtain falls
Taste my deadly revenge, smell your upcoming pain
Eat the dust to which you will decay nothing will remain!
I've been fighting for my rights but the wheels of the law
Turned out to be a toothless shark
Don't turn your back - looser - it's over!
