Not really - concerned about your opinion,
Not really - taking care of your ass,
Maybe - tomorrow things are turning,
Maybe - soon you'll catch the fall!
Not really - interested in your future,
Not really - hopin' for a consequence,
Never ever - believe a word I say,
Never ever - trust in my own dreadful way!
Push, hurt and bite if you're ruthless enough -
Soon you'll have more might!
Insult, lie and steal - for a better cooperation
Hit, rape and kill!
Dirty hypocrisy
To be or fuckin' not to be
Inconsiderate success
My existence is a mess!
Kingdom of damnation
My might is damned to turn into deprecation
Kingdom of damnation might and lies made my derivation
Scream shout and spit - I'm just defending -
For a better understanding!
