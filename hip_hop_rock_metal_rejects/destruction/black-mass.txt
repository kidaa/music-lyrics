I kneel in front of the altar
It's covered with flowers
I pray to the Lord Jesus
And confess my sins
I hear a scornful laughing
Voices sound through the silence
The organ plays by oneself
Hell what's happen here?
I look around and scare
Skulls lie on the black altar
All crosses are turned
Green blood drops from the walls
Demoniac monsters grin at me
All over signs of the evil
A man with a black wat floats over me
Glowing eyes stare in the distance
Total calm the figure raise the voice
"Our master is angry
We must appease him
You're chosen be happy"
Panic takes me, I run to the gates it's open
Nobody stops my rout
"Don't be so stupid
