Don't try to reach light of day
Then you will never be in trouble
As soon as you're here they interfere
And start to fill your brain with crap
Die a day before you're born
Die a day before you're born
You'll be carried to church
They'll drown you in water
Just to give you a name you will hate
They make believe in lies and deceit
Make you a part of human greed
Enjoy the place where you are
So cozy and warm
Suspended in a big fat belly
Commit suicide before the real life begins
And cut your navel  string
Die - nine months are enough - a day before you're born
Die before the dreadful dawn
