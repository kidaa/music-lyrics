Witches been slaughtered at the stakes
They're been burned 'cause
They were in league with Satan
People delighted themselves
When this creatures burned painfully
Witches decided to take vengeance
Satan sent a legion of poisoned rats
The Warriors of death and most evil in human
The Sentence Of Death
Drives you to despair
God can't help ya
You sheveled your own grave!
Now the mortal is in bondage of Satan
Without mercy theu persecuted people
Got a place in Hell resrved for you!
