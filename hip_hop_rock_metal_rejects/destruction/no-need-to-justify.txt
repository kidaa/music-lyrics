Time to cast a magic spell
Keep our souls, prevent to sell
Fill the void inside our hearts
Try to wipe out deepest scars
Sue me for an easy lie
No one's ever seen me cry
You and me won't lose our pride
If we now refuse to hide
That's what we all begin to learn
Disrespect we don't deserve
In times like these we need to care
We've never ever really spoke
About the problems that provoked
A quiet destructive atmosphere
Going around round about
No one's to lead try to succeed
There's no need to justify
Intrigued ways to say goodbye
Side by side not upside down
Don't reject emotions now
Though I know your confused mind
Think it's willing to unwind
No one's to blame what happened there
At the abyss of deep despair
It's been a lack of sympathy
Some time has passed to get to know
Why everybody acted so
It's been a lack of sympathy
