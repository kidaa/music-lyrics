Eternal darkness a ripper approaches
He returns from his mission
He has onlyone target
Death and destruction
You never see him
You never hear him
You don't know his name
You don't know where he comes from
If you encount him, run for your life
Death line his way
Sword and axe are his weapons
his fame hurries on ahead
he leaves anxiety and terror
His master expects him
he doesn't tolerate failures
his power is vast
he's a lot of names
call him reverential
the evil one
