Nothing to say, to be honest
Got no idea what to talk about now
Speaking my mind is so useless
Can't think of words that suit the stale I'm in
Don't know at all what it's all about
All day long I'm smoking
Always a thrill butI'm not getting high
I'm not excited
I don't feel like it
Deterioration
I've got a cracked brain, cracked brain
Feel too lazy to get up
Just stay in bed and rest my mind
Nowhere to go - no one's waiting
All I want is to get passed this day
Stare at a box with moving pictures
Lie on a rug and let the time pass by
Clouds of smoke inside my bedroom
Floating away and leave reality behind
