Sliding into deep depression
Leaving such a magic time
Away from all the world's intrusion
To find liberation in mind
You're just a fool and it's true
Don't know what's going on around you
Destroy your hope and your dreams
Insatiablity speaks
Support the cultural decay
Sell and buy and betray
Destroy your hope and your dreams
Insatiablity speaks
The good vibes don't last
Intoxication has past
Next time I want more
Give me some more than before
So far away from beyond and before
In a new kind of world where it's all unsure
Step back again and remember the time
When your mind was free
Weak, can feel your body suffer
I know what makes you insecure now
The ease of going on and abuse
Commit a serious crime
To make the stuff all mine
I will get me everything
Then I will live like a king
You're just a fool and it's true
Don't know what's going on around you
Insatiablity speaks
Too far away from beyond and before
In a new kind of world where it's all unsure
Step back again and remember the time
