I am an invincible force of evil
My eternal hatred is destructive
There's no chance to survive
I incarnate the end of mankind
I'm in cverst of human flesh
And you agonize in a pod of blood
Don't try to escape or to resist
Cause Christ won't help you tonight
Invincible force , invincible force
You break down in the morass
Turn and see them blood stained daws
Now I fear the shreds out of your face
Now you will curse your day of birth
You agonize in a pod of blood
You scream out and begg of mercy
Don't try...
