Early morning the mankind sleeps
There's a roaring in the air
Impenetrable fog
Thunder rolls and lightning strikes
Hell storms , rush over the earth , but there is no rain
Hell storms , rush over the earth , bestial invasion
Fog cleared up people scream
They won't believe that the evil takes control
Hell storms...
Your time is out obsession spreads
Death rules Satan's law is in command
Jesus Christ exists no longer , you better pray to the new lord
Cause he's almighty obey him
Hell storms...
