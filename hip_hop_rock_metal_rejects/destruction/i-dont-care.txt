Well you're all spaced out like a UFO
You're a semi hemi baby but your motor's blown

Strung out electric sippin' antiseptic
Drop you like a hand grenade
Murder city devil never on the level
Kill you with my serenade

I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too
I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too

Kickin out the jams like the "MC5"
You're a nuclear bomb in a cold nosedive

Strung out electric sippin' antiseptic
Drop you like a hand grenade
Murder city devil never on the level
Kill you with my serenade

I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too
I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too

I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too
I don't care what I gotta do to love you
I don't need, need you to love me too
