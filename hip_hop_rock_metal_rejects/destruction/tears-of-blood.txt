A stream of blood is runnin', runnin' down the east,
In the slaughterhouse of salvia they're celebrating a big feast
Collecting dead bodies became their only sick challenge
The borders of atrocity are running out of balance
The dreadful beast did proudly sharpen his knifes
Thousands of husbands are losing their wives
Proudly they present their dead trophies on TV
You've to pay with your life if you wanna be free!
Tears of blood
Running down a cold check,
Eyes have seen so much
Sorrow committed by a freak!
Tears of blood,
Will leave their deep traces
To remember all the deadly screaming faces!
Now everything is over we're starting to forget,
For a fowl nation it's time now to regret
But hatred will dig the scares deep in their hearts,
So the pain will end we're it starts!
