Allah , Buddah , Jesus Christ
Whatever your god may be forget those idols let me told you
They're tales of morbid brains
Everybody thinks has right
That these gods are the only truth
Fanatic faith , fanatic deeds
Join my religion or die , Jews killed Jesus Christ slaughtered
jews
Millions die for their faith
Each religion prays that killing is a sin
How stupid logic can be
Curse the gods too many people have died
Curse the gods that fools have died for a lie
Beware of those fools that Icep of talking you
God loves you , for you his son died
Fuck them , believe in yourself
Gods reality is just a lie
Curse...
