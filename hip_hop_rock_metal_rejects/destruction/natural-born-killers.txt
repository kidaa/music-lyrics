There you are, the superstar
Caged and bound - don't they look smashing
With all your camera punk ass flashing
There you are it's so bizarre
Broken down the captains shattered
Sunken ship but it don't matter
I've packed the bags under my eyes and now
I'm fine

Let me be your one and only cockstar
357 with my goddamn on star
Natural Born Killer
Livin like a jack with my one eye open
Lost generation and were anti posing
Natural Born Killer

So there it is - it's who we are
Black and blue prints for disaster
Guaranteed to kill you faster
Emperors it's time for war
Lost angels of your de-construction
Bone out cause the cocks in motion
I got strychnine on my tongue and
I'm feeling F. I .N. E. Fine

Let me be your one and only cockstar
357 with my goddamn on star
Natural Born Killer

Livin like a jack with my one eye open
Lost generation and were anti posing
Natural Born Killer

Natural Born Killer natural Born Killer
Natural Born Killer
I'll prey on you when you're weak
Natural Born Killer
