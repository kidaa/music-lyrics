I was born in a dark winter night
Thunder and lightning greeted me
Now it's time to begin to fight
Kingdom of heaven; I can't see!
My home is the bloody hell
The place where Satan rules
The world is now like a big shell
The fire of hell will destruct you fools
I can never trust the virgin preacher
I don't believe in Jesus Christ
It's all right cuz' Satan is my teacher
Hidden 'them' when we arise
I command and you get down on your knees
We sacrifice infancy on Satan's order
Come taste blood, our living grease
Headless bodies found, one is your daughter
I can never trust the virgin preacher .....
I was born in a dark winter night
Thunder and lightning greeted me
Now it's time to begin to fight
Kingdom of heaven; I can't see!
I can never trust the virgin preacher .....
