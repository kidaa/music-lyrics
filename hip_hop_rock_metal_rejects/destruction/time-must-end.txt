There's no more to be felt
No need to gasp for air
Floor of the bathroom has stopped to be
So cold and hard - so cold and hard
There's no more sound to be heard
The roome became gloomy
But I was still conscious in spite of
The silence and void - silence and void
Have no perception of shapes or forms
No concrete memory ... no here and there
Only a knowledge of my being's all I have
There ain't nothing, no one, nowhere
Alone ... alone
Time must end - nothing to help me
Endless pain and tormenting want
It started to dawn on me then
Initially too weak to notice
And too far away to get fully aware
Of light shining there
Struck by sudden hope
Light became brighter and brighter
And started to brust - started to brust
Frightened of thoughts
That will eat me up from inside
There's no escape, no way to erase
Nothingness, crushed from outside
Feel like dust that's lost in nowhere
Ashamed ... ashamed
Time must end - nothing to help me
