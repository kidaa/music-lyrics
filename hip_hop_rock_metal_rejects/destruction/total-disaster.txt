I was born in a dark winter night
Thunder and lightning greeted me
Now it's the time to begin to flight
Kingdom of heaven, I can't see
My home is the bloody Hell
At the place where Satan rules
The world is now like a big shell
The fire of Hell will destroy the fools
I can never trust the virgin preacher
I can never believe in Jesus Christ
It's all right 'cause Satan in my teacher
People hidden then when we arised
I command and you get down on your knees
We sacrifice infants on Satan's order
Come taste blood, our living grease
Headless bodies found, one is your daughter
