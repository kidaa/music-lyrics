Curse the day ten painful years ago,
Since our legacy suffered in death row!
But the eternal ban and the spirit survived,
Over the years like a thorn in the flesh!
The importance of our new mission now is clear
We will break banging necks all over we appear.
Infernal overkill to all the envied souls,
Death to all religions and their sick goals!
The butcher strikes back
Devastating thrash attack
An invincible force - released from agony
Hail to those who obey
And believe in DESTRUCTION
During our absence we have realized,
We've convinced that all you all out there kept us alive
Thanks to those who are not just a face in crowd
It makes us in our black hearts really proud!
Thanks to those who obey and believe
Thanks to those who obey and believe
In DESTRUCTION - strikes back
Devastating thrash attack
Hail to those who obey and believe
Hail to those who obey and believe in
DESTRUCTION ...
