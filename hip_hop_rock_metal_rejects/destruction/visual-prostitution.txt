I can't look at the goddamned screen,
Too many losers show no self-esteem
Do me a favor don't abuse my eyes,
You're telling lies - you're low!
Tell them things they don't need to know
A star for one day forgotten tomorrow
Trying to get more self convidence
Denude your soul - your low!
Down - down - down
Down with your pants
Down - down - down
Embarrassing self-defense
What a fuckin' evolution
- visual prostitution
Shame on our constitution
- visual prostitution
Stupid people telling lies - visual prostitution
Ugly faces - thousand cries - visual prostitution
Stories we don't need to hear - visual prostitution
Stuck this shit right up your rear - visual ...
I can't stand your stupid ugly face,
I hate the sound of your weak voice,
Do use a favor cause you've got no pride
Down with your pants - you're low!
