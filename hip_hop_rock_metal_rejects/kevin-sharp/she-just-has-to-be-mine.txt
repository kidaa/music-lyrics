I wrote it down when I was only
A young boy of seventeen, a long list of what true love means
Now I'm here on the wrong side of lonely
'Cause I never really knew what really matters to me
She don't have to be rich
She don't have to be wild
She don't have to be seen in the latest style
I don't care if she's tough, of just a little bit shy
Either one will be fine
She just has to be mine
How could I been so foolish?
Right there in black and white, my future Mrs. Right
Hey, I barely scratched the surface
But that's not what I'm looking for anymore
She don't have to be rich
She don't have to be wild
She don't have to be seen in the latest style
I don't care if she's tough, of just a little bit shy
Either one will be fine
She just has to be mine
It took a while to see
All that she has to be
Someone who faithfully
Just stays in love with me
She don't have to be rich
She don't have to be wild
She don't have to be seen in the latest style
I don't care if she's tough, of just a little bit shy
Either one will be fine
She just has to be mine
She don't have to be rich
She don't have to be wild
She don't have to be strong, she just has to be mine
She don't have to be hip, or drink the finest wine
She don't have to be tough, she just has to be mine
