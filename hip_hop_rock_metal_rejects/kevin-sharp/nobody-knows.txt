Joesph Richards/Don DuBose
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it 
But me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it
But me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jugsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
Nobody knows it but me
