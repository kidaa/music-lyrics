Bob Regan/George Teren
Throw away the book, forget about the rules, set aside your doubts
They don't apply now
Everything you know, all that's gone before
Ain't what we're about, it's here and right now
Compared to any other love, baby this is way more
Beyond the physical
This ain't your typical
Predictable
Here today and gone tomorrow fling
It's more of a magical
Mystical
Once in every lifetime thing
It may sound improbable
It ain't logical
But when love is this undeniable
It's everything and it's anything
But typical
Jealousy and pride, all that petty stuff, trips the others up
With us there's no way
We can rise above, go against the gray
We'll be strong enough to make our own way
The future that I'm seeing ain't a paint by numbers picture
It's an original
This ain't your typical
Predictable
Here today and gone tomorrow fling
It's more of a magical
Mystical
Once in every lifetime thing
It may sound improbable
It ain't logical
But when love is this undeniable
It's everything and it's anything
But typical
It's everything and it's anything
But typical
Predictable
It ain't typical
It ain't typical
