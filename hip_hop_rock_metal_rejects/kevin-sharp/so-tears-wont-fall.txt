Bruce Roberts/Gary Burr
One good bye
And the world that I knew
Just slips away
And dares me to forget it
I know my heart
Will heal one day
If memories will let it
It hurts when everything reminds me of you
So to protect myself, what else can I do?
I think of the sun
I think of the rain
I'll count the shadows on the wall, so I won't feel the pain
'Cause if I think of you
My strength will be gone
So I'll do anything at all
So tears won't fall
How I try
Never to slip
And speak your name
It would come so easy
That would just stir the fire again
That I swore was cold inside me
I almost loved you, but I stopped just in time
If I'm to save myself, you can't cross my mind
I think of the sun
I think of the rain
I'll count the shadows on the wall, so I won't feel the pain
'Cause if I think of you
My strength will be gone
So I'll do anything at all
So tears won't fall
If my thoughts would let you through
You'd find your way back somehow
That's not what I need right now
So to protect myself
I think of the sun
I think of the rain
I'll count the shadows on the wall, so I won't feel the pain
'Cause if I think of you
My strength will be gone
So I'll do anything at all
Yes I'll do anything at all
So tears won't fall
