Larry Boone/Rick Bowles
I may never buy me a big house
A Cadillac, cruising with the top down
That aint the way I am
I judge a man by the gold on the inside
Im not fooled by the glitter on the outside
That aint the measure of a man
It aint how far you go
It aint how much you make
Son, its what you give
Not what you take
Its being strong and true
To those counting on you
Its lendin a hand, makin a stand
Thats the measure of a man
I give an honest days work for an honest days pay
Ill stand behind every word I say
Ill seal a deal with a shake of a hand
If Im a few rungs short of the top of the ladder
When I meet my maker what will it matter
That aint the measure of a man
It aint how far you go
It aint how much you make
Son, its what you give
Not what you take
Its being strong and true
To those counting on you
Its lendin a hand, makin a stand
Thats the measure of a man
Its lendin a hand, makin a stand
Thats the measure of a man
Thats the measure of a man
