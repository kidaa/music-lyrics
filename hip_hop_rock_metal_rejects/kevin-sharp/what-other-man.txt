with Neal McCoy
Linda Thompson/Reed Vertelney
I sometimes feel you drift away
And I wonder if you'll always stay
I hold you close, to feel your heart
Yes, then I know, we'll never part
'Cause I can give you everything
My love will never leave your side
I'll be there in your darkest night
Be your strength when you want to hide
And what other man
Would give every thought he has
Speak with love in all that he says
Give all he is and hopes to be
And what other man could love you like me?
No other love for me will do
I've known the thrill of loving you
All of my dreams sleep in your eyes
I give them to you to realize
'Cause I can give you everything
My love will never leave your side
I'll be there in your darkest night
Be your strength when you want to hide
And what other man
Would give every thought he has
Speak with love in all that he says
Give all he is and hopes to be
And what other man could love you like me?
I'll build you a wall
Keep you from harm
When life is cold
I'll keep you warm
And what other man
Would give every thought he has
Speak with love in all that he says
Give all he is and hopes to be
And what other man
Oh, And what other man
Would give every thought he has
Speak with love in all that he says
Give all he is and hopes to be
And what other man could love you like me?
