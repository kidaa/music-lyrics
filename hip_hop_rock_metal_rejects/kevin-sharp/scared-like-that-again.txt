At the Praire View Motel
They've got a swimming pool shaped like the state of Texas
And a room with a view, on our honeymoon
We were learning new dances
I remember my hands were shaking
I didn't know what to do
You had to show me
And the world just seemed to stand still
In that road-side adobe
Two hearts, beating as one
Lost in the moon, found by the sun
Too soon to know for sure, but too late to run
I wanna be scared like that again
Feel the wave of emotion come rushing in
My trembling lips, the taste of your kiss
The touch of our skin
I wanna be loved like that all night
I wanna be shocked by the morning light
Let love take us back, I wanna be scared like that again
Lately we've been coasting
Living day after day
Safe and familiar
But hidden somewhere
Is that feeling we shared
When love was an adventure
So tonight let's walk to the edge
Where love is so deep it scares us to death
You catch me when I fall, and I'll catch my breath
I wanna be scared like that again
Feel the wave of emotion come rushing in
My trembling lips, the taste of your kiss
The touch of our skin
I wanna be loved like that all night
I wanna be shocked by the morning light
Let love take us back, I wanna be scared like that again
I wanna be scared like that again
Feel the wave of emotion come rushing in
My trembling lips, the taste of your kiss
The touch of our skin
I wanna be loved like that all night
I wanna be shocked by the morning light
Let love take us back, I wanna be scared like that again
I wanna be scared
Let love take us back
