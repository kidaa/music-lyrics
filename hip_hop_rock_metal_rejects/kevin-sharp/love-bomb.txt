Robert Ellis Orrall/Angelo
Met her on Monday down at the Blue Star
Where we all hang out
I picked her up at work Tuesday afternoon
That night we were rocking the town
Wednesday, Thursday, Time sure flies 
When youre having a ball
A perfect match, no strings attached
By Friday wed done it all
Saturday night under the stars
Huggin and a-kissin in the back of her car
I said, ";Aint this the life, what could go wrong?";
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
Those three little words 
Set off a chain reaction like Id never seen
I was shakin in my boots
When she lit the fuse I was blown to smithereens
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, It hit me like a ton of bricks
Shed got a mind to cross that line
I shoulda known it would come to this
Saturday night under the stars
Huggin and a-kissin in the back of her car
I said, ";Aint this the life, what could go wrong?";
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
I was keeping it loose, taking it  slow
Playing it cool, but wouldnt you know
Saturday night under the stars
Huggin and a-kissin in the back of her car
I said, ";Aint this the life, what could go wrong?";
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb
