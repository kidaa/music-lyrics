Zack Turner/Lonnie Wilson
Its five oclock
At the Sad Cafe
Dinner for one, a table for two
Another lonely day
She tries to hide the pain
But her strong will is just a weak disguise
Its there in her eyes
She wants to be somebodys baby
She wants to be somebodys friend
She just needs a choulder to lean on now and then
Shes no stranger to danger
Shes had her heart broke a time or two
She wants to be somebodys baby
But shes nobodys fool
Someone long ago
Promised her the moon
But the fairy tale didnt go so well
It ended way too soon
And the scars of love
Have been known to take some time to heal
Cant you see how she feels
She wants to be somebodys baby
She wants to be somebodys friend
She just needs a choulder to lean on now and then
Shes no stranger to danger
Shes had her heart broke a time or two
She wants to be somebodys baby
But shes nobodys fool
Shes no stranger to danger
Shes had her heart broke a time or two
She wants to be somebodys baby
But shes nobodys fool
