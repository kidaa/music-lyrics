We decided to try
Going our own ways for while
And give each other some space
But I never dreamed it would be miles
I thought she would cry
While she was packing up 
I guess something isn't wrong enough
She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here 
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me
You couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and
She's sure taking it well
There go all of my dreams
Melting like sugar in the rain
I would love to believe
She's only smiling through the pain
All the tears are mine
Shouldn't she be sad
After losing everything we had
She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here 
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me
You couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and
She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well
