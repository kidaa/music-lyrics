Skip Ewing/Donny Kees
In every life they say
One perfect love comes your way
I know for my heart that's true
There's only you
When sorrow brings me pain
If teardrops fall like rain
Who else can I turn to
There's only you
Every night I thank the Lord above
For giving you to me
All my life I'll give you all my love
True and faithfully
So darlin' say youll stay
Dont take your love away
Ill never find someone new
There's only you
