When it comes to love Ive had my doubts
But when you walked in my heart checked out
And like a schoolboy crush
I knew it when we touched
Im already loving you too much
Mind and body, heart and soul
You came in and took control
And, oh what a rush
This is powerfull stuff
Im already loving you too much
Too much, Im already falling too fast
Too much, Its too late for me to turn back
I cant stop this love that weve started
Too much, Im already falling too fast
Too much, Its too late for me to turn back
I cant stop this love that weve started
Who knows where Ill go from here
Im too far gone to see it clear
So my heart Ill have to trust
And hope that its enough
'Cause Im already loving you 
Theres nothing left for me to do
Im already loving you too much
Already loving you too much
