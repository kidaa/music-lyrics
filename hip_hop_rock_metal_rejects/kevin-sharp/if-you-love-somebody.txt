Mount Everest, I'll climb it
No problem, just say when
Mississippi, I'll swim it
Down to the delta and back again
If you love somebody
It ain't that hard
If you love somebody
To go that far
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you do
If you love somebody
The way that I do you
Get a ladder, a cheap guitar
And serenade you under the stars
Scream and shout, make a scene
Tell the world that your the girl of my dreams
If you love somebody
That's what you do
If you love somebody
And your love is true
You don't think twice about being a fool
If you love somebody
The way that I do you
Send me down the river with my soul on fire
The thought of you makes the weight of this
World seem a little bit lighter
If you love somebody, if you love somebody
Ooh, send me down the river with my soul on fire
The thought of you makes the weight of this
World seem a little bit lighter
Taking me higher, higher
If you love somebody
You do anything
If you love somebody
You jump up and sing
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you do
If you love somebody
The way that I do you
If you love somebody
That's what you do
If you love somebody
And your love is true
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you do
If you love somebody
The way that I do you
The way that I do you, girl
