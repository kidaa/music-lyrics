She's one in a million, I've heard that a million times
The odds were less that even she'd be mine
How many times does a dream come true, come into your life?
I can't believe the way she makes me feel
I have to pinch myself to know it's real
A touch so soft
A smile so sweet
She's so much like an angel, she's heavenly
She's as perfect, as anyone can be
But her heart is only human
Guess that's why she's loving me
She could have had anyone she wanted, but still she wanted me
I do my best to give her what she needs
I thank my lucky stars above that I'm the one she loves
So many men will never find their way
To what I wake up looking forward to each day
A touch so soft
A smile so sweet
She's so much like an angel, she's heavenly
She's as perfect, as anyone can be
But her heart is only human
Guess that's why she's loving me
God never made a more down to earth girl
But the love she gives me takes me right out of this world
Oh she's as perfect, as anyone can be
But her heart is only human
Guess that's why she's loving me
But her heart is only human
I guess that's why she's loving me
