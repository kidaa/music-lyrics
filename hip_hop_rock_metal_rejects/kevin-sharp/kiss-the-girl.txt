Bob Regan/George Teren
There's a little voice inside your head
That's getting hard to ignore
Your pulse is racing and your heart is set
What are you waiting for?
How many moments like this come along?
The kind that change your whole world?
If you just stand there, it could be gone
Kiss the girl, take a chance
Let her know where you stand
Hold her close, make it real
If it's love that you feel
Kiss the girl
Don't you see the way she looks at you?
Can there be any doubt?
Everything you feel, she's feeling too
Your chance is here and now
All this emotion you've been holding inside
Can't be put into words
Best way to show her is to just close eyes and
Kiss the girl, take a chance
Let her know where you stand
Hold her close, make it real
If it's love that you feel
Kiss the girl
Kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
Kiss the girl
