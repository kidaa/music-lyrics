Chris Farren/Kevin Sharp
Im proud of my history, proud of my home
But there comes a time in a young boys life
When he feels hes got to roam
Daddy says Im crazy, Mama thinks Im naive
But if I dont do it now then Ill never leave
Cause Ive driven every back road in this part of the state
Aint a girl in my graduation class that I didnt date
Tried everything on the menu down at Fiddlers Bar & Grill
I got a taste for something this town will never fill
Theres a great big world out there for me to see
I might sail a boat to China, chase dreams in Tennessee
Right now the motors running, just a few things I gotta do
Tell my friends goodbye
Drive these streets for one last time 
Change that city limit sign 
To ";Population 4000 Minus 1";
Gonna see the bright lights, gonna make my mark
So many things Ive got to do I dont know where to starts
Play cards in Vegas, walk the beach at Malibu
Learn a few things that I never knew
Theres a great big world out there for me to see
Might play for the 49ers, Mardi Gras in New Orleans
Right now the motors running, just a few things I gotta do
Tell my friends goodbye
Drive these streets for one last time 
Change that city limit sign 
To ";Population 4000 Minus 1";
Now Im stuck in New York City, staring at these walls
Thinking how the grass out here aint that green at all
Aint that green at all
Theres a great big world out there for me to see
I might wed a farmers daughter and raise a family
Right now the clock is ticking, just a few things I gotta do
Tell my friends goodbye
Ride that subway one last time 
Change that city limit sign 
To ";Population 12 Million Minus 1";
To ";Population 12 Million Minus 1";
Coming home, coming home
