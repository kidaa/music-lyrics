We don't talk much, anymore
Though I'm dying to call
You say it's over, now for sure
But for me it isn't over at all
I lie awake and struggle every night
Though it's less than what it was
It's more than I can fight
It's still love and it still has awesome power inside and over me
Look inside my heart, it's still love
Even though we're not together there's a part of me
That's never gonna change, that's still burning with the flame
Even though it's not the same as it was
It's still love, to me
Still love
I don't know quite who's to blame
Truth is I don't really care
'Cause either way the story's just the same
I reach out for you but you're never there
I'd like to hate you but I know that I can't
I'm angry and I'm hurt but on the other hand
It's still love and it still has awesome power inside and over me
Deep inside my heart, it's still love
Even though we're not together there's a part of me
That's never gonna change, that's still burning with the flame
Even though it's not the same as it was
It's still love, to me
It's still love
It's still love and it still has awesome power inside and over me
Deep inside my heart, it's still love
Even though we're not together there's a part of me
That's never gonna change, that's still buring with the flame
Even though it's not the same as it was
It's still love, to me
It's still love
It's still love
In these arms, in this heart, in these eyes
It's still love
In this room, in the dark, every night
It's still love
In this town, in this world, in my life
It's still love
It's still love
