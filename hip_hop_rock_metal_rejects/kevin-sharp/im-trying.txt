Darrell Scott/Tia Sillers
She said I'm not pointing fingers
And he said yes you are
'Cause you wouldn't bring it up if you weren't
If I told you I'd been walking
Out in the dark night thinking
Would you take as truth this alcholoics word?
I can't change what's done is done
But I can tell you this
Not a day goes by that I don't curse myself and all my sins
And I need you to hold on to while this part of me is dying
Though I haven't kicked the demons that haunt me
I'm trying
I'm trying
She sat down on the floor
And said I wish I was stronger
Right now I feel fragile as glass
I want to believe you
Believe what's held you has freed you
And I hate these doubts that keep on coming back
My parents think I'm crazy for staying here this long
But there's nothing more I want for us than to prove to them they're wrong
I don't want to be afraid, I don't want to think you're lying
And though I haven't found the faith yet, that I need
I'm trying
Oh, I'm trying
He asked, do you want me to leave?
'Cause if you do, you know I will
But she said, much to his disbelief
No, I love you still
He said I don't know why I've been the fool
But I can tell you this
Not a day goes by that I don't curse myself and all my sins
Then he dropped down to his knees, by now they both were crying
Said, I haven't been the man I want to be
But, I'm trying
Oh,I'm trying
I'm trying
Oh Lord, I'm trying
