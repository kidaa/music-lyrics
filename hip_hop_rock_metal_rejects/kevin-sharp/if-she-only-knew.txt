If she only knew, what I knew but could not say
If she could just see that part of me I hid away
If I could just hold her in my arms again
And just say 'I love you'
What can I say, maybe she'd stay, if she only knew
If she could just feel, what I feel here in my heart
She'd know it was real, going true right from the start
But I'm just a man who didn't understand
What she was going through
She's gone away, maybe she'd stay, if she only knew
How?  How did I let her get away?
Love, love is so easy to feel, but the hardest word to say
If she could just see, what I see when I close my eyes
She's all that I dream, surely she would realize
But like a fool I waited much too long
To let her know the truth
She's gone away. maybe she'd stay, if she only knew
How?  How did I let her get away?
Love, love is so easy to feel, but the hardest word to say
If she only knew, what I knew but could not say
If she could just see that part of me that I hid away
If I could just hold her in my arms again
And just say 'I love you'
She's gone away, maybe she'd stay, if she only knew
Only knew
My world is gray, each night I pray, she only knew
That she only knew
The price that I'll pay, what can I say?
If she only knew
If she only knew
If she only knew
Oh...yeah
