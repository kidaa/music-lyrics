I'm all right, I'm okay
And I'll live to fight for another day
'Cause I've got hope and that's enough
Until I find the strength to love
Like a weary fighter knocked off his feet
I couldn't even feel my own heart beat
But I've got faith to lift me up
Until I find the strength to love
I know down deep there's a spark
Inside this broken heart of mine
I'll be as strong as before
It's just a matter of time
What's done is done
And I'll rise above
And I will find
The strength to love
I know down deep there's a spark
Inside this broken heart of mine
I'll be as strong as before
It's just a matter of time
I'm all right, I'm okay
And I'll live to fight for another day
'Cause I've got hope and thats enough
Until I find the strength to love
Until I find the strength to love
