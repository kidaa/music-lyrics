Jeffrey Steele/Kim Carnes
A simple disagreement
Over something so small
That's how it always starts
It ain't no one's fault
We both had to be right
That's when it all went wrong
Making something out of nothing when we should have been holding on
We can get through this
We can ride it out
Love's what we're about
We've been deeper down
This is shallow water baby
We've been up that hill
It ain't no big deal
Ain't no easy fix
But we can get through this
Get out of that rain
Baby come inside
We're gonna kiss and make up
If it takes all night
Let a little misunderstanding
Turn into a great big war
Talk about quitting, we're forgetting what it really is that we're fighting for
We can get through this
We can ride it out
Love's what we're about
We've been deeper down
This is shallow water baby
We've been up that hill
It ain't no big deal
Ain't no easy fix
But we can get through this
A little more forgiveness
Tenderness
We can get through this
This is shallow water baby
We've been up that hill
It ain't no big deal
Ain't no easy fix
But we can get through this
We can ride it out
Love's what we're about
We've been deeper down
This is shallow water baby
We've been up that hill
It ain't no big deal
Ain't no easy fix
But we can get through this
We can ride it out
Love's what we're about
We've been deeper down
We can get through this
We've been up that hill
It ain't no big deal
Ain't no easy fix
But we can get through this
