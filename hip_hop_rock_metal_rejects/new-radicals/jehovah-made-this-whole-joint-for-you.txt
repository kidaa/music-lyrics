Meet a girl I met Carolina 
her parents jumped off Niagara Falls 
she broke her hips when she was a baby 
trying to hop the Berlin wall 
it's not that she's anti-American 
Although she shot a mayor at nine 
he looked just like the prez on T.V 
she didn't know in '63 he had died 
Does she think this world is all wrong 
Does she think I'll rob her and run 
When I ask where she gets her gun 
And simply says scat boy scat scat 
But isn't it a wonderful world Carolina 
Look at the birds in the sky 
Jehovah made this whole joint for you Carolina 
And isn't it so wonderful to be alive 
So original in her black lipstick 
Listening to some obscure band 
But isn't she pissed at all the other non-conformists 
who listen to that same obscure band 
But that's OK she's helping the environment
By sipping on pure water and such 
Then screams we better start thinking about the Ozone
layer, While tossing out a Styrofoam cup 
Does she think this world is all wrong 
Does she think I'll rob her and run 
When I ask her where she gets her gun 
She simply says scat boy scat scat 
But isn't it a wonderful world Carolina 
Look at the birds in the sky 
Jehovah made this whole joint for you Carolina 
So isn't it so wonderful to be alive 
Real deep s*** on her mind 
"Let's kill the world, take over everything" 
She says "We don't need politicians, they breed mistrust, 
And as a matter of fact did you steal my purse?" 
Yeah, but isn't it a wonderful world Carolina 
look at the birds in the sky 
Jehovah made this whole joint for you Carolina 
So isn't it wonderful to be alive 
Huh isn't beautiful to be a... 
Isn't it wonderful to be alive... 
F*** yeah, it's so wonderful I feel like.. 
dying,
Smiling...
