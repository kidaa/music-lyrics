Two months of fun 
Two years of pain 
Add it up 
And get a life of rain 
need to scream 
But too ashamed 
it's gonna rain it's gonna rain 
You wanna go you wanna stay you wanna 
you really blew my world 
I wanna live and there's only one way 
I don't wanna die anymore 
I want to live it up 
I don't want this high anymore 
But I can't give it up 
I won't live a lie anymore 
I need to give you up 
Won't you save me 
Two Months of sun 
A life of rain 
Add it up 
I'm on my own aain 
Need to scream 
I'm so filled with rage 
It's gonna rain it's gonna rain 
You wanna go you wanna stay you wanna 
You really screwed my world 
I gotta live but you stand in the way 
I'm pullin out now "UHH" 
I don't wanna die anymore 
I want to live it up 
I don't want this high anymore 
But I can't give it up 
I won't live a lie anymore 
I need to give you up 
And "OH OH BABY" did you think that I was strong? 
Well "OH OH HONEY" can't ya see that you were wrong? 
"OH OH BABY" did you think that I was strong?
