Our lives? 
They're nine to seven 
Why aren't things wild? 
You said you was a flower child 
I can respect your soul searching 
But now's no time for questioning 
I'm sure you've been misled before 
And once you'd trust they'd slam the door 
But I'm everything I claim to be 
You just need vodka and honesty? 
Do you know who I am? 
Do you know who I am? 
My love is real 
As real as the flowers you smoke to get high 
My love is real 
As real as our god who has spoken on how we can fly 
My love is real 
As real as the flowers 
You're 22 why aren't you free? 
you're mom and daddy's victory 
a soul that's lived a thousand lives 
Don't hide behind a child's eyes 
I'm sure you've been misled before 
And once you'd trust they'd slam the door 
But I'm everything I claimed to be 
You just need vodka and LSD? 
Do you know who I am? 
Do you know who I am? 
My love is real, 
As real as the flowers you smoke to get high 
My love is real 
as real as our god who has spoken on how we can fly 
My love is real 
as real as the flowers 
I love you hate me 
I took math class that ain't a fair exchange 
I call you, you hang up 
Don't have to be a bitch and get your number changed! 
I'm sorry, forgive me 
I never meant to call you those names 
But I'm lonely, so lonely please
