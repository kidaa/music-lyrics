I was dancing 
With your shadow 
Slow down memories hall 
I said 'wait have I been seduced and forgotten' 
You said 'Baby haven't we all' 
Now I don't like crying 
Because it only gets me wet 
But I can't help failing 
To remember to forget you 
And I know it's going to be a long time 
And I'm crying like a church on Monday 
Praying for these feelings to go away 
So do me a favor baby 
Put down your new god 
And love me like Sunday again 
I was hiding in your bedroom 
When I saw him come inside 
I can't live in his shadow 
Is that where I'm dancing until I die 
No I don't light candles 
Because they make me see the light 
That I can't help failing 
To remember to forget you 
And I know it's gonna be a long time 
And I'm crying like a church on Monday 
praying for these feelings to go away 
So do me a favor baby 
Put down your new god 
And love me like Sunday again 
There ain't no use trying to stop me
