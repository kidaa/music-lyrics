She came from a world that is so far out 
Roller skating into my life I never had no doubt 
She asked where to get that velvet colored hair 
I said I got lot's more somewhere 
If you touch my big 
And she said I come from a world that is so far out 
And I said so do I 
And she may not be the worlds solution 
But she's a world class revolution 

Technicolor lover 
Rate my heart 
Technicolor lover 
Sate my heart 
Technicolor lover 
Take my heart...now 

lather, rinse, [repeat]
