There's something about you, 
tears me inside out whenever you're around 
There's something about you 
Speeding thru my veins until we hit the ground 
And there's something about this rush 
Take it away 
It made me feel so good 
I get a feeling, you get a feeling, we got a feeling 
like we could die 
And guess what mother 
we just cant get enough 
we just cant get enough 
Lover
we just gotta get it up 
we just gotta get it up 
There's something about you 
That tears me inside out whenever you're around 
And there's something about you 
That makes me fly 
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like 
and there's something about your kiss 
haunting and strange 
That makes me feel so good 
I get a feeling, you get a feeling we got a feeling 
Like we're alive 

[chorus]
This world may not have too much time 
But baby I'm fine because maybe you're mine 
We just can't get enough 
You better give up, come on and give up 
give up your life 
it's you for me, and me for you 
You make my dreams come true 
Off the wall coming from me 
But I wanna see this through, my baby 
You're on my mind all the time 
I found a million dimes 
You rolled the dice, and lost them all 
And baby I just don't mind 
And incidentally mother 

[chorus]

And I don't want no one if I cant have you 
a world of illusion 
But baby you're true 
I know I deceived you I once told you lies 
If you don't believe me 
Just look in my eyes
