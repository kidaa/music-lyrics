I saw your eyes 
I had to run away 
I fell to deep in love 
There were no words to say 
I just had to get high 
One look inside 
And I knew right away 
I felt too much 
I did not have the strength 
I just ran to get high 
But lover there's something about you pushing me 
Pulling me I saw your eyes 
Fell into yesterday 
An only child 
Until you let me stay 
I ha no one on my side 
Too weak to stand 
Too scared to love again 
The damn has broke 
My soul is spilling all over your hands 
Take a look in my eyes 
Lover
There's something about your pushing me 
Pulling me 
That's saying don't go away 
Ain't never gonna be another 
I see your eyes 
I'll never run away 
I fell too deep in love 
Only five words to say
