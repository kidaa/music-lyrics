I looked for love in Memphis 
I looked for love in Rome
Now that I finally got you 
I just wanna take you home 
I'm trying my best not to rush 
Because rushing ain't no fun 
But are you breaking the law 
Or looking out for miracles 
I think it's time you tell me where we stand 
You've been taking my love 
You've been breaking the law 
You better start making my love 
Becuase I'm in need of a miracle 
Bedded a girl in Texas 
And went all the way in Spokane 
But I love you so much 
I'm content to hold your hand 
See I ain't in no hurry 
I can't wait to be your man 
But are you breaking the law or looking out for miracles 
I think it's time you tell me where we stand 
You've been taking my love 
We've been breaking the law 
You'd better start making my love 
Because I'm in need of a miracle 

[repeat chorus] 

I took a train to Detroit 
Then I rode a train to Memphis 
I've been all around this bad bad world 
Just trying to find some tenderness 
Taking my Love 
We've been breaking the law 
You'd better start making my love 
Because I'm in need of a miracle 
See I took a train to New York 
And then I rolled into Chicago
Yeah, I've been all around this mean mean world 
Only trying to find a heart of gold
