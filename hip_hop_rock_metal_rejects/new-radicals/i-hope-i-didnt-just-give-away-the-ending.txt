She wanted to be a nun 
Until that fateful day we met 
I beat the crucifix 
In a game of Russian roulette 
I burned my Beatles records 
Because she hated number nine 
She licked rock cocaine suckers 
Laughed, said her moms doing mine 
well, are you an illusion, or am I just getting stoned 
Because I can't take it alone 
I can't take it alone 
I hope I didn't just give away the ending 
We started limping, 
Caught the handicap shuttle to town 
And yelled "God's healed us" 
As we ran off the bus the driver just frowned 
By the way this girl was sexy and she wouldn't touch you 
That may not be true 
But I said it so you'd feel involved with this song 
Are you an illusion 
Or am I just getting stoned 
Because I can't take it alone 
I can't take it alone 
I hope I didn't just give away the ending 
We caught a fey taxi driver 
I smiled the ride was free 
I felt like Amsterdam 
She wanted more drugs and maybe me 
I told her dealer I was broke 
He hired a camera man 
We did a porno film for coke 
I hear I'm big in Japan 
Are you an illusion 
Or am I just getting stoned 
Because I can't take it alone 
I can't take it alone 
I hope I didn't just give away the ending 
we went back to her kitchen 
Put the coke all in a can 
Tied up a T.V minister 
In walked her dad 
He started drinking coffee 
Too much sugar on the go 
He fell dead on the floor 
He thought the coke was sweet'n'low 
well are you an illusion 
Or am I just getting stoned 
Because I can't take it alone 
I can't take it alone 
I hope I didn't just give away the ending 
Boy was she upset but then she stole her dad's wallet and 
I drove him to the hospital 
To sell all of his donatable body parts 
And this is where she dies 
They brought the depressed junkie in 
She shot his Cyanide up 
I guess she thought it was errol flynn 
I'm blamed in the confusion 
The police being phoned 
I don't even love you 
We weren't even friends 
It's just that I can't take it alone 
Uh, huh 
I can't take it alone 
I hope I didn't just give away the ending [repeat 6 times] 
Aw Jesus, Ah s*** 
I think I just gave away the ending
