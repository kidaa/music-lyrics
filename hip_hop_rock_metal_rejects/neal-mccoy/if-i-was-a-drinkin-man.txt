J.B. Rudd/Byron Hill
If I was a drinkin' man like I used to be
I'd get myself a bottle and you'd be history
You made me a thinkin' man when you walked out
If I was a drinkin' man, I wouldn't need you now
I've learned to live without you, one day at a time
Even though you're always on my mind
There's a bar around the corner if I wanted to forget
But I ain't givin' up on our love yet
If I was a drinkin' man like I used to be
I'd get myself abottle and you'd be history
You made me a thinkin' man when you walked out
If I was a drinkin' man, I wouldn't need you now
Knowin' me like you do the kind of fool I've been
You probably think I'm three sheets to the wind
I wish that I could tell you that I'm feelin' no pain
Oh you should see how much I've changed
If I was a drinkin' man like I used to be
I'd get myself a bottle and you'd be history
You made me a thinkin' man when you walked out
If I was a drinkin' man I wouldn't need you now
If I was a drinkin' man I wouldn't need you now
