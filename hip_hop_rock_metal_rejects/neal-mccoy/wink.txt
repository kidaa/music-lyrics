I woke up this morning my head felt dense
I splashed it with water trying to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen she was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
Well it's her way of saying she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin' and I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
In this complicated world it may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cures
Pushed to the limit or standing at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
