Friend I can't believe you called me over here tonight
Thinkin' I might recognize that girl out on the floor
I must admit she looks just like someone I used to know
That was so long ago thanks for your concern
But that's not her
'Cause she'd be dancin' in my arms starin' into my eyes
Holdin' me close the way that she's holdin' him
Talkin' 'bout forever like we were still together
Sayin' I love you over and over again
She looks like an angel for sure but that's not her
If that was really her you know
Then nothing would have changed
She'd still be in love with me like I'm in love with her
You think you know just who she is
But things aren't what they seem
I would give anything if they really were
But that's not her
'Cause she'd be dancin' in my arms starin' into my eyes
Holdin' me close the way that she's holdin' him
Talkin' 'bout forever like we were still together
Sayin' I love you over and over again
She looks like an angel for sure but that's not her
