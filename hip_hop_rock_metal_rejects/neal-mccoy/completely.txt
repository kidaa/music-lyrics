Marc Beeson/Jeff Wood
Before you I was totally lost and so
Hopelessly sure I'd end up by myself
I was so unaware there was someone
Out there for me who'd look at me like nobody else
You gave me somethin' that I always wanted
And I'm givin' it all back to you
Darlin' completely with all of my soul
I was so empty ''til you made me whole
And girl you complete me more every day
I promise forever to love me this way
Right from the start I'll give you my heart
Darlin' completely
I did time as a single man year after year
And then right when I almost gave up
Way up high on the ledge leaning over the edge
I was mercifully saved by your love
It might take a lifetime but I know I'll find
The right words to tell you that I'm yours
Darlin' completely with all of my soul
I was so empty ''til you made me whole
And girl you complete me more every day
I promise forever to love me this way
Right from the start I'll give you my heart
Darlin' completely
You gave me somethin' I always wanted
I'm givin' it all back to you
