Gerry House/Bob Dipiero
That song came out back in '62
Way way before there was you and me
The guy who sang it wore a sharkskin suit
Had Elvis like hair and Italian boots
Somebody new brought it back again
It don't sound much like it did back then
The melody still makes that magic dust
When it touched you 'n me now we fell in love
That song is a timeless thing
Make a man give a woman a diamond ring
Two hearts singin' along
Can make it rain champagne
Make that old moon glow
Down on lover's lane
There's lipstick on the radio
It's only music and it's only words
But that's us baby in every verse
Fifty years from now on our anniversary day
I'll know just what to tell that band to play
That song is a timeless thing
Make a man give a woman a diamond ring
Two hearts singin' along
Can make it rain champagne
Make that old moon glow
Down on lover's lane
There's lipstick on the radio
Down on lover's lane
There's lipstick on the radio
