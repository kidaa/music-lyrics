lyrics: LoSicco '96
I am the word of hate made flesh
Demon Black immortal soul
Genesisat a pool of stinking filth
And again the images unfurl
From me the crimson strings unfold to infinite lengths and points untold
To conquer time alone by willto BEforever more
Apoditic evil in the arms of the Unlight
Tribesmen turn from Starside skies
and venture not unto the north.
As doctrine to their lives
a fear of death or worse
Cimmerian recursive soul.the force from which the fountain flows
tributaries in worlds beyond to snuff the lie of light
Enslaved creation molding man as mine or be destroyed
Sheathing drops which fall to earth
and freeze within the night
Sculpt the northern towers high
antithetic windswept plains
From behind the eyes, from within I writhe
With preternatural sense I feel the scarlet flow of life nearby
To mesmerize
The hypnotic beauty in these eyes,
Seek in me and you'll find
The truth you so design
Brilliant infinity
I'll send you on your way
From me the crimson strings unfold to infinite lengths and points untold
To conquer time alone by willto BEforever more
Apoditic evil in the arms of the Unlight
