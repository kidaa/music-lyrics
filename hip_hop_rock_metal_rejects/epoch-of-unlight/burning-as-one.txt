Lyrics: LoSicco '97-'98
[A] Candle black in silver stand with wind-kissed flame on wick
Casts a flickering shadow of the ancient one
Whose slowly moving presence toward the hoary tower casement
Ascends to view outside his manse the scene revealed below
Legions align on the red high land hills
Not as one but as many
[Once] warriors for she and now warriors for none
Conflict in lust for the night
Eyes with age unknown stare on at wheels, which turn below
And so the scene repeats itself for he who watches all
And unknown to those at odds in arms below
A card was played one yet unseen
Fools carry on in their bittersweet rage
Salacious desire to have all
Failure to them, while unknown is their fate
For Night has Her chosen one
That which does not
Become part
Of the one shall
Become void
First to feel the burning rays, to see the lie in light
First too she who wrapped my wounds and healed in pale Unlight
[Chorus]
I am that
Which can not end
And from whom they all have come
Divided to
Dethrone her son
Now they shall all Burn As One
First to feel the burning rays, to see the lie in light
First too she who wrapped my wounds and healed in pale Unlight

Desirea carnal needto force upon their will
Purginga bloodline's endcleansed in flame
[Chorus]
Alone now
My will be done
Unchallenged again in might
Set at odds
Those who once were
And will never be again
Divided to
Dethrone her son
United Burning As One
