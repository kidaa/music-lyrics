lyrics: LoSicco '96
Deeper Down I lie, and in it all the night
That I may never see, what's become of me.
The wolveshowl aboveyet for Ithe peace that was once now has passed
The calecherattles byand again
the sustenance of life  continues on its path
A dark trip with nothing more to see
The immortal soul's final destiny
The enlightenment undoes the self
Ancient waysin infinite chaos unfoldsunwilling yet to see
Infinite scenes on my canvas are scrolled
A Predacious creaturewith only a mind to feedThe lust that wells withinBecomes as faltered as the seed
That Germinateswithin barren and arid soila wanton desire to be
Fought by nature and all her course
A discourseupon the lie untoldThat I may remove the self
And with it all the duplicities of old
Sacrariumwithin the mud and clayyet still with heightened awarenessI sense the passing of the day
Into duskand further into nightagain my mistress calls me
To be with what is mine by right
Winnowing
Images
Like Life so flows the lie
Spuriosity
Embracing Me
Interring Me
I am undone within
 I have seen one thousand twilights besmeared by western paling lights
And in their wake the primal forces gathered to unite as one
The time of darkness is upon us finally to cleanse the brood
My pride, my will, my lust unending will return me to the world
For unto me
chaos rapture
I was never to be
whole again
undone within
