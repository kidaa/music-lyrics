Come on, come on
Yeah
Feel good don't it?
This is for warm days
And drift away
While the sun sets
And the ghettos play
Long nights on
A hot summer's block
When you sip yo brew
And never touch yo glock
This is for eyes
That cry like yours and learn
To smile again
Rise above the pain
This is for you and your crew
The ones that's true
Will always love you
No matter what you do

CHORUS:
'Cause it's the life
The life, the life
The life, the life
It's the life, the life
The life, life
It's the life, the life
The life, yo life, yo life
It's the life
Your life, my life

This is for soldiers
Who bust they guns
Bust, bust
In the name of freedom
Not the game of fun
True Queens
Who raise they kids
Zemplement the knowledge
Show 'em how to live
This is for those
Who stand in line and
Feed their babies I know
While were runnin'
Out of time
This is for the
Injustice behind bars
Our lovers, our leaders
Our people
Our people

Repeat chorus

Don't let 'em
Mis, misguide you
They'll have you actin'
Like the sun don't shine
And the sky
Ain't never blue
But you know and
I know it's all about survival
This struggle of our people
Is like that unrivalled
The politicans they
Was never in control
Never
It's deeper then that
A true battle for the soul
What they want is to
Bring us to our knees
So my people guard
Yo life by any means

This is for those
Who know we all gon' die
And said a bad way
By a infinite prize
Those that know
Who feel the change
In the belly of the best
And the ment of strange
This is for those who have
Their own fallen angels
Tryna find a way on
This is for everybody
Everybody
And everybody is so life

Repeat chorus

Yo, you gotta keep smilin'
No matter what
'Cause this is the life
What you gon' do
'Bout that, huh?
Yo, A-Plus
