Music: Durkin/Hoglan, Lyrics: Durkin/Rinehart
Reality has come to call
A modern-day plague upon us all
As we've come to pass and deal with strife
Afflicted ailments dissipate life
For all false prophets predict time of doom
The demise of man shall come too soon
With each passing of the dying day
The false ones predict and finally say,
We are...
chorus
Never to rise again
Never to rise again
We are never to rise again
Never to rise again
The time for peace for all is dead
The coming of christ--"I'm here," he said
With each passing monarch depressions' tool
The people submit to the false one's rule
As the world turns now in reverse
Honesty in life shall be dispersed
With each passing of the dying day
The false ones predict and finally say,
We are...
Never to rise again
Never to rise again
We are never to rise again
Never to rise again
We look to the sky in a constant wonder
With ideals collide and bring us under
Veils of death lifes' mystery
Profits are claimed but never seen
All that we ask is life to share
Free from hatred, pain, despair
With each passing of the dying day
The false ones predict and finally say,
We are...
Never to rise again
Never to rise again
We are never to rise again
Never to rise again
