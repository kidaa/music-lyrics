Music: Durkin/Hoglan, Lyrics: Hoglan
FEAR
The world now stands ancient, showing her age
Antique, senile, archaic
Peroration impending, not one to assuage
The human remnants of earth
Pandemic winds chill the soul
Eradication of the will
Nihilism extracts its toll
Frightening the meekly servile
Sacrosanct, the religious ones
Are fast becoming extinct
Choatic precursors of what will befall
Permeate the night air
The fear of the end preys on the minds
Of all the soon-to-be dead
With death at the hands of a hideous fiend
A grisly fate to comprehend
DEATH
chorus
This city is guilty
The crime is life
The sentence is death
Darkness descends
repeat 3 times
FIRE
Internal combustion, plutonic rage
The bodies create their own hell
The flame from within, unleashed from its cage
Purging the great sins of all
Admissions of guilt are all that are sought
By judges who have twisted laws
The quick abrogation of the populace
Striking with great enmity
Listing the ways in which we will die
As the prophets claim we will soon
Self-immolation that unjustified
Stygian shores ahead loom
The coffins are ready, the death warrant signed
Depression has swiftly set in
Inimical powers against humankind
This charnelhouse ensanguined
DEATH
chorus
This city is guilty
The crime is life
The sentence is death
Darkness descends
repeat 3 times

MORTIS
Decaying, the ruins fall swift to the ground
The carnage is morbid and great
Mephitic deathstench of corpses abound
The earth meets an untimely fate
The horrific malignance, spreading its wings
Across the expanse of the sky
Contamination and all that it brings
The judges commit genocide
Retaliation, a useless ploy
We've gazed into the face of fear
We know that it stands for our own bitter end
The end we realize is now here
The claws of denouement grasp at our lungs
Asphyxiation rules supreme
The future of mankind cut down while they're young
Our children die clutching their dreams...
DEATH
This city is guilty
The crime is life
The sentence is death
Darkness descends
