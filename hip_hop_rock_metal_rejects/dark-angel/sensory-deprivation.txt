Music: Hoglan/Eriksen, Lyrics: Hoglan
Potentially there's no safety
Inside these walls, I'm forced to be
Unprotected to cruelty
I'm not at my own mercy
The most important time in my life
Is governed by an unstable mind
On another I depend
My own life I can't defend
chorus
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
Incarcerated and force-fed
Your disparity a constant threat
Are you qualified to reign?
Is my destruction pre-ordained?
I am not a parasite
Will I be punished by your spite?
I await my destiny
And possibly your enmity
chorus
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
bridge
Completely under your dominion
I'm not here of my own volition, no
lead-Brett
lead-Eric
chorus
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
I'm locked away, a nonentity
Sacrificed by antipathy
My pleas aren't heard
So I'm tortured
It's perilous in this domain
And I'm dead if I remain
I pray that you
Don't cause my doom...
chorus
Will I survive?
To see the day arrive
When I am cast forth
And endangered nevermore
