Music: Durkin/Meyer, Lyrics: Hoglan/Durkin/Don Doty
Once, the tale of Sodom
Brought anguish to the eyes
Of all god-fearing people
With eternal afterlives
Sin and lust run rampant now
Perversion on the rise
Reliving all the ways of old
Gommorrah realized
Sodom, an unholy place
Angels searched for a few
Souls who'd yet to fall from grace
To save them from the doom
Paradise of pleasures lost
Herein the future lies
Laughing at the "holy cross"
As death rained from the skies
chorus
Falling from the heavens
Angels lie decayed
Burning, city of Sodom
One by one, sinners pay
Skeptics failed to heed the call
Of angels sent to tell
Of the impending death to all
In blazing city hell
Consorting with the demons craft
The ways of god repelled
Burning cross, cause to laugh
Lot, the one expelled
chorus
Falling from the heavens
Angels lie decayed
Burning, city of Sodom
One by one, sinners pay

The sufferers' impalement
Inside the city gates
Worshipping the holy priests
The masters of all hate
The flag of the inverted cross
Menacing, held high
Laughing at the "holy cross"
At twelve, the virgin dies!!
Our righteous family did escape
The family-father lot
Sinful daughters succumbed to rape
Not as holy as thought!!
Mankind throughout eternity
Built on evils' designs
The resilience of iniquity
Lives on in christian minds
chorus
Falling from the heavens
Angels lie decayed
Burning, city of Sodom
One by one, sinners pay!!!
