Music: Durkin/Hoglan, Lyrics: Hoglan
What have we done?!?
The box has been opened--we fall
Three words are unleashed to plague us to the end
Stick around and witness our demise
The human condition, read "you give and I'll take"
It seems older than time itself
We've established what we have here
Avarice, greed and malice rule the mind
The strongest emotions, conquering even fear
No barrier impossible to climb
When a human is given the opportunity to flaunt his greed
He spares no expense at the task
His avidity is dominant, covetousness too prominent
Taking without bothering to ask
chorus
Let him burn!!
His actions are primordial he's never gonna learn
Make him bleed!!
Reciprocation his just reward
Maturity!!
Is sorely lacking and in evidence of complete failure
And so it goes!!
He's a victim of his own greed
This behavior is intrinsic
Patterned after animals who've killed their prey
Inherent line of conduct, placing "want" before "need"
Material objects of desire what you crave
There's no woman alive whose goal is merely to survive
Her generation screams to "have it all"
Her wanton lust of finer things, this attitude it only brings
Down her breed and casts a pall
chorus
Let her burn!!
Her actions are primordial she's never gonna learn
Make her bleed!!
Reciprocation her just reward
Maturity!!
Is sorely lacking and in evidence of complete failure
And so it goes!!
She's a victim of her own greed
Can't you see it's never-ending?
Humanity's rapaciousness is firm
"The competitive edge" is now a mass psychosis
A dementia with which we must come to term
An instinctive trait of action is this crippling malefaction
The multitudes with their malignity
Maliciousness a facet of existence as we know it
Mankind its own atrocity
chorus
Let them burn!!
Their actions are primordial they're never gonna learn
Make them bleed!!
Reciprocation their just reward
Maturity!!
Is sorely lacking and in evidence of complete failure
And so it goes!!
They are victims of their own greed
"Give it to me"
An open palm receiving at each opportunity
"Give it to me"
Take advantange of each others' generosity
"Give it to me"
A selfishness mutation turns to mordacity
"Give it to me"
What will it take to put a stop to all this gluttony?
"Take everything from me"
The other side gives acquiescence to proclivity
"Take it from me"
Closing their eyes to the plague with increudulity
"Take everything from me"
Though burdened with the pain of your insensitivity
"Take it from me"
The earth is doomed to self-destruct from the voracity!!
You want, you need
With your enormous greed
Insatiable, your hunger will not cease
The gain you seek
The havoc that you wreak
Avarice, your self-control is weak
Self-indulgence is the key
The pathetic life you lead
All-consuming adolescent fantasy
You'd better grow up fast
'Cause this life will never last
And you'll be the last one to see!!
SOLO: MEYER
Christ, I wish I had the answer!
I must admit, I'm only human, too
I'm surely not above looking out for myself
It's an attitude I know I must improve
When a human is given the opportunity to flaunt his greed
He spares no expense at the task
His avidity is dominant, covetousness too prominent
Taking without bothering to ask
chorus
Let us burn!!
Our actions are primordial we're never gonna learn
Make us bleed!!
Reciprocation our just reward
Maturity!!
Is sorely lacking and in evidence of complete failure
And so it goes!!
We are victims of our own greed
What have we done?
The box has been opened--we fall
Three words are unleashed to plague us to the end
Stick around and witness our demise
This world we inhabit, all our attitudes are fake
We're only here to preserve our own wealth
The human condition, read "you give and I'll take"
It seems older than time itself!!
