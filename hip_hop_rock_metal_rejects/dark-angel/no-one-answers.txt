Music: Durkin/Hoglan, Lyrics: Hoglan
As you enter your realm of incorruption,
The values of morality in their pristine state.
The walls that surround you in a gentle caress,
Protect you from a world of hate.
And the Earth is full of lurid madmen,
Misogynists abound waiting to produce your fall.
But the being you should most fear when you turn out the lights,
Is in no way human at all.
A puritan soul, distanced from sin,
A libertine's ways never for you.
But now you've no choice in this carnival game,
A toy to be done with what I choose.
As you struggle to break this invisible grip,
Your consternation growing into fright.
Awake but entranced by a force that's unknown,
But very real on this night.
chorus
No one answers!
To the cries in the middle of your dreams.
No one answers!
To the cries rapidly becoming screams.
No one answers!
Though you're forced to perform against your will.
No one answers!
So shut up and accept your fate!!
You recoil in revulsion, but that will soon pass,
As you rebel to my sensual skill.
Non-compliance won't do, you will truly serve me well,
Or I'll have no choice but to kill.
It's the way that I work, it's the way that I am,
I'm selfish, my needs are quite great.
Exhibiting my power over the weaker, fairer sex,
My leviathan desires to satiate.
chorus
Aha what is this? you're begining to relent?
As I have said, none resist my charm.
Your confession of faith is far behind you now,
And to think at the start you were alarmed!
I am your savior, you await my return,
Your libidinous urges long repressed.
What I do to you is unhumanly possible,
I've now introduced you to your future ways...
