Calling out to you
I dreamed your face
Calling out to you
I'll see you tonight
Tonight

Even if I run to you
Your touch would be elusive
Even if I surrender
The war would not be over
Even if I bless for you
My heart would go on beating
If I had my faith from you
This love would feel no shame
Cause I know
There's a place for me
Where you and I can dance
Oh I know
There's a place for me
You will be there, take me there You're the one
It's your love pulling me back
Calling me back
I'm gonna run to you You're the one
It's your love that keeps on pulling me back
Calling me back
I'm gonna run to you baby
I'm gonna run

Take a turn and walk away
Pretending we're dreaming
Confess that we're satisfied
And know what we're seeing
Oh we can take a chance tonight
And lane it to the morning
We can hold each other's hand
Together face the fight
And I know
There's a place
Where everyone will dance
Yes I know
There's a place for me
And you will be there, please take me there You're the one
It's your love pulling me back
Calling me back
And I'm gonna run to you You're the one
It's your love
It keeps on just pulling me back
Calling me back
It's your love, it's your love You're the one
It keeps on pulling me back
Calling me back
I'm gonna run to you baby
It's your love
It keeps on just pulling me back
Calling me back
And baby I know
There's a place for me
Where everyone will dance
Yes I know
There's a place for me
Yes you and you and you will be there
Come on leading to me baby
Breathing to me
You can lean on me
Just lean on me baby
You know
It will just happen...
