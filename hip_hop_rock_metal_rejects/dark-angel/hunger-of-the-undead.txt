Music: Durkin/Meyer/Hoglan, Lyrics: Hoglan
I walk through deaths' door
I'm frightened to see
A determined fate is not in store for me
No light in the tunnel
Or brimstone awaits
Return to the earth
A reincarnate
My life
Meant others had to suffer in my wake
My hatred proved too much for god to take
My soul is set to live in disrespect
Karmas' retribution--lifes' reject
Is what I'm meant to be
An outcast from society??
A laughing stock--as I walk the earth
Vindication laughs at my rebirth
Or will I be a victim of the thing
Commonly known as eternity??
Eternally black
In limbo I'm trapped
In silence I sound a plea
Light is no more
I feel not a thing
Undead, I need to break free
Listen
The silence deafens all the unheard screams
The darkness rips away all the unseen dreams
Numbmess shrouds my soul I'm left to roam
Paralysis now my only home
Spiritual planes do not exist
Life in this realm I will resist
And break these bonds--These chains that lock my soul
Watch my growing fire burst through the wall
I need to grasp the earthen world again
Onto the realm of humans I'll ascend
Hunger
Of the undead
Now if my soul is mine then why will you not let it be free??
I wonder
When this will all end
To live in this shell makes me laugh at religious disease
Who'd think that
There's no hell or heaven??
Only an abscence of god and no satan supposedly fell
A spirits'
Reincarnation
Is the proof of no heaven or merciless torment of hell.....

I walk through lifes' door
I'm frightened to see
A determined fate is now in store for me
A leper I stand
A pitiful scene
Martyred, by my impiety
Believe me
The vicious circle has triumphed again
And now a life of agony I'll begin
The fates have dealt the hand I'm set to play
A losing situation in every way
I know I'm meant to be
An outcast from society
And live my days banished from the race
Reborn into this life of much disgrace
My soul is set to live in disrespect
Karmas' retribution--lifes' reject!!
