Music: Hoglan/Durkin, Lyrics: Hoglan
Back when man had not care for the past
And little hope for the future
A man who stood out in the annals of time
To tell of the actions to come
The uncanny words of a clinical mind
Turn of centuries bore his truth
A mysterious being with a curious gift
Nostradamus--chosen one
His talent for reaching with a gaze
Into the future unknown
Conclusions drawn from inner haze
As the seeds of time were sewn
The fires, the plagues, the "men of blood"
Foretold by prophetic eye
Scourges upon lands he never stood
Predicting our race to die
Seeing the days
Of hideous plague
When nature released disease upon human race
The damage was done
Black death had won
Pestilence, the start of armageddon
Torment and fire
London expired
The English lands became a massive funeral pyre
Ruinous blaze
The city was razed
Due to the great London's fire, life was denied
Now the people today understand and take heed
His truthful words of the future they've seen
chorus
The one who knew
Where we'd stand
In centuries ahead of where he roamed the land
He'd seen the fear
Upon the earth
Hatred, death, and pain, four-hundred years worth
A witness to
Brutality
And evil warmongers insanity
His written words
Upon the page
Black prophecies!!
Nostradamus envisioned saviours of hate
To reign subservient mass
Attempting to alert us before it's too late
We witnessed the evil that passed
We watched all the wretched torment inflicted
And shook our heads with grief
And understood then what the seer predicted
Beyond our conscious belief
At war with a sick brain, Hitler was known
To render a massive injustice
Striking the Hebrews a mighty deathblow
Guaranteeing his fate in the abyss
The wars, the concentration camps
Foretold, prophetic eye
When the doomsayer became entranced
He saw when our race will die
Sinister minds
Hate had then blind
To the slaughter of innocent people--insidious crime
Walking the earth
The devil's rebirth
The fuhrer the second son, Napoleon being the first
Both antichrists
Brought anguish and strife
Ruling the empires with a criminal sickening spite
Gaseous showers
With Hitler empowered
Innocent Jewish honor forever raped and deflowered
Now the people today understand and take heed
His truthful words of the future they've seen
chorus
The one who knew
Where we'd stand
In centuries ahead of where he roamed the land
He'd seen the fear
Upon the earth
Hatred, death, and pain, four-hundred years worth
A witness to
Brutality
And evil warmongers insanity
His written words
Upon the page
Black prophecies!!
GUITAR SOLO: J. DURKIN
Back when man had not care for the past
And little hope for the future
A man who stood out in the annals of time
To tell of the actions to come
The uncanny words of a clinical mind
Turn of centuries bore his truth
A mysterious being with a curious gift
Nostradamus--chosen one
His talent for reaching with a gaze
Into the future unknown
Conclusions drawn from inner haze
As the seeds of time are sewn
In the year 1999 and seven months
>From the sky will come the great king of terror
Nostradamus watches from beyond
Waiting for our race to die
Third war
Final scar
Soon the obliteration will be total, leaving no more
Milleneum two
Will not be renewed
The bodies, corpses and souls will then be exhumed
Nuclear fire
The earth has expired
The worldy lands became a massive funeral pyre
Ruinous blaze
The landscape is razed
Due to the nuclear winters' frost, life is denied
Now the people today understand and take heed
His truthful words of the future they've seen
chorus
The one who knew
Where we'd stand
In centuries ahead of where he roamed the land
He'd seen the fear
Upon the earth
Hatred, death, and pain, four-hundred years worth
A witness to
Brutality
And evil warmongers insanity
His written words
Upon the page
Black prophecies!!!...
