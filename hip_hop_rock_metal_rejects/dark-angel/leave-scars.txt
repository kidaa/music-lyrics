Music: Hoglan/Durkin, Lyrics: Hoglan
I am an angel of darkness
Abhorrent to those who are frail
The strength inside me is my will to believe
In myself, with no self-betrayal
My force is my own preservation
My destiny mine to control
I don't live my life to be judged by anyone
Surviving intact is my role
Lost time is never found again
Screaming through my life of speed--insanity, mach ten
I utilize the life I've been given
Or else it's as if I've never been
I take pains to make my presence known
If it's a negative impression then I'll take the blame alone
I have no regrets and I call my life my own
I have no time for the words left in stone
chorus
I acknowledge only one thing;
My own authority
Answering to no one, I leave no trace of pity
My independence rules my life
I can't help what you are
For this I won't apologize
Because I leave scars!!
I promise you agony
If you attempt to intervene
Just pay attention to yourself, you're barely existing
I'm thriving on the life I lead
A veteran of human wars
For this I won't apologize...
Because I leave scars!!
I practice angelic darkness
My convictions keep wolves from my door
I know what it means to have someone tamper with my dreams
Deflowering my essence, my core
I once sought no recrimination
But now I seek the price be paid
Forever wary, always guarded against anyone
Who's mistaken me for easy prey
Defeatist attitudes are only in vain
As you wonder of my species--must I really be explained?
Realize now that I'm ingrained
Knowingly, forever on your brain
Nemeses falter in their plebian ways
Employing methods to usurp my reign, my inner maze
Seeking clues to uncover the clever turn of phrase
Salient words are found amidst the haze
chorus
I acknowledge only one thing;
My own authority
Answering to no one, leave no trace of pity
My independence rules my life
I can't help what you are
For this I won't apologize
Because I leave scars!!
I promise you agony
If you attempt to intervene
Just pay attention to yourself, you're barely existing
I'm thriving on the life I lead
A veteran of human wars
For this I won't apologize
Because I leave scars!!
A mercenary I may be, I tend to feel I'm not
My only need is to maintain my lot
I have a lust for life that stands to be my legacy
I'm proud to say, "with my life, I am free"
To leave a mark, necessity, my memory redeemed
I suffer not from lack of self-esteem
Someday my confidence will be a mass contagion
I assure you this is no self-exaltation
I cicatrize myself upon your mind
You won't forget my actions as you will find
I'm lord and master
Of my own future!!
SOLO: DURKIN
SOLO: MEYER
I am the darkest of angels!!
Indomitable in my will to succeed
I have a goal to ascertain
Entrenching myself upon your brain
These words I've bled upon this page
Have come from inside, how quickly I've aged
My innocence has died and was buried long ago
Eternally joined with a part of my soul
The weak of heart need not apply
I admit they're not for all--my caffeinated ways of life
Those who oppose me will end in bitter strife
Defacing human minds until I die
Those with open minds will benefit from my vows
A self-betrothal where I pay no heed to sacred cows
Further discussion time will not allow
Until we meet I'll take my bow
And remember...
I acknowledge only one thing;
My own authority
Answering to no one, leave no trace of pity
My independence rules my life
I can't help what you are
For this I won't apologize
Because I leave scars!!
I promise you agony
If you attempt to intervene
Just pay attention to yourself, you're barely existing
I'm thriving on the life I lead
A veteran of human wars
For this I won't apologize...
Because I leave scars!!
