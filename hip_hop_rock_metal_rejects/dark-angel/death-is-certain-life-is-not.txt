Music: Durkin/Hoglan/Yahn/Meyer, Lyrics: Hoglan
Respecting your wishes
My brother, you wish to die
In a bed surrounded by tubes
Immobility's cast its shadow
In your body numbness reigns
You've calculated your demise
Your future racked with pain
I'll take the life behind your eyes
There was a time when death was distant
And the fire of life burned bright
Now we realize life's no constant
No will to life, death's a right
Euthanasia, not murder
Act of mercy to escape
Society's form of torture
To let you live this way
chorus
Death is certain
Life is not
Your mind's in torment
Waiting to rot
The final curtain
Always draws it close
When death is certain
The end unfolds
From the neck down, you're senseless
From the neck up, you're alive
And the politics of humanity
Refuse to let you die
And all the while you plot your death
With me at your side
Your last wish, your brain to rest
Your bondage ropes untied
And the prayer for miracles is through
For there's no god to care
Do unto others as done to you
Without a doubt he isn't there
I won't make a mistake with faith
Christ's a waste of time
How can I put my trust in god
With innocent people dying?
chorus

HARMONY SOLO
Paralytic disease infests your brain
Debilitates your mind
A vegetable wasting, decaying
You're running out of time
All I know is what you said
Before the comas' grip
Don't want to live your life brain dead
To death you crave to slip
The needle's pulled from in your arm
The pulse of life has stopped
Your granted plea, a painless death
To arrive at the end you'd sought
The cryptic statement--bonded truth
Lie peaceful in your grave
Did we just give up on you?
I hope you have been saved.....
chorus
Death is certain
Life is not
Your mind lies dormant
Proceeding to rot
The final curtain
Has drawn its close
When death is certain
The end unfolds!!!............
