Music: Hoglan/Eriksen, Lyrics: Hoglan
A shadow, I prowl these decadent streets,
Perversion, degradation my soulmates.
An observer, I'm admist the innocent weak,
My fascinations are salacious and unchaste.
This netherworld of carnality is my existance,
I don't walk alone, for this is my home,
And my subsistence.
I silently drift through these darkened paths,
I'm a witness to human psyche in decay.
There's nothing here but burnt-out bodies and souls,
A breeding ground for the depraved.
I've plunged beyond the sickest depths of pruriency,
What is normal to me is far beneath what is seen as
mere "obscenity".
chorus
Can you feel the pain
Of these souls deranged?
Can you feel the pain
I have lived inside
These pathetic minds
And it's menacing
Psychosis
And lust is
So dangerous
Sexuality
At its most diseased
Has enslaved us...
I wish I could give you severe details,
But now's not the time nor the place.
I've sojourned through the vilest combat zones,
And been invovled in acts that are debased.
Virtuous lives are crushed in this malevolent den of thieves,
There's no escape from the abduction and rape
of virginity.
Scenic nightmares of brutal self-indulgence,
Nothing is sacred, especially life.
I completely share my amorality,
With the hookers and the hustlers that stalk the night.
Shocking, disgusting displays of human indignities,
Anything can be achieced in sexual iniquities.
chorus
Can you feel the pain
Of these souls deranged?
Can you feel the pain
I have lived inside
These pathetic minds
And it's menacing
Psychosis
And lust is
So dangerous
Sexuality
At its most diseased
Has enslaved us...
I've been seduced into this realm,
Why? I cannot say...
I've cleansed myself from all that's pure,
I've now incurred disgrace.
I can't put my finger on the attraction,
I'm not an anomaly.
In my domain of abomination,
Psychosexualuty...
I have a personal obsession with pain,
Dealing, receiving, to me it's the same,
It's a tragic game
Excruciation that goes unrestrained,
To others this pleasure may be insane,
Or at the least profane
Virgins forced to perform unspeakable deeds,
Immaculate youth placed in impurity.
The screams of pain, I have heard the screams
Of quiet exits, but forced entry.
Desperate souls of one accord,
With their lives in this sordid world
Women defiled for that vein-numbing fix,
Bestiality, this is sick.
Orifices committing disgust,
Grotesque forays into macabre lusts.
Why am I here? I've been drawn,
In this shameless world I belong...
chorus
Can you feel the pain
Of these souls deranged?
Can you feel the pain
I have lived inside
These pathetic minds
And it's menacing
Psychosis
And lust is
So dangerous
Sexuality
At its most diseased
Has enslaved us...

lead-Eric
Men who pluck children from their families,
Teaching a man's "rules" to this younger breed.
To the black-market, parents sell their young under eight,
Anything older out here is too late,
Adolescence their fate...
Snuff films with their discreet mutiliations,
Anonymous fiends and confused, unwilling victims.
Desecrating unblemished bodies and minds,
Breaking and torturing, then ending their lives,
I have watched them die...
You've been given a glimpse of this pornographic scene,
Some of it scares me, all of it excites me.
This is my horrible, demented hell,
Once you're trapped down here I wish you well.
Why am I here? I've been drawn,
But honestly, do I belong?...
chorus
Can you feel the pain
Of these souls deranged?
Can you feel the pain
I've been trapped inside
These pathetic minds
And it's menacing
Psychosis
And lust is
So dangerous
Sexuality
At its most diseased
Has enslaved us...
