You are the only one I need 
And you mean everything to me 
I can't get you out of my mind 
You've got the face I want to see 
Yours is a 
Your never in when I'm around 
I come round 
When I turn up you turn tie me down 
If you lie to me I believe you 
Yes I have to believe you 
Stop if you've got love 
Take all your faith and make it good 
Bow down surrender 
Follow love 
And make it yours 
For ever more 
Why don't you 
Stop if you've got love 
Don't lose this race it's just too good 
I hope it's me you're thinking of 
Because I feel the need 

You never know what's going on 
But you tell me that I am wrong 
If it was up to me I would leave you 
But it isn't, I believe you 

I would do anything I could 
Just to make sure you understood 
It seems to me you understood 
That I wouldn't ever deceive you 
Though I'd want to, I could not do 

Stop if you've got love 
Take all your faith and make it good 
Bow down surrender 
Follow love 
And make it yours 
For ever more 
Why don't you 
Stop if you've got love 
Don't lose this race it's just too good 
I hope it's me you're thinking of 
Because I feel the need
