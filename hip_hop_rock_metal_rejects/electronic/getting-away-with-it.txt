I've been walking in the rain just to get wet on purpose 
I've been forcing myself not to forget just to feel worse 
I've been getting away with it all my life getting away 
However I look it's clear to see 
That I love you more than you love me 

I hate that mirror, it makes me feel so worthless 
I'm an original sinner but when I'm with you couldn't care less 

I've been getting away with it all my life 
Getting away with it all my life 

I thought I gave up falling in love a long long time ago 
I guess I like it but I can't tell you, you shouldn't really know 
And it's been true all my life 
Yes, it's been true all my life 

I've been talking to myself just to suggest that I'm selfish 
Getting ahead 
I've been trying to impress that more is less and I'm repressed 
I should do what he said 

Getting away with it...
