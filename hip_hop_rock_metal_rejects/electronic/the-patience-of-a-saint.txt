Talking of my attributes, the things I do so well 
As anyone who's in cahoots with me will readily tell 
I've lived up here, I've been down there, 
I've bought so I could sell 
And if I drove a faster car, 
I'd drive it bloody well 
How can I change? 
I live without restraint 
And I would try the patience of a saint 

Thinking of my attitudes, talking one on one 
I may disagree with you, 
But look where you've come from 
And all that you've got, 
I thought that I would faint 

But I would try the patience of a saint 
And I would try the patience of a saint 
I would try the patience of a saint 

I'm talking to myself to myself 
I'm talking to the one that I know best 

Bury me with gratitude, you can go to hell 
Why should I care? 
I'd rather watch drying paint 

But I would try the patience of a saint 
And I would try the patience of a saint 
I would try the patience of a saint 
And I would try the patience... ...of a saint
