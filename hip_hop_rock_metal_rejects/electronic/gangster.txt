It's not the way that you would listen 
Or the way you comb your hair 
It's the fact that you are missing 
How I feel when you're not there 
I went through all the months of January 
Locked up in this cell 
I'd like to be at home, but on my own 
I didn't do too well 
Look at me, I always get the blame 
But I can't even learn to spell my name 
I like to read, I like to write 
But where I live I learn to fight 
So don't you ever say that we're the same 

I don't need a doctor telling me I'm full of juice 
It's not a statement that I'm making, but the plain and simple truth 
I went through all the months of January 
Locked up in my cell I'd like to think of home, when I'm alone It doesn't work too
well
