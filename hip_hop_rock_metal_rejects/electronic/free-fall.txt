Close you lips 
We shouldn't speak of this 
I'm not the first person to know 
It's only me 
Out in the cold 
Let me feel joy 
I really need it 
rush in my blood 
I want to feel it 
And I'm sure 
When it's begun 
One into two 
Always leaves one 

Look at the rain 
Look at it falling 
Into my world 
Why are you calling 
Won't you come home 
I will not hurt you 
Will not deserve you 
Will not desert you 
Look at the rain 

Can't you see 
you were so indiscreet 
Stole all the change off me 
How could I know that you would cheat? 
Is it what I've done, 
I could be, I could become? 
I don't need someone else 
This is me, beside myself 

Look at the rain 
Look at it falling 
Into my world 
Why are you calling 
Won't you come home 
I will not hurt you 
Will not deserve you 
Will not desert you 
Look at the rain
