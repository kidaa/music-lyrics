Early morning 
With a sigh 
She opens both her eyes 
Praying for a safe return 
Lost in the darkest night 
This day the jury has adjourned 
Her love has taken flight 
She is coming home 
To visit me tonight 
She is coming home 
To visit me tonight 

Come to me and see my endeavor 
Like a leaf she falls to the ground 
In the dust that gathers forever 
We are spirits 
Making no sound 
That make no sound 
We make no sound 

She is coming home 
To visit me tonight 
She is coming home 
To visit me tonight 

Taken from the arms of another 
Woken from the deepest dream 
How can I wake her from the deepest of dreams 
Patiently she waits for her lover 
Perhaps her life is not what it seems
