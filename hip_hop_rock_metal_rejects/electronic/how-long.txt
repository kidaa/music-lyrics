I'd satisfy your every wish 
But I can't be a part of this 
You'll never forgive me 
But what do I care 
I'd like to stay but it can't be me 
It's kind of juvenile of me 
There's something I'm missing 
Why can't we agree 
I hear this sound 
For a thousand years 
Such a sad song 
It's goes forever on 

And though I try to change my mind 
So much of you I can't define 
Whenever You're near me 
Whatever you do 
I fall apart if you're not there 
I couldn't leave I wouldn't dare 
You're always within me 
Whatever you do 

I hear this sound 
For a thousand years 
Such a sad song 
It's goes forever on 

I lied to you it was a sin 
So please forgive me once again 
I'll never betray you 
As long as you're there 

I hear this sound 
For a thousand years 
Such a sad song 
It's goes forever on
