Can we meet on the street 
Maybe tomorrow 
See the world at our feet 
Naked and hollow 
I'll lead the climb crystal and fine 
For you to see 
With every step that I take 
Every rule that you make 
Stay with me 
In this foreign land 
Just enough for me 
To make you understand 

You could be 
My guiding light 
The darkest of them all 
You'd be the rise before my fall 

And yet we both get along fine 
Better than most 
Some of the time 

When I'm with you 
I am on fie 
You are the fuel 
And my desire 

Can we meet on the street 
Maybe tomorrow 
See the world at our feet 
Naked and hollow 
I'll lead the climb crystal and fine 
For you to see 
With every step that I take 
Every rule that you make 

Why do you bring 
What I can't possess 
You always ask for more 
Until there's nothing left 

These hollow words 
Make a wrong arrest 
They beat upon my door 
A spirit haunts it for ever more 

But I still hope 
And sometimes I pray 
It won't be hard 
We'll find a way 

Color my dream 
Show me I'm real 
Turn on the light 
Then let me feel 

Can we meet on the street 
Maybe tomorrow 
See the world at our feet 
Naked and hollow 
I'll lead the climb crystal and fine 
For you to see 
With every step that I take 
Every rule that you make
