I use to think that I was lonely 
When I was a young boy 
Doing what they told me 
Living rather coldly 
Too many lessons in the school class 
Stated my allegiance 
Mixing with the wrong class 
I lived at home with all my family 
Even had my own key 
It was given to me 
Parents listened to me 
Allowed to be alone 
Then left me alone 
There was never any friction 
Starring in my own film 
A starring role in my film 
It was my addiction 
It was science fiction 

You don't have to wait 
The world will carry on 
It's there in your face 
But it won't stay for long 
Let's be a nation 
And sit upon a throne 
Don't ever hesitate 
Just carry on 

The older boys were rather surly 
Living in the wrong place 
Made me grow up early 
But it was my home 
As I complete my own existence 
Staring at my own life 
I look at the old one 
Fading in the distance 
Down a semitone 

Smiling faces of the neighbors 
Proud of their endeavors 
Unemployed forever watch TV at home 

You don't have to wait 
The world will carry on 
It's there in your face 
But it won't stay for long 
Let's be a nation 
And sit upon a throne 
Don't ever hesitate 
Just carry on
