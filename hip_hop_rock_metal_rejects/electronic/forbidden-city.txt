There's not a hope 
When you're in this kind of mood 
Too much to drink 
But not enough to lose 
You tore me apart 
Now I've got to suffer 
I wish I'd been around 
When you started this 
Give me a chance 
I'll show you what I could do 
You're in a trance 
And I'm not so fond of you 
You may be a friend 
But not my relation 
You're the only person I ever knew 

And it's too late to wash my hands 
Caught in a trap set for a man 

There is a wind 
That blows in the northern sky 
Holding me back 
No matter how hard I try 
If I had the strength 
I'd leave here tomorrow 
I wouldn't even bother to say goodbye 
But it's too late to wash my hands 
Caught in a trap set for a man 

Would you lie to me 
You thought I was wrong 
You deserted me 

Would you lie to me 
You thought I was wrong 
You deserted me 
When it all went wrong 
Would you lie to me 

Would you lie to me 
You thought I was wrong 
You deserted me 
When it all went wrong 

And it's too late to wash my hands 
Caught in a trap set for a man
