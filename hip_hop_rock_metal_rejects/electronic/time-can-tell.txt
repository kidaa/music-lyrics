Your voice is breaking up 
Get off the phone 
Come and see me 
These times are hard enough 
To be alone 
I want you within me 
And much to my regret 
It's you I can't forget 
Tears on your shoulder 
Don't go too far 
Surrender me unharmed 
Then come to me 

Will we still be together 
In a year from now 
Or do we hate each other 
We're gonna get through somehow 
Has it turned the world into a nightmare 
Will it be farewell 
Only time can tell 

You'd make the angels wait 
And stop the sun 
If I let you 
What good is two when it's reduced to by one 
How do you value your love 
What is the value of love 

You'd better save your breath 
Give us both a rest 
Until tomorrow 
The second you want me 
You know I'll come 
You are the one 

Will we still be together 
In a year from now 
Or do we hate each other 
We're gonna get through somehow 
Has it turned the world into a nightmare 
Will it be farewell 
Only time can tell
