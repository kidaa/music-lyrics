Not a trace of emotion 
Remains inside 
Two hearts broken 
Lay set down by the river side 
Single handed 
They tried to escape from me you see 
With a turn of the wheel 
It was driving me 
Crazy ..... 

This love was born instead of hate 
Celebrate our love 
Let me feel the right vibration 
Celebrate our love 
And until the end of time 
Celebrate what's mine 
Make it good and let it shine 
Celebrate our love 

Revelation or faith 
I just can't decide 
Will they drown 
In the flow pull of the rising tide 
There's a side of your life 
That you never see 
It is real this ordeal 
And it's driving me 

Crazy ... 

This love was born instead of hate 
Celebrate our love 
Let me feel the right vibration 
Celebrate our love 
And until the end of time 
Celebrate what's mine 
Make it good and let it shine 
Celebrate our love
