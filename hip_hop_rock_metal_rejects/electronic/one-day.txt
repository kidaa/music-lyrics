We're in danger, so I'm told 
It's the end of time and the world is old 
You meet a stranger you don't want to see 
Dance to the sound 
Of his pen making history 
One day and it won't be long 
We'll stand in this place 
Undercover 
Licensed to be wrong 

One day and it won't be long 
We'll stand in this place 
And discover 

I'm not ashamed to tell you 
But you know it's over 
Naked is the beauty 
Crying on my shoulder 

It's hard to face rejection 
What use to be affection 
I thought was my duty 
Like I was a soldier 

I'd like to pay you but my funds are thin 
I'm so in move with my shirt 
But I'll throw it in 
Why can't you 
Understand what I'm going through 
It's a bad situation what can I do 

You know that 
On day and it won't be long 
We'll stand in this place undercover 
Licensed to be wrong 
One day and it won't be long 
We'll stand in this place 
And discover 

I'm not ashamed to tell you 
But you know it's over 
Naked is the beauty 
Crying on my shoulder 

It's hard to face rejection 
What use to be affection 
I thought was my duty 
Like I was a soldier 

One day and it won't be long
