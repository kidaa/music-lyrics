I'm always late 
But I caught you in time 
To escape from the scene of the crime 
Louder than cymbals 
All out or rhyme 
I give up 'cos I don't know the time 
I can't decide 
Won't let you rescue my pride 
Tell me the truth 
I have a picture of you 
You have a picture of me 

We could steal away in the night 
Or catch the earliest flight 
We've fallen in 
So let's swim 

You're out of my league 
But I'm depending on you 
You're all that I need 
So why don't you say it's true 
You're out of my league 

Like a picture hung on a wall 
Not a word to speak 
Lost for a cause 
You could give me so many things 
But without your love 
All of it stinks 

My only crime 
Is the state of my mind 
On loan to you 
I've got a picture of you 
You have a picture of me 

We could steal away in the night 
Or catch the very first flight 
We've fallen in 
So let's swim 

You're out of my league 
But I'm depending on you 
You're all that I need 
So why don't you say it's true 
You're out of my league
