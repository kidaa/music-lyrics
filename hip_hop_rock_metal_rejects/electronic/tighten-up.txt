It's never too late I heard you say 
How can you turn and go away 
I'm staking my claim to some degree 
Don't bring the secret home to me 
Better to live than to know 
Better the noise that we love than hate 
Remember the moments we've got 
Whenever I feel like I'm in a state 
There used to be a way but there ain't no more 
Tell me why because we need it 
I used to run away but I can't no more 
'Cause I feel that I can beat it 
There used to be a way but there ain't no more 

How can we be free? 
We both need each other like Sister and brother. 
You mean that much to me 
Better to live than to know 
Better the noise that we love than hate 
Remember the moments we've left 
Whenever I feel like I'm in a state 

I'm never gonna do what you want me to
