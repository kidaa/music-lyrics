You don't want me 
But I don't care 
I'm independent, when and there's no one there 
I'm not a substitute and it's wearing thin 
Why can't you see that I won't give in 
There's a rumor 
How can it be true 
The way that people talk 
It's as if they knew 
but if they only knew 
And thought I try 
I hope you understand 
If I'm alone with you 
It could get out of hand 

Please don't make me wait 
In front of you 
Love comes too late 
We're in a spin 
Confused within 
It must be fate 
Love comes too late 
Love comes too late 

I believe it was meant to be 
But when you threw me out 
I guess it made me see 
It could be a drag 
From my point of view 
But that's the kind of thing 
That I expect from you 

What can I do I'll never be the same 
Another day without you 
Would drive me insane 
It's a real life drama 
That I can't work out 
Don't think about it 
Let me take you out 

Please don't make me wait 
In front of you 
Love comes too late 
We're in a spin 
Confused within 
It must be fate 
Love comes too late 
Love comes too late
