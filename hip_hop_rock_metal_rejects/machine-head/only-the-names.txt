Welcome in my friend
Out of the cold where it's warm
Please step in
What's your name my friend
My name's the same
What a strange coincidence
Glad you're come to this place
What's the pleasure you chase
Oh, you like playing with speed
Well I have all the answers you need

I can take you
High and make you
Invincible
I'll never leave you

Welcome in my friend
Try some of this
What you'll feel is amazing
Tap a tiny blast
In a crease of foil
Place this flame beneath it
White smoke you will inhale
A speed rush you will exhale
The goose bumps prickle your skin
Just enough to dig the hooks in

I can take you
High and make you
Invincible
But now you're hollow

You're crawling on the floor
But you'll be back for more... yeah

Hello there my friend
Back for the sweet poison so soon again
But this lie must end
I must collect for those pleasures gave
When I first told you my name
I told you ours were the same
And that's not really a lie
My real name is your addiction

I will bring you
Down and break you
Burn right through you
Won't regret you
