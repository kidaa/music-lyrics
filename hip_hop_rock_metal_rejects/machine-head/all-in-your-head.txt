You tell me, I've been walking on a railing
Been excelling at failing
That I think wrong, I don't belong
I don't fit, I don't give a shit
Take my guitar and microphone, pour out my fuckin' soul
Insecurity, I'll strip it down to the bone - fuck it
I ain't a stranger, just strange
I'll be find so leave me alone

You can't see the things that make
Your happiness go away, well I can

It's all in your head
It's in your head
Sad but it's true
It's inside you
Keep wallowing in your misery
It's all in your head

I know that I'm a weirdo and I'm messed up
And the lord knows that I've fucked up
But I don't need you to point out
Every mistake that I make
I'm sick of all your negatives, something has gotta give
Got me thinking you need to stop overthinking
Brink of losing my mind and going blind
I'll be fine, leave me alone

You can't see the things that make
Your happiness go away, well I can

It's all in your head
It's in your head
Sad but it's true
It's inside you
Keep wallowing in your misery
It's all in your head

Why can't you see it's you
It's just inside of you

You can't see the things that make
Your happiness go away, well I can
Honestly you're driving me insane, again

Because it's all in your head
It's in your head
Sad but it's true
It's inside you
Someday you'll see who you're unhappy
Someday you'll see that it's not me
It's all in your head

It's just inside of you
