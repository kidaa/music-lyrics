And the story ends
insanity said coldly
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
by the call of the moon
was it really me
I saw in the mirror screaming
I swallowed hate and lies
through a thousand cries
someone's sucking out my energy

Bridge:
What can I do
on this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
at the edge of time

Ref.:
And the story ends
insanity said coldy
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
into insanity's claws

Come with me and join me
a new life's waiting for you
jump through the mirror
leave fear behind
no matter where I tried
the candle light seemed
lost forever
before my vision ends
 -cathedral
 -falling tears

We're not alone
there's someone else, too
from the mirror's other side
reflecting the cruel part of your soul
it's time for your choice

Bridge

Ref.:
And the story ends
insanity said coldy
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
by the call of the moon

Solo

Heart of dragon lies

Bridge

Ref.1st

I'm not a king
I'm just a bard
how can I trust
if there's good and bad
the wounds of life
they will remain
at least I found a friend
