In 1945 the year it came to be
Their fate decided
many miles accross the sea
They told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepaired.
Then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.

Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !

The men of power
had nothing to fear.
When the finger hits the switch
they're far away from here.
Down in their sanctuary
hidding in their lair.
The sorcerers of justice
will be waiting for them there.

Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !

I saw the people running
through all my dreams.
I heard the soldiers crying,
Mother Nature screams.
I saw destruction falling
from out of the sky.
I heard the Wise Man calling .... WHY
