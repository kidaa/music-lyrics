Taken the long way
Dark realms I went through
I arrived
My vision's so clear
In anger and pain
I left deep wounds behind
But I arrived
Truth might be changed by victory

Beyond the void but deep within me
A swamp of filth exists
A lake it was of crystal beauty
But Arda's spring went by
I've heard the warning
Well curse my name
I'll keep on laughing
No regret
No regret

chorus 1:
Don't fear the eyes of the dark lord
Morgoth I cried
All hope is gone but I swear revenge
Hear my oath
I will take part in your damned fate

I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow which covers the light
I will always remember the time
But it's past
I cannot turn back the time
I don't look back
There's still smoke near the shore
But I arrived
Revenge be mine

chorus 2:
I will take part in your damned fate
Morgoth I cried
It's my oath
So don't fear the eyes
Of the dark lord

Soon you will be free
Set your spirit free
 Suddenly I realized
The prophecies
I've never believed in
My deeds were wrong
I've stained the land
And slain my kin
Burning Soul
There's no release from my sins
It hurts
THE CURSE OF FANOR RUNS LONG
Time and only time will tell us
Tell: was I right or wrong
When anger breaks through
I'll leave mercy behind 

chorus 2

I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow they'll cover my life
But I'll also remember mine
And after all I'm still alive
