The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up
The king is in doubts
 Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him 
Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight
Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young fell in love

Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand

There's a moment in life
When all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears
We once shed
We recognize failures
The desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies

Wherever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last though
we'll depart in bitterness
one day you'll understand
Carry on, beloved maiden, mine
Cary on or we have to pay the price

Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand

Yesterday's memories
And melodies
Are gone with the wind so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one out in the emptiness
Where everything's pale
There is no sign of you
I'm alone
How I wish you should be here
I'm alone
Telling me it's alright
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
I'm alone and sadness
Reigns in my heart
As long as we live
It won't go away
We are one
But torn apart

Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand

Proudly it stands
Until the worlds end
The victorious banner of love
