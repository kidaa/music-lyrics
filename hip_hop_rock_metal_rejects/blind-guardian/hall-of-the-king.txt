Alone I walk, hearing a voice
that's calling my name
no one should be here
take no one with you
god, why I didn't care

On through death take me away
to the place time will not fade

Colder than dead
darkness - eternity
but look out

A hundred thousand centuries
the sun had never seen
so near but so much too far
eternal place you know what's life
but cannot tell

I can never see you changing
but you look to me
time will never heal your wounds
but you're immortal

Hall of the King a vision of the end
Hall of the King don't cry for us
don't hear us calling
Oh watch out for me Hall of the light
my last sign

You find yourself
just take a look
to see you must open your eyes
like a hawk in the sky
a wonder that dies
don't ask me wy

Lead: Andr

You're the birth and you're the end
you've been hurt but you're not dead
discovering you is what should never be
poisoned are our souls
and dark our hearts
ruins we've left to rule the world
destructive are our minds
it's much too late
