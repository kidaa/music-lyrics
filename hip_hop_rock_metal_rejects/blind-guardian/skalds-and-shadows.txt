Would you believe
In a night like this?
A night like this
When visions come true
Would you believe
In a tale like this?
A lay of bliss
We're praising the old lore
Come to the blazing fire and
See me in the Shadows
See me in the Shadows
Songs I will sing
Of runes and rings
Just hand me my harp
And this night
Turns into myth
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The World we live in
Is another skald's
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows
Do you believe
There is sense in it
Is it truth or myth?
They're one in my rhymes
Nobody knows
The meaning behind
The weaver's line
Well nobody else
But the Norns can
See through
The blazing fires of time and
All things will proceed as the
Child of the hallowed
Will speak to you now
See me in the Shadows
See me in the Shadows
Songs I will sing
Of tribes and kings
The carrion bird
And the hall of the slain
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The World we live in
Is another skald's
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows

Do not fear for my reason
There's nothing to hide
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie
Remember the runes
And remember the light
All I ever want
Is to be at you side
We gladden the raven
Now I will
Run through the blazing fires
That's my choice
Cause things
Shall proceed as foreseen
