Who can tell me who I am
who I am my friend
I'm an Alien so they say
a risk to everyone

NO - Tell me what do they see
NO - Tell me what do they feel
NO - Tell me what do they fear
NO - Tell me what do they see
I'm a dwarf but I know more than You
and I'm the key to a better life
from terror I could escape
but I need your helping hand
so far from home where I'm left alone
Did you hear my crying
Did you hear my crying

Ref.: Goodbye my friend
I found you at the end
I say Goodbye to all
Goodbye my friend
thanks for your helping hand
I say Goodbye to all my cries
just say Goodbye
lead: Andr

No returning nevermore
No returning nevermore
lead: Andr 

And I'll remember
Communication to you is so strange
you I trust to noone no warmths reach your heart
to you I'm the stranger but you're strange to me
You destruct all what is unknown to you
We are together now
and don't you know I'll come back again
I must go now

Ref.: Goodbye...
Solo: Andr 

I will go home now
I will go home now
much too long I'm forced to stay
in visions I see
so dark and so deep
mankind will destruct all life
See you again I hope I will
see you again at the end
My tortured soul cannot forget the pain
now I find my way back
I WILL GO HOME NOW
I WILL GO HOME NOW

Ref.: Goodbye...
