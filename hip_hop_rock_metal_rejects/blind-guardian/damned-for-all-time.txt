Conquer the whole world to satisfy
their lust for pain and terror
disguise their faces to hide them
in the dark
determination

The oath on the runestaff
is the highest
the ruin of a nation
step by step
destiny
Lead: Andr

Damned for all Time - but what's time 
Tales of the one who's born to change

And as the earth was old and cold
she closed her eyes and fell to sleep
violation ruled the world
the dark kingdom's time

He's called Hawkmoon wearing a sign
black jewel in his head
he's the one who's forever there
he's born a thousend times

Ref.:
Damned for all Time
in every age he existed
Damned for all Time
in every future he'll live
for all Time he's crying
he's crying

Hey strange one I know
you're standing there
the faces are they mine 
Are you out there 
Watch out for the day, fiend
I'll kmow your name
hear my laughter

Oblivion - who's blowing the horn
Oblivion - who's killing the gods

Ref.: Damned...

Solo: Andr

Dark kingdom's lost now
no pain storms the land
strange things are happening
changing of all planes
in the universe by a mad magican
to conquer the power of his magic
a place where truth waits must
be found Tanelorn
Lead: Andr

Damned for all Time - who am I 
Once I've been called Erekose

I was Elric - I'll be Corum
I'm the prince of the south ice
Now I'm nothing
wait for someone
wait for Ilian
No ! I'm Hawkmoon

Oblivion - the war is eternal
Oblivion - the battle is endless

Ref.: Damned...
