Close to insanity
beond the realms I've been
at darkest places
I'm crying
 The dragon flies 
lead: Andr

Something savage
is yearning for me
I'm waiting afraid for the night
what will be
I've lost myself
a few days ago
it's touching my soul
and a vision of past dreams comes true

Ref.: Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't You see the dragon's seed bears in me

the one who's been before
many times I terrorized this town
many times and here I start again
now I'm stronger and so cold
cold as ice
returning is my destiny
now I feel it's growing up in me
now I feel it's burning deep in me
I'm not what I was before
could I stop this dream
I'm a stranger to myself
and I cannot control

Ref.: Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Welcome to dying
The dragon's breath I don't let it out
solo: Andr

I'm a savage
it's too late for me
the other side's taking controll and I know
there's one way I can walk alone
or the dragon will fly
and a growing fear's all that I feel

Spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
