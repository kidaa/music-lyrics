There are signs on the Ring 
Which makes me feel so down 
There's one to enslave all Rings 
To find them all in time 
And drive them into darkness 
Forever they'll be bound 
Three for the Kings 
Of the elves high in light 
Nine to the mortal 
Which cry 

I'll keep the Ring full of sorrow 
I'll keep the Ring till I die 
I'll keep the Ring full of sorrow 
I'll keep the Ring till i die

Ref.: 

Slow down and I sail on the river 
Slow down and i walk to the hill 

And there's no way out 

Mordor 

Dark land under Sauron's spell 
Threatened for a long time 
Threatened for a long time 
Seven rings to the dwarves 
In their halls made of stone 
Into the valley 
I feel down 
One ring to the dark lord's hand 
Sitting on his throne 
In a land so dark 
Where i have to go 
I'll keep the Ring 5x 

solo: Marcus 

Slow down and I sail on the river 
Slow down and i walk to the hill 4x
