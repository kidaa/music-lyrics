There comes the last part and end of our old age 
With thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking 
The crown of the whole world 
His creatures will kill me poisons my soul 
To the end I will fight but I know that the things 
That I do are so meanless - oh, no ! 

I see the hill but it's so far away I know I can't reach it 
But I try it again and again in my dark dreams 
He's waysting my last will how long can I stay here 
When the mightiest of all will now 

Refrain: 
Run for the Night burn away 
The times of his fall I've to pay 

Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike 
Blooddlust their weapons and madness you see feel their 
Eyes there's no way out 
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control 
To the end I will fight but I know that the things 
That I do are so meanless - oh, no

I see the hill but it's so far away I know I can't reach it 
But try it again and again in my dark dreams 
He's waysting my last will how long can I stay here 
When the mightiest of all will now 

Refrain: 
Run for the Night burn away 
The times of his fall I've to pay 

You see them running in the shadows of the night 
It is not what it used to be 
They've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight 
You see them running with the wind 

They 
Run for the night 
Run for the night 
Run for the night 

Solo

Refrain: 
Run for the Night far away 
The times of his fall I've to pay 
Run for the Night far away 
The times of his fall I've to pay
