I came from far
Beyond Your reality
The ocean of time
It's the odysee of mine
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell You 
Where I've been
And what I saw
And how it ends

Welcome to the wasteland
In a world which is turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while
It's turning faster
Away from light straight to the dark
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
And then the march of time begins

The man in black he waits
Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine
They try to stop me
The battle it has begun

So I'm not afraid
To walk down to the wasteland
I'm so alone on my way
And I don't fear that dusty godforsaken path
Somewhere far beyond

Ref.:
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins

Look at my soul
And behind
There are some things
I've to hide from You 
I'm following the black man
I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy

Welcome to the new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins

The prisoner did bring the healing spell
The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all

What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell You 
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends

Solo

Ref. 2x

Look around and see
The world is turning fast
Faster day by day
Somewhere far beyond
I'll try to change it
If I can - Somewhere far beyond
There's only one chance
And it lies - Somewhere far beyond
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
The march of time it has begun
