Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you.
Who is that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The stumps of time
Oh turn the wheel and heal me
Since moonlight fade
I'm empty - heal me

I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out

Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away

"Tic Tac" is the message.
And the lunatic fears
He is no more

Speak to me
It all would be easier
While I'm passing by
Who's that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The ghosts arrive.

Pick up my bones and
Tell me
Is this the "Lake of Fire"?
Hell?
Please

I'm in search of the Lionheart
Nobody else
But the pure can save me.
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out.

Ruins rule my memories
I can't recall the signs
Invite the dead
Then silence struck my mind

Silence is madness
"Tic Tac Tic Tactic"
Says the clock

Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Hear me

Welcome to the sad place
And hand me what is mine
I'm the Theban prophet
The dead and blind

And from sea you'll feel me
Then you'll breath out gently
Leave me

I'm in search of the Lionheart...
