Run 'til you find the answer
Time out for our poor Cassandra
She's fairy safe inside the fire

Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired

They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind

Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Remember the oath

Wake up it's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played

Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone

And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste

King of terror
Just stop wining
Hold your breath
It won't take long realize
This is your judgement day

In between the killing carry on

There are no rules here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Try to understand

You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
For our sake

We're not allowed to see
Beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson
 We can't fly with broken wings 
Break the chains
Time to change

I'm afraid to say
But you won't play a part
It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way

Don't mind the blood here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Try to understand
Under the ice you will be free
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
And no more gods
I'm afraid to say
But you won't play a part
