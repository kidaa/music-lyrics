Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns

Deceit

Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies

[bridge:]
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord

[chorus repeat 2x:]
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill

I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you

He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries

Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned

[bridge]

[chorus]

The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king

Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain

[bridge]

[chorus]

The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and fa lls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king
Praise our king
Praise our king
Praise our king
