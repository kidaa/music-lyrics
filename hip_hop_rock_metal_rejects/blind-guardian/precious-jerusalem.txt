No doubt doubt
No longer need to hide it
I've found out who I am
I' moved around  in circles
I rise and fall again
I know it well
Every word I tell
Seems to make no sense at all

Words will heal it
Love will conquer
The hearts of the hopeless
The almighty is still alive

Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up for Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Building up old Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up for Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Building up old Jerusalem

I've gone beyond
But there's no life
And there is nothing how it seems
I've gone beyond
But there's no life
There is no healing rain in Eden
The empty barren wasted paradise

Let's celebrate the dawning of the son

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can change fate

Son of man
You truly are mine

Can't stand the pain
No more grief and misery
It goes on and on and on and on
and on and on and on

Father stop it now
We must stop it now

You really think you are half way up
I would not mind if you were right
It's not sure
I'd rather say you are half way down
So I am going to help you
If I can

I've been caught
In wilderness
In wilderness
I've got out well
I found myself
In desert lands
In desert lands
But you've been on my mind

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can change truth

Rise up and follow me
'Cause I will bring the light
Rise up and follow me
Wake up and clear your mind
I try to bring it back
The seed of life
I try to bring it back
The seal of light

So if you say
There's no faith in man
You better keep in mind
That I can read between the lines
My heavy burden brings
Eyesight to the blind

I've been caught
In wilderness
In wilderness
I've got out well
I found myself
In desert lands
In desert lands
But you've been on my mind

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can change me
