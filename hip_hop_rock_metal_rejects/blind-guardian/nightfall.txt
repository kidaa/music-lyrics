No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
 All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone 

 Save me your speeches
I know They blinded us all
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore 

Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
 We're lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown 
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain

chorus:
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony

 How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be 
But even in silence I heard the words
 An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken 

Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside

The doom of the Noldor drew near

The words of a banished king
 I swear revenge 
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge

chorus

 Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
But freely you came and
You freely shall depart
So never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends 

 Oh I'm heir of the high lord! 
 You better don't trust him 
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said

chorus

Back to where it all began
