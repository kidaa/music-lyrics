I cannot say that I don't care
'Cause I'm aware of everyone and everything
They're everywhere

Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
Spinning around
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain
Your brain

The cautious hare
Cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
He constantly knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on

Silent creature
Filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease
A release
A vanished
Kingdom falls
It goes on
On and on
And again
It goes on

Round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head

Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
Oh I wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation
We're the chosen ones
We're the last descendants
We're a tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels

Well the time is right
You shall be on my side

I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen

There is not the slightest
Doubt it all
Not at all

In lower airs
We're ground down
By their ignorance

Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer

Round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head

Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
Oh I wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
Spinning around
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no

The hopeful he sadly admits
There's no hero no place to hide
There is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know
Bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
Oh I wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

It's you who has said
There's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within
It's in your mind
