At Hilly's show
they didn't know
that the Ending of  Being  is near
I can feel their voices
the old man cries
 Please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home 
Monster Anne is crying out
 Feel my pain I can't escape 
Bad chances for me

Ref.: Altair 4 3x

chosen by their whispering words
What is left behind
When purple colours turn to black
Can you feel it
Is there time
Can you see it
Is there life
 Fly away and dream
