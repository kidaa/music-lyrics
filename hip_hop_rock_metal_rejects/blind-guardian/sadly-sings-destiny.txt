A wooden cup
And a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore
That someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before
The Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me
Shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice
To crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
 For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in 
Repeat

I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
The king's in town
We need a crown
I think we all know
How it ends

So we're not going take it longer
So all I know is I don't care
Sp we're not going take it longer
Now we are aware

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice
To crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
 For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in 
Repeat

There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance
I hear the voices say
 We get him home tonight
And that's all you need to know 
I'm alone

So I can't stand it any longer
And I don't want to see it all
Nazarene your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice
To crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
 For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in 
Repeat
