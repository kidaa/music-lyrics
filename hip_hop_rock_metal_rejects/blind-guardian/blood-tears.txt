Welcome to my realm
We are both condemned to live
It's a dark fate
I can hear your calls
I can hear your calls
THE ETERNAL LIFE

I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain

Alive
Though the end appears my friend

chorus:
And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand

My mind's
In frozen dreams
The rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
Noone leaves and noone ever will

Can't hold it
It burns
Each night I cry in pain

chorus:
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside

It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
In blame

And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain

chorus:
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
Cut off your old friends hand
