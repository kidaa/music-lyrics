I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye

chorus:
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom

I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call

chorus:
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of the doom

High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home

I say farewell

chorus:
To the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
