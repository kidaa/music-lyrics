He was born in the past time 
To take all our pain 
The kingdom of heaven is near 

The children of this time 
Must die for his arrive 
To let all the legends be true 

The prophecy said they'll call king of the jews 
He is born now to take all our sins 
Three kings were searching for this holy child 
The journey begins, he has to die 

Lead: Andre 

Bridge: 
Healing the cripples and taking our pain 
He came for the sinner 
But what we have paid 
Disciples are following 
They are calling his words 
Salt of the earth and light of the world 

Refrain: 
Martyr - we are following you bless us for eternity 
Messiah - we are torturing you when you lose the power of your words 

Jump from the temple and angel will save 
Show me that you are the son of our God 
Now take my land with my power you get 
Rulin' the world of tomorrow 
Now !

Lead: Andre 

Messiah - Liar - Our burning desire 
He is the king without a crown 
We will set him to his throne 
Give me 30 p. of silver and I'll be your man 

Higher - Liar - The fallen Messiah 
Let us see his agony 
The things he done are blasphemy 
Mob has lost their joy on toy so let us kill him fast 

Now drink my blood for the new testament 
This is my body you eat 
One of you twelve is the one who betrays 
Better that he's never born 

Judas you're the chosen one 
The world has damned your name 
No !

Lead: Andre 

Bridge:
Begin with a kiss at a cross it will end 
The kingdom of heaven we've passed 
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall 
The father is crying for his son 
The tortured Messiah is finding his way 
The journey has come to the end 
The twelve ones are preaching the words he had left 
They're changing the way of the world but die for 

Solo: Marcus

Refrain: 
Martyr - we are following you bless us for eternity 
Messiah - we are torturing you when you lose the power of your words 
Martyr - we are following you bless us for eternity 
No
