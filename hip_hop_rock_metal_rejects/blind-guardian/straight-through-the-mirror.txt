Can you tell me
Is there any other way?
I cannot hide it
I have doubts
I'm not afraid to stay
I'm here
When the curtain falls.

Once I've touched the rainbow,
The man on the moon will appear.
I won't show fear

I turn to you, father death
I'm begging you
Please
Consider
You may have been wrong

Just close your eyes now
Just close your eyes now

The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air
There's magic everywhere
Just be aware
Wake up when the crow will call

There is no truth
There are no rules,
There's no plot here
It's twisted
We're still on course
My friend
Down to the abyss - Orcus lane
Shelter of your memories
Shelter of your pain

The mirror shows truth
Reveals what you are
A phoenix in flames
Arise from the ashes again
We're on our way now
We're on our way now

The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air

I feel
There is something wrong.
It's twisting and turning
When everything's burning
Awake
It's not safe

And I'm coming down to you again
We'll sail our miracles and then
If you don't mind
I'll sing a song
A song of lullaby this time

When you're asleep
I'm back again
The world of miracles in hand
If you don't mind
I'll sing a song
A sort of lullaby this time
We're on our way now
We're on our way now

The end's a miracle...

Wake up when the crow will call
