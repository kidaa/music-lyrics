It's dark
Let's do it now
Bring in the sirens
Cut of their tongues
Do it now
Ignore their cries
Ignore their cries
Now close the door
And leave it
Nothing went wrong
The Archangel is falling
Mourners split
Take heart of grace
A ghostly candle light
Lit my room at night
Son of man
We're breeding wastelands
Wastelands

The blood of Sirens
On my hands
I can't wash away
Still it pours
And stains our land
In bitterness
So cruel
Will ages go by
Dead sound of misery
Come share our sorrows
Be one with the Hydra

It's drown or burn
I'm exploring bedlam
The time is right to move
Furthermore
Bring out the dead
Turn your back
On the ones you have loved
Enjoy the heat of your whore
Babylon
Hear what the spirits says
There is no sense at all
So many times I have failed
Pure desperation
Still hear the cries
Of voices
Long gone by
They've gone abroad
And left this world behind
Leave me behind
Behind the walls I'm crying

The blood of Sirens...

So many times I have failed
Pure desperation
Still hear the cries
Of voices
Long gone by
They've gone abroad
And left this world behind
Leave me behind
Behind the walls I'm crying

The blood of Sirens...
