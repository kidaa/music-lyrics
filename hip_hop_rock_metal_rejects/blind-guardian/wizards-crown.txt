Years ago I came back 
This has been my hardest attack 
A burning fire's in my brain 
I could feel the deadly flame 

Tales of the magic in my head 
To a dark dream I fall in my mind 
I hold the key of fortune 

To feel the strange thing's in my mind 
The stone of Amber I must find 
I'll take the chance that day 

Refrain: 
Halloween - The wizard's crown I'll take - on 
Halloween 
Halloween - But there is no return - on 
Halloween 

Lead: Andre 

I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the realms of death 
The gate is open wide you cannot close 

His dungeons deep no place to hide 
The times have changed he has to fight 
In magic spell I fall 

Illusions falling to my mind 
But where's the key I cannot find 
The ritual has begun 

Refrain: 
Halloween - The wizard's crown I'll take - on 
Halloween 
Halloween - But there is no return - on 
Halloween 

Solo: Andre 

The battle has begun 
The warlock's time has come 
I pay the price I have to pay 

Why haven't see the signs 
I'm loosing now my life 
But cannot die forever life 

Refrain: 
Halloween - The wizard's crown I'll take - on 
Halloween 
Halloween - But there is no return - on 
Halloween 
Halloween - The wizard's crown I'll take - on
