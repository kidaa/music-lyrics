Hallowed be the fatherland
god he knows
how long I'd been away
from here I did start for a search so
full of decease
I still hear my cryouts
from the old cellar's inside

Born in the days of medieval
my inner voice
is alway asking why

I came from nowhere
without a task, without a name
no fear of evil
fate, so god please lead me through
forgotten realms
mysterious dreams
in sunless rooms I'd sworn
I'll finish what I started, once
I'll find my holy grail
in the holy land

Ref.:
Returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
the jester's tears
they are inside me
agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
is the script already written
jester's tears I cry
yes, I cry

I went out of my mind
in desert lands
insanity's pawn
out of control
much too long I've been isolated
from my thoughts
enclosed by the leader's spell
bewildered to marc
as a glory knight
and I tried

Still I hear the scream of thousands:
 Crucify, crucify
Take it all
our gold, our home, our life,
but we didn't kill your Christ!!
Reach out for your holy grail
enslave us and make us
your god's sacrifice!! 

Ref.

Solo

Still I'm confused
if I was dreaming
too late I realized
I'd been another fool
I pay the price

Returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
the jester's tears
they are inside me
agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
is the script already written
jester's tears I cry
