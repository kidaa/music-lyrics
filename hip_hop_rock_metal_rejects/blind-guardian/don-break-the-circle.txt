Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle

Concentrate!
I'm your contact link across the great divide
Many voices in my ear
Hold on I think there's something coming through
From the other side. It's for all those who believe
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest

Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle

Unexplained
Many things we thought were lost may come to light
On a higher plain in the spirit world
Where only a few of us possess the second sight
Now the messenger awaits
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest

Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle.The circle must keep going on and on

But wait
Is there one amongst us here who believes
A stranger to the sign
Take care, for all the things you fear
May be revealed
Within the forces of the night
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest

Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
The circle must keep going on and on
The circle must keep going on and on
