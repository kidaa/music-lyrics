Taste the poison
Feel that this is life
Hallowed be the game
Of life and innocence
God's waiting for him
Join us at the road to fate
There are no two paths
Feel the pain
Which steps into his life

Agony
He'll be crucified
Death awaits
Knocking at his door
Agony
Leave him
The clock will strike the end
Hell or heaven
Reflect and fade away

Ref.:
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and You obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes You will obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
the life clock strikes and You obey
A light shows the right way

Morning is whispering in my head
Too late to say goodbye
Too late
The last breath's done
Deliverance at all
he's born to find this end
I am the one
The one who's calling
Obey my call to the cemetary
And don't be afraid
To step into the dark
Be sure that my voice
will take You home

Ref.:
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and You obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes You will obey
Time isn't here to stay

Solo

No hope he'd waited so long
This can't be God's will
He surrendered long ago
There was no real chance

Ashes to ashes and dust will be dust
Ashes to ashes, you all will be dust again

The clock had struck the end
Up to heaven
Reflexions fade away

Ref. 1st

Taste the poison
Feel that this is life
Hallowed be the game
