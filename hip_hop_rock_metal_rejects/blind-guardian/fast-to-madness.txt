White hair and red eyes
he's holding the crown
the king of the island
Elric of Melnibon
he's born for destruction
he's ruled by the gods
eternal hero
the scale of the universe

Blood on his hands
he's born a thousand times
why don't we feel the signs
from the dragon king
Lead: Andr

Before the end of fire his journey starts
the eagle's spreading his wings
following his fate
he's ruled from anywhere
leads him to the truth
it's deep inside

Hail to the king
they'll bless tonight
he's the Saviour of our time

In a dark land far behind
no one knows it's name
there's a dark sword cold as ice
a blade created for him

Stormbringer cries
for the soul of everyone
Stormbringer crues
 The ending has begun 

Ref.:
Run fast to Madness
Forever I
Run fast to Madness
Leave him alone
Solo: Andr

Ref.: Run...

Destiny's calling him back to the island
And time time is standing still
time is not real
time is not real

Armed with weapons awaiting the fight
he's leading the dragon
the sun will never rise
creatures are lurking
in darkness they hide
high in the sky the dragon king is flying
Lead: Andr

Hail to the king of Melnibon
he's the Saviour of our time

Mourning deserts rottingness
blade of dark will rise
gods devine
are hiding in the dark
needing Elric's hand

Stormbringer cries:
 I'm forged in darkest time 
Stormbringer cries:
 The ending has begun 

Ref.: Run...
