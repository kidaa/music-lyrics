By the ruins he stands
And he's waiting for me
To enter Tanelorn
His paths seems strange
But they're always planned
Seldom he succeeds
About his own fate

He tries to conquer it
Again and again
But at last he's almost
A ruined man
Not a king or God
Who's searching for
A place called Tanelorn
Far beyond your dreams

Ref.:
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn

He's waiting 
He's waiting for me
He's waiting
He's waiting for me

[Spiritus sanctus - vita aeterna]

Darkness falling down on me
Darkness - The eternal battle rises

I know the answers
Although they don't exist
I'm just a mortal illusion

Ref.

Solo

So I'm his companion
Through space and through time
His eternal servant
He's calling me 
So I must leave
To any life
To another world
Far beyond Your dreams

To know the truth
Just for a while
He's longing for a place
Where he can find himself
Deliverance
It could be everywhere
How can he find
He's waiting for me
And for Your Tanelorn

Ref.:
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We're left alone
