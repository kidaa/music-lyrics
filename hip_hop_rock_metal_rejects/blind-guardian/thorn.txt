A black swan
Is born that night
The misty pond
Has got a new king
Got a new king
So what can we do
With our lives
When it all begins
It's hard and
It's cruel
Will grace die in pain
Will light ever rise again

I'm trapped in darkness
Still I reach out for the stars
I'm moving in silence
I leave it all far behind

chorus:
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns

Let us march on
To the fields of sacrifice
I'm wondering why
I'll carry on
Will I betray myself
To rise

In the silence
It's time to explain
And
Search for truth in lies
Useful lies
Needless love's damned

What can we do with our lives
When it all begins

chorus

Come follow me
And you will see
How it will be
When all the pain is gone away

chorus

Let us march on
Though there's no hope at our side
Let us be brave
Though by glory we are denied
But
Don't you think
It's time for us
To bring to an end
Come play the song of death
The wisdom in us both
Will make it
Special guaranteed
Play the song of death

I'm lost in the depths of his eyes
I can't flee
Inner pain caused insanity
It's deep within
The fear and the hunger
Enslaved and denied
By my love and my enemies
I'm the illgotten son

chorus
