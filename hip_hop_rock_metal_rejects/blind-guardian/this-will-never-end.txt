Once upon a time
No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end

I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony,
There are no rules
But only one

There's someone young sister,
Caught in the border
Let's get in contact
He's either yours or mine

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now

Far out in space
I ride on
Time is chasing us all
It's not quite how it seems
It's just a dream

I don't believe
In a soul out of god
It's just twisted
Further
You do not understand:

Each single breath inspires you
Come to an end - expire.

Rise up my sister
Let's cross the border
Reveal the secret
One more soul to burn

I have thought...

You finally have approached
Still
There's something left to do:
Draw near and prove
Your souls not ripe, yet!
Prepare yourself then wait for me
Expect the day when I come by
You're released now
For a while you may feel
Resurrection
Open your eyes

The vision's bleak
And its color is black,
Far beyond
There's a starving
But dying sun.

I have thought...
