There are signs on the ring
which make me feel so down
there's one to enslave all rings
to find them all in time
and drive them into darkness
forever they'll be bound
Three for the Kings
of the elves high in light
nine to the mortal
which cry
solo: Marcus

Ref.: Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow dawn and I walk to the hill

and there's now way out
Mordor
dark land under Sauron's spell
threatened a long time
threatened a long time
Seven rings to the gnoms
in their halls made of stone
into the valley
I feel down
One ring for the dark lord's hand
sitting on his throne
in the land so dark
where I've to go
solo: Marcus

Ref.: Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Lord of the rings
