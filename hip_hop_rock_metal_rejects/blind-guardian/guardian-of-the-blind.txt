Extermination thunder the strange one is back again 
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever 
Fall into a dark dream that we got once 
The part it's real you won't believe 

Lead: Andre 

We're watching our own agony many years ago 
Seven little children stand against the ghost 
Believing is the answer but you've lost before 
Find back to your infancy it's time to die 

Lead: Andre/Thomas 

I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep 
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright 
Killing for the thirst for small children sweat 
I give them illusions to raise their fear 

Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears 
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright 
But there's a new feeling I've never known 
There must be a third one a mighty guardian 

Refrain: 
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind 
Now it feel the curse of heaven 
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind 
Now it feel the curse of the child 

Solo: Andre

Dark is it's world and lonely we're reaching it again 
Fear our returning visions to madness we will fall 
If we can't kill the beast forever we must die now 
One has blown his life away 

Lead: Andre

Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand 
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain 
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again 
We will find the answer it's time to die 

Solo: Marcus

By a ritual we have hurt it but we have not kill 
Little Billy you must find your way, no 
Believe in you we ask for but where we can never find 
There must be a sign for the Guardian of the Blind 

Refrain: 
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind 
Now it feel the curse of heaven 
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind 
Now it feel the curse 

Lead Licks: Andre

Come to it's world following the sign 
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind 
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign 
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
