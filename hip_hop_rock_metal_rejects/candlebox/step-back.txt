How can you say we're not together?
How can you say it's all the same in someone else's eyes?
How can you say it gives you pleasure?
That someone's pulling you aside
But now I want to find out
How you're living outside yourself
And how you feel like the one that's held it all in place
How you don't feel the shame
You'll never know, you'll never know now
How to let go the hate or how to hold on
You'll never know, never know now now
Where it all can lead to
Leave it all in the past and move on
You might find your way home
Leave it all in the past and roll on
You might find your way home
How can you stray from your direction?
How can you wait outside the door that's opened up for you?
How can you only see rejection,
When I've offered all I have to you?
Are you ever gonna find out
you'll never know, never know now now
Where it can all lead to
Leave it all in the past and move on
You might find your way home
Leave it all in the past and roll on
You might find your way home
Step back
Take a closer look
Step back
Find out where it leads you to
Step back Step back Step back
Leave it all in the past and move on
You might find your way home
Leave it all in the past and roll on
You might find your way home
Leave it all in the past and move on
You might find your way home
Leave it all in the past and roll on
You might find your way home
