Did I feel this way back then?
Did you wake up to the sound of pouring rain?
Fading days of blue rush past your eyes
Would you lose yourself in someone else's vain?
Or should you shout your mind out when the loss began?
High until you washed away
It's all the same
I realized it through this song
I sing out loud and call your name
Do you feel I'm only someone you could never ever know?
In it all you'll find, you see you're not that far from me 
So walk and hold your head up high
A stone's throw away
I feel right now like I felt way back then
The center of my life I lost it all
Never ever knew how much I'd loved until you left, you're gone
Fell right now like I was chasing you the same way 
High until you washed away
It's all the same
I realized it through this song
Sing out loud and call your name
Do you feel the only someone you could never ever know? 
In it all you find, you see you're not that far from me 
To walk and hold your head up high
A stone's throw away
I would like this stone to roll
High until i washed it all away
It's all the same
I realized it through this song
Sing out loud and call my name
Do you feel the only someone you could never ever know
In it all you find
You see you're not that far from me to walk and hold your head up high
A stone's throw away
You're just a stone's throw away
Never knew how much I'd loved until you're gone
Never knew how much I'd love 
Until you're gone away
Feel right now like I felt way back then
The center of my life I lost it, lost it all
Never knew how much I'd loved until you're gone
Never knew how much I'd loved until you're gone away
A stone's throw away
