I never know
I never care
I never believe my people
I'll tell you what I say
I never lie
I never try
I never cry for you people
I'll push you
Push away
But you lonely people 
Keep on running around my door
Yes you lonely people
Keep on begging
Beg for more
And I'll for you
Yes I'll die for you
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll tell you now how I fell inside
Feel in my heart it's for you
I'll never true
I'll never die
I'll never push for you people
I'll tell you how I fell
I'll never lie
I'll never cry
I'll never true for you people
It'll you, yes it's real
And you lonely poeple
Keep on passing time away
Yes you lonely people keep on passin,
Pass away
And I'll cry for you
Yes I'll die for you
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll tell you now how I feel inside
Feel in my heart it's for you
And I'll take everything
As it comes my way
Pushin' your pain around my door
Will I cry for you as I die for you
Is this blood on my hands all for you
But you shiver 
You shudder 
Recovers your mother
You feel it take control
Come around town
Steal another dime
Take another line
Won't you feel it
Blanket your soul
You're out of mind
Come around town 
Steal another dime
Do another crime
Won't you get it higher & higher
Roll through time 
Come around town
Steal another dime
Don't you push your drugs in my face
Yest, I'm feeling fine
Feelin' fine
Don't you push drugs in my face
Or I'm gonna put you in your place
Fuck you
I don't want it no more
And it's mine on my own
Yes it's mine all alone
As I cry for you
Yes I'll die for you
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll take everything
As it comes my way
Feel in my heart it's for you
And I'll lie for you as I die for you 
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll tell you now
How I feel inside
Fuck you
