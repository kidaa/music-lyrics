As I stand here I ponder greater things
No longer a part of
A part of your lover's dreams
So much for your 
Common complications
So much for your 
Constant desperation
For what's to come
It's all been written
Down, written down
But I feel that a change is
A change is gonna come
I feel so alive now
And I feel that a change is
A change is gonna come
As I sit here I'll tell you greater things
No longer a part of
A part of someone else's dreams
So much for your
Common escalations
So much for your 
Constant fabrications
For what's to come 
It's all been written down, down, down
I said for what's to come
For what's to come your way
It's all been written
Down, written down
But I feel that a change is
A change is gonna come I said
I feel so alive now
And I feel that a change is
A change is gonna come 
Keep on time
Keep on time
You run along
Keep on child
Keep on child
You move along
Keep on my time now
I run around for you
Keep on time 
Keep on time
You run along
Keep on child
Keep on child
You push it on
Keep on my time now
I run around for you
You don't know yet 
You don't know yet
You don't know yet
But you'll feel it in your soul
You don't know yet
But you feel it in your soul
As I lay here I wanna fall asleep
No longer
No longer a part of your TV screen
A part of your TV dream
I said so much for your
So much for your common complications
So much for your 
So much for your constant desperation
For what's to come it's all been written
Down, written down
But I feel that a change is
A change is gonna come I said 
I feel so alive now
And I feel that a change is
A change is gonna come
