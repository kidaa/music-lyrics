I wipe the night from my eyes
Block out the sunny day and I hide
Everything's falling down around us
I'm just missing the rain
I'm happier now today 
Don't let me down
Don't let me go
A change of seasons inside her mind
In time I'll decide 
In time I'll decide to move on
We change directions, we watch the tides
And we borrow too much
We form restrictions and we form lines
And we separate you from me
Sometimes, sometimes we carry more weight than we own
Oh but sometimes sometimes goes on
Night takes the light by the hand
Tunes out the boring day and cries out loud
Everyone's hanging on, hanging on my words
It kills the thrill in being divine
But she's happier now today 
Don't let her down 
Don't let her go
There are no reasons there are no lies
We just bleed together
That's how we realize
We change directions we watch the tides
And we borrow too much
We From restrictions and we form lines
We separate you from me
Sometimes sometimes we carry more weight than we own
Oh but sometimes sometimes goes on
Somehow we'll find a way we've got to paste it back together
These ripped out pages of old coloring books where your
Gold is silver, my blue is gray
Its all held together by cellophane tape 
but We change directions, we watch the tides
And we borrow too much
We form restrictions and we form lines
We separate you from me
Sometimes sometimes we carry more weight than we own
Oh but sometimes sometimes goes on 
In my head I've got everything I want in you
