Simple, simple lessons, simple...
Sound to be where, make you want to scream.
Always left without, saying hello.
I've seen chains the bear less, snap and fall long before you let go.
Times run over your sink onto my floor,
It's okay, we've cleaned them many times before.
Simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple...
Sounds might be where, yeah I want to cry
Always left before, I said hello.
He's had days where shades of brilliance, never granted him space.
Green shades of painful rains, it's okay, they'll wash away now
Simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple...
Always taught you how, drain yourself empty.
Always taught you how, drain yourself empty.
We're all scarred up from ages of childish games.
Yet I've never seen your head up higher.
It feels real this time, I see you happy again.
Reel it in for awhile, oh enough to take my
Ain't enough to take my ain't enough to take my, ain't enough to take my, ain't enough to take my place
Sounds might be where, you want to scream.
Always left without, saying hello.
I've seen chains that bear less, snap and fall long before you,
Long before you let go
