At a stand still, somebody, somebody put me here.
As I heal you, it's not that much difference, we'll be there.
Can't you all see, what it says?
It's says okay now, okay now, now you go.
And I think I, I'll make it,
Because I love you, I love yes you know.
It's amazing, that we're still here.
It's amazing, how?
I know you fear me now,
Why did you leave it in my hands?
I can't explain,
How can you leave me out,
How can you push me out,
How can you push me around again?
It's amazing, that we're still here.
It's amazing, how?
Oh, amazing that we're still here
It's amazing.
it's amazing, that's we're still here.
It's amazing, how?
It's amazing that we're still here.
Turn it into my direction,
Why did you leave it, leave it in my hands?
How can you put down, how can you put me out,
How can you push me around, push me around, amazing...
It's amazing...
life, it gives, what you were living, and there's something telling me that i need to go...
