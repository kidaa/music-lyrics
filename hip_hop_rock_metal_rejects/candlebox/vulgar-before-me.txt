To you.  Seperation, only to put it down.
To you.  Desperation, only to be around.
So on and so under, misdirected in other words.
Always I wonder is there anything I can do for you?
Anything I can do?  Well I can do anything...
To some, I've been singled out, always I take your fall.
To some, same and broken down,
All we've left is dropping around you.
And you know these lines they're open ended.
These books were meant to be followed,
And your rules left to be read...
Is there anything I can do?
I can do anything.  I can do anything,
It's vulgar before me...
Is there anything I can do?
I can do anything.  I can do anything.
It's vulgar before me, vulgar before me...
Vulgar before me, vulgar before me.  
Vulgar, vulgar before me.
Anything I can do?
I can do anything.  I can do anything.  
Vulgar before me, vulgar before me...
