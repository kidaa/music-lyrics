Ill get so close to you
Ill let you down my friend
You see it in this face
And hear it in these words
And I begin to know, and I begin to feel, 
Everything Ive wanted
And I become a man through you
You find out my needs, this separation,
Push away everything and anyone connected,
To you needs and to your life and to your ties
Ill push it all away,
I said its all right there for you now
Hey I said its all right there for you to tell
Ill let you down my friend, Ill turn my back to you
I never meant to leave you, never meant to leave your room
You began alone, and youve begun again, all I wanted for you
I become alive through you,
Can you feel this constant resurrection of needs,
Im sorry for those things I meant to help you, and I meant to fill you,
And Ill always let you down,
And Ill always put you out,
Ill push it all away,
I said its all right here for you now
Hey I said its all right there for you to tell
Thought to feel it in your life
Thought to take your time to grow
I was sent to be here, left to hurt you, 
This time its sad, youve gone
Hey I said its all right there for you now
Hey I said its all right there for you too
Hey I said its all right there for you now
Thought to feel it in your life
Thought to take your time to grow
