Offerings...
Look what you're offering
By your hands, you've emptied my soul
But I'll find some time 
I'll find somewhere to grow
Look out now
Has your mind been changed by the loss of this memory?
Roll on
You've got some time on your hands for where you are now
Bleeding the offerings
Yes you are now
Bleeding the offerings
My time to sit you all down
My time to save you all now
My time to lay it all out
My time
See what you're offering
See I open my eyes
Your face seems to speak aloud
Seeing it all in my eyes
I see some things in your eyes that have never been shown before
Roll on
Believing it all in my eyes
You've got these needs but I've got somewhere to go now now
So leave it alone, it's my time
With so little time it's so hard to find somewhere to go
Bleeding the offerings
Yes you are now
Bleeding the offerings
My time to sit you all down
My time to save you all now
My time to lay it all out
My time to save your souls again
My time to sit you all down now
My time to save you all now
My time to lay it all out
My time
