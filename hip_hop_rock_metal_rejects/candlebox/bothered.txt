Take everything I want to,
Break down everytime I'm told to,
You steal every line I cling to,
And find out ever lie I've told you.
And so you want to help me,
Rushing in my state,
So you wanna help me.
And losing all my time.
So you wanna know me.
I step aside my hate,
Who said you ever told me?
You lie, you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, yeah.
A puppet in my hand I'll hold you,
Strung out on the lines I sold you,
And boterhed by the time I reach you,
Stepped in, by time, I fall.
And still you want to mold me,
Rushing in my state,
So you wanna mold me.
And losing all my time.
So you wanna know me.
I step aside my hate,
Who said you ever told me?
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, yeah.
You lie yeah.
So you wanna know me,
You lie yeah.
So you wanna mold me,
You lie, 
Who said you ever told me?
You lie...
