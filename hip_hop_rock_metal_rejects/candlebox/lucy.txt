Anoher lie for us to live in.
Pages pick it up anytime she likes.
Another life for her to put down, pick it up, pick it up.
Anytime she might find enough to, enought to get her high.
And I'll get her high
Turn it off, I found her weakness
Bones filled with memories shavings.
Lead into something better,
I heard it yesterday.
Old news my friend,
She's broken hearted...
I know, she'd seen it all along,
She's better off lately.
They said it's all she's after,
Everytime, Everytime, yeah
Can she free it,
Has it all been wasted.
Can we see her one last time?
Another lie for her to live in.
Breakdowns, pull her out and knock us down everytime.
Another time for her to find out,
She'll let it go blue,
And then she'll fall down. Gently,
Until she's broken hearted...
I know, she's seen it all along,
She's better off lately.
They said it's all she's after,
Everytime, Everytime, yeah.
Can she free it,
Has it all been wasted.
Can she free it one last time?
Can she free it?
see her one last time...
So when she lays her head down,
Do you read all the thought that she feeds aloud
She can, she can see through
And when she says she found out,
All the things that she thought we could read about,
She can, she can see through.
When she said she played out,
All the dreams that she thought she could dream about,
Do you feel, do you feel, do you feel,
Do you feel the need to break free?
You don't need to take me...
Lay her down, lay it.
Lucy, lucy, lucy, lucy, lucy...
