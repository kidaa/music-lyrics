Some will find subtlety left in strangers,
Some will find subtlety alone.
And if you find everything like you're looking for,
If you find anything let me in.
My eyes, I see, I see everything.
My eyes, I see it's together I know.
Some will find everything trapped in cages.
Some will find simple things inside their zoo.
And if you find everything like you're looking for,
If you find anything let me go.
My eyes, I see, I see it all.
My eyes, I see and feel it's together I know.
Butterfly home, fly home, fly home, fly...
And I'll raise my head up,
And I'll raise my arms up,
And I'll flutter on, beautiful, flutter on, beautiful, flutter on, beautiful, flutter on, beautiful
Butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly...
And I'll raise my wings up,
and I'll shed this shell off,
And I'll flutter on, beautiful, flutter on, beautiful, flutter on, beautiful, flutter on, beautiful
Butterfly, yeah
Flutter on, beautiful
Butterfly, yeah
If what I know is real,
If what I know is all,
I'm dying, I'm dying
Flutter on beautiful, flutter on beautiful.
I'm dying beautiful, I'm dying beautiful.
Flutter on, I'm beautiful.
Fly, I'm beautiful.
Butterfly, I'm beautiful.
Butterfly, yeah.
Butterfly, butterfly...
And I see in my eyes,
And I feel in my skin,
And I walk in my world, 
And I feel that I'm dying...
