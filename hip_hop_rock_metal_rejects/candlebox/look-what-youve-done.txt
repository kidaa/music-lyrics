I can borrow, if you've got the time
I never needed anybody's help to make up my mind
You won't be here long
Enough to stand out
You're on fi fi fire till everybody finds out
Look what you've done, done to my head
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Done to my head, you've got me thinking
Maybe I will and maybe I won't
Maybe I can't but God only knows
I won't be the puppet strings you hold on
Come tomorrow, it's a sign of the times
It's coming down now
Shelter won't save you my friend
So sit dow till you learn 
And sit down till you grow
You mi mi mi might turn if you'd only let yourself go
Look what you've done, done to my head
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Done to my head,
Maybe I will and maybe I won't 
Maybe I can't but God only knows
I won't be the puppet strings you hold on
I see you depend over and over on logic
I can't understand
Who kept you floating, my friend?
Kept your head above water
Rough seas hit you harder
I should have just let you drown
Maybe I will and maybe I won't
Maybe I can't, but God only knows
