Who was it set you off today?
Always someone wants to take a bow
So you leave it now where you left it off
And then I watch you carry it all
Sometimes we'll slip, fall, fade
We'll fuck it all up
Leaing this town we'll all go 
Who was it set you up today?
Always someone wish to pull it off
So they'll pick it up where we let it fall
And then we'll watch them stumble alone
Sometimes we whine to fine-tune our own souls
Leaving this town it's too slow
In all ways in 2 days
Gotta breakaway now from this town
Gotta breakaway now from it all
Gotta breakaway now and soar high
Never gonna come down
Who was it let you down today?
Always someone who takes it over all
So we'll leave 'em out and break free from the fault
And then we'll watch them learn to crawl
In time they'll slip, fall, fade
They'll fuck it all up
We're leaving this town we'll let them go
in all ways for 2 days
Gotta breakaway now from this town
Gotta breakaway now from it all
Gotta breakaway now and soar high
Never gonna come down
Leave me alone, you want to drag off my cigarette
Find your own, life, it never made promises
In my face again, you know you were never meant
No time for fucking arrogance
