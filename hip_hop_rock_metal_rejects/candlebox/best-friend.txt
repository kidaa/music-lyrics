Quiet down now, hush hush my friend.
Quiet down now, hush hush my friend.
When all the others left, when all the others left,
When all the others left, when all the others...
I knew you'd stick around, come here now.
I knew you'd stick around, come here now.
When all the others talked, when all the others talked,
When all the others talked, when all the others...
You'd always been my habit now.
Coloured bees, and stomach aches,
Your friend's in need, and lovers quakes.
My best friend, my, my very best friend,
My best friend, my, she never left my side.
So come here now sit.  Quiet down.  Come here now sit.
So lie down now, quiet down friend
Quiet down now, quiet down friend...
When all the others left, when all the others left,
When all the others left, when all the others...
I knew you'd stick around, come here now.
Come here now sit, so come here now.
When all the others talked, when all the others talked,
When all the others talked, when all the others...
You'd always been my habit now.
Coloured bees and stomach aches,
Yours friend's in need, and lovers quakes.
My best firned, my, my very best firned,
My best firned, my, she never left my side.
So lie down now, quiet down friend
Lie down now, lie down now sit.
My side so lie down and fight to find
My side so lie down and fight for my,
quiet down now, hush hush my friend
My side to lie down be good for my,
come here now, come here now sit
My side to lie down be good for my,
Quiet down now, hush hush my friend.
Come here now, come here now sit.
When all the others left, I knew you'd stick around.
When all the others talked, I knew you'd stick around.
Lie down now, lie down my friend.
Lie down now, hush hush my friend.
My best friend, my, my very best friend.
