I see him everyday 
In that blanket that he calls home
I wonder does he know 
That his family they're left alone
He says brother can you spare
Can you spare a dime
See I'm down to my last dollar
And this life of mine
Said this life of mine
It gets rough at times
And I wonder does he know
Does he even care
That his family's safe at home and they wonder where
As he wanders through his life ever searchin' for
A warm blanket on warm fields and he wanders on
And I wonder is he safe from the cold
Well I see he left the other day
Took his blanket that he called home 
I wonder did he go for good
Or did he pass away 
Well I wonder does he know
Now I'm down to my last dollar
And this life of mine
It gets rough at times
It gets rough at times
And I wonder does he know
Does he even care
That times
It gets rough at times
And I wonder does he know
Does he even care
That my family's safe at home
And I wonder where 
As I wander through my life
Ever searchin' for 
My warm blanket on fields as I wander on
And I wonder
Will I always be helped along I said I
I'll never know
Because I
I'll never go and yes, I
I wonder why
Because I
I'll never go home
I'll never come home
