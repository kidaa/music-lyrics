Breathe in
Are you the one about to crash it all?
You take another hit in time you'll fall, all the way
Summertime sidelines
Well you're the one about to crash it all
And you're the one who likes to blame us all
Consider this
Alright, You're the one fading baby 
Well you're the one fading baby 
Fading
My life, well everyone's taking stock in me
And everyone listens so faithfully to hear what's right from wrong
it's all they'll ever know
Alright, you're the one fading baby
Well you're the one fading baby 
Fading
If I ever want to take my chance again, it's life
If I ever want to take my chance again again
So real, oh baby you're so real
Alright, life well everyone serves themselves you'll see
As hungry as you are to cash in on me, you'll be left in the cold
Fading, if I ever want to take my chance again, it's life
If I ever want to take my chance again again
So real, oh baby you're so real
Find your own life, live, it's far too hard to be alone
These lines you cross, they won't hinder me at all
I feel alive, graced beside
I owe all I loathe to you
Oh baby you're so real
