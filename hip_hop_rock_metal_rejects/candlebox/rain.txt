Well I wope up one morning 
Seen my baby fly away
Sugar don't go
She said I don't be treatin' her
Right by the things I say
Sugar don't go
Don't go, I feel I'll be left alone
And I'll cry
Oh in the rain
Early one morning I packed her bags
She said she gotta leave me now
I've done her wrong
I said baby I'm gonna change
Gonna change for the better
Sugar don't go
You can't be leaving me so alone
And I'll cry in the rain
In the rain
Oh in the rain
In the rain
Sugar go
Now sugar go you leave me alone
As you packed your bags
You've got your plane on the road
I said oh why'd you leave
Oh why'd you leave
You gotta leave me alone
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
You gotta back off
Baby you treat me
Baby you treat me
My life and I could take my time
I lose it
What I have
Is what I have
Is what I give to you
And I feel I'm gone
I've been crying

And where you gonna stay 
Say where you gonna go
