Turn me into, another corner.
See I'm sideways, I'm unopened.
I let it before I lose myself, I'm empty and inspired alone
And I swear, I can say to you.  And I swear, I can say to you.
So I write it down, and slip away from faith.
Frustrated and anxious to grow.
Addressed in clothes that never fit my mind,
Letters said but never closed last time,
And I can say to you.  And I swear, I can say to you.
You tell me...
Oh, when did we start to drown,
You see I'll hold you there.
Oh, when did we start to drown,
Can't you see it's time we made it home.
Oh, when did we start to drown? drown...
When did we start to
When did we start to drown...
So I see you turn it into your lines my way.
You see I'm angry, and I'll set you straight.
Let it before I loes control,
You find out, and I'll fight it alone.
And I swear, I can say to you.  And I swear, I can say to you.
Yes, I swear, I can say to you.
Somebody tell me,
Oh, when did we start to drown,
You think I'll hold you there.
Oh, when did we start to drown,
Can you see it's time we made it home.
Oh, when did we start to drown?
Always on my mind, time for you temper.
Always on my mind, sent to my mind I know.
Always on my mind, I'll hold your thoughts I swear, always...
So you turn me, so you turn it...
Turn me into another corner,
And you put me in this, this other corner.
Turn it into another corner,
You'll tell me...
When did we start to drown,
You see I'll hold you there.
Oh, when did we start to drown?
Can't you see it's time we made it home
Oh, when did we start to,
Drown???...
