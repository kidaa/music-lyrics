She looks up - wiped the tears from her eyes
she's fourteen - wants her father to die
sadism sucks - mother surrenders on fear
she ain't gonna cry - nothing left to feel
he will never turning - her heart was burning
eye to eye, her cradle was rocked - run away
Hand tough - troublemaker  hang tough - troublemaker
hang tough - troublemaker  he's burning now in flames
She woke up - he slapped her face  darkened the room - try to violate her
she tried to talk - he made her a fool  look out - it could happen near you
neighbours don't listen - swallow the pain
she planned her vengeance today - run away
one shot - his blood congeals in tears will a judge listen
can he repeat her fourteen years
Troublemaker  troublemaker
