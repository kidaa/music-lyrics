She used to be a girl, that you'll never leave
I don't pray for forgiveness  her eyes make you believe
poisoned deep inside by jealousy  no more memories will haunt me
What a fool am I - I light a candle  the gates of eden were closed
the magic has gone from her smile  no future was in her eyes
I had enough of bad news
In the midnight hour, I will start all over now
no more hate - no more shadows of the past
a wall of silence surrounded every dream
and the fear of lost emotion  turn a whisper to a scream
And the river runs dry  and we just take life for granted
till the day that we'll die  till the river runs dry
and I don't forget the moment  the last look in your eyes  the river runs dry
I still live here, she's till around  but I knew it before
when she walked out the door  but I never saw through
Through the river of tears  just throw me down a sign from heaven
And the river runs dry  and we just take life for granted
till the day that we'll die  and the river runs dry
and I don't forget the moment  the last look in your eyes
And the river runs dry  and we just take life for granted
till the day that we'll die  till the river runs dry
and I don't forget the moment  the last look in your eyes
till the river runs dry  and the river runs dry
and we just take life for granted  till the day that we'll die
till the river runs dry  and I don't forget the moment
the last look in your eyes
