Twisted the daydream - a memory with pain
I'm looking through a hole in my wall
I want to dive with both of you  in the middle of this night
trapped in the reflections, you're in sight
I was paralyzed at first, before you realized
I'm walking through these red lights blue  met your fascinating eyes
where's the one who's to blame...  In the streets of sin
The first time when I saw you  I couldn't speak a word
all the meaniest things surrounded me  to love somebody secretly
can hurt so many times  it's heaven's jungle - I'm inside
I was paralyzed at first, before you realized  torn away your jealousy
if you'll live your dark desire  where's no one who's to blame...
In the streets of sin  the streets of sin  the streets of sin
It's game - you just can't win  in the streets of sin
Twisted little daydream - a memory with pain
I'm looking through a hole in my wall
I want to dive with both of you  in the middle of this night
trapped in reflections, you're in sight
I was paralyzed at first, before you realized  torn away all jealousy
if you'll live your dark desire  where's no one who's to blame...
In the streets of sin  the streets of sin  the streets of sin
It's game - you just can't win  in the streets of sin
A pocket full of money - a long night to do  a felt so unsure inside
is this the price, well I'm paying for  or a paradise of lies
in the streets of sin  the streets of sin  the streets of sin
it's game - you just can't win  the streets of sin
the streets of sin  the streets of sin  it's game - you just can't win
the streets of sin...
