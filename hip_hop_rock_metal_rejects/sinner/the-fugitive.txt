I realized the blue sky black  I felt the whole world's fading in my hands
I will meet you after dark  ain't no sunshine in my heart
a quite deep river is running down  to the places we'd belong
Walk on in - I can't hear you calling, hear you
walk on in - I can't hear you calling, hear you
I'm remembering your smile  so tell me what you think  then I can break the ice
before your roses fade away  give me another chance to stay
when feeling show where we should go  it will never been in vain
Just for you I'll walk on water  walk with you through the powering rain
baby this darkness is getting closer  hell I'm goin' insane
Seven sins and twenty dreams  you have to face reality
let me heal your broken wing  let's go our own way
Walk on in - I can't hear you calling, hear you
walk on in - I can't hear you calling
