I'm gonna push it hard the untouched mystery
on the highest level, ready for speed  dark dimensions in the killing zone
a detonations cracking behind the wall
you gotta hold on, when illusion's gettin' real
you gotta hold on, no more limits
Thunder roars and siren sounds  I walk the darkness, hit the ground
sink or swin, do or die  sharper than a serpent's bite
you gotta hold on, when illusion's gettin' real
you gotta hold on, no more limits
You gotta go - deathwalker  you gotta go - deathwalker  you and me
you gotta go - deathwalker  you gotta go - deathwalker  you and me
Far too long your time has come  look to the left, look to the right
and if you're ready to rumble  for a fight in the night
and when your time is over you're gonna die
you gotta hold on, when illusion's gettin' real
you gotta hold on, no more limits
Deathwalker, deathwalker  you gonna go
