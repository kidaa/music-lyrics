Breathe fire - I'm knee deep in your lies
where's the guy above - he's my alibi
no sign, no helping hand as the going gets tough
I lost all my faith, all hope in mercy from above
I saw the pope kissing concrete  a mile away a hundred children bleed
White lightning - stop frightening  give me a deep breath of live
white lightning - I'm gonna play it my way  and it's so dark inside
Where's the lord - who let all these children die
the church pretends the mess we're in  back in the real world
where weird things affect our live
look into the future unholy visions will rise
They showed me jesus wearing a cross  next a bald child, bone cancer she's lost
A white lightning  a white lightning
