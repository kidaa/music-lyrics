The day the world's colliding  the sky's turning red  the same excuses as always
world's rotten in their hands  visualized destruction, there is no one to blame?
And what's the value for a human life  on a mission 'survival'
this is not the war between good and evil
it's time for pure instinct to save our soul
The school of hard knocks  one in up - one is down
and there's greed all around  and you're caught in
the school of hard knocks  one in up - one is down
and there's greed all around  and you're caught in
the school of hard knocks
They got the dollars in their hearts  it's not garbage they take
they got the power in their hands  and what's the price they will pay
this is not the war between good and evil
it's time for pure instinct to save our soul
you won't believe my warnings  I can hear mother nature's calling
if wasteland's gettin' cold  count to ten...and explode
one in up - one is down  and there's greed all around
and you're caught in  the school of hard knocks
The school of hard knocks
