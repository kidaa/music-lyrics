Sleepwalk in the sunrise, no signs - no boundaries
I hear a speculation, the world just won't believe
Don't try to run you can't win  just push the button - fulfilled
here and forever - no rules  holy ground can't be cured
When you're out on the run, you're under the gun
you better get used to the truth
when you're out on the run - still on the loose
you better get used to  used to the truth
Breathing under water  the truth just makes me sick
the next generation sold out and nature  screams
When you're out on the run, you're under the gun
you better get used to the truth
when you're out on the run - still on the loose
you better get used to the truth  used to the truth
Our god's finest creation - sacrificed for deals
the kiss of death is in the air  no secret that can heal
When you're out on the run, you're under the gun
you better get used to the truth
when you're out on the run - still on the loose
you better get used to  used to the truth
Used to the truth  used to the truth
