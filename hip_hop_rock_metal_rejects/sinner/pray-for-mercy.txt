Remember when you've said 'goodbye'  first can I die, then I would fight
there is no hope in every kind a dope  the same for your bottle of alcohol
you get down to the ground  you don't care what's worth believing
now I don't mind
I'll turn you hot and sober  till you will pray for mercy
there is just one thing  you go down, down, down
There is nothing left to lose  you can load my weapon, pull me through
and if you're looking for your dealer  trust me babe, I'll play the healer
the sweet brown sugar took her  she didn't come back  obsessed by taboos
Remember when you've said 'goodbye'  first can I die, then I would fight
there is no hope in every kind a dope  the same for your bottle of alcohol
If you're a true believer  there is no time for feelings
there is just one thing  you go down, down, down
Pray for mercy  pray for mercy  you go down, down, down
