A fool on the tightrope, the first step is pain
one moment not careful and your life was in vain
remember the first time, remember the sin
where's all the warnings blown in the wind
You roll the dice for your own paradise
Do you hear me - do you see me  we will meet on judgement day
do you hear me - do you see me  we will meet on judgement day
Another cool skin - tight look  another temptation
the thin line is calling you again  what will you do, will you bleed forever
the suicide way  you can't wash away mistakes  no healing - just pray
Remember the first time, remember the sin
where's all the warnings blown in the wind
