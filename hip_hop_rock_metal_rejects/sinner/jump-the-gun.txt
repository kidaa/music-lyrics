Dreams come and go  don't lose your self control  the prophets of doom
don't leave us alone  dreams come and go in black & white  the future is gold
count on me if you're scared  till the dam broke - walk the edge
the real world is gone but we stay
We jump the gun - the systems are falling  but we still jump the gun
another world is dying - jump the gun
Believe it or not, things will happen here  in the name of god
count on me if you're scared  till the dam broke - walk the edge
the real world is gone but we stay
Give me one good reason  only mind games can tear us apart
count on me if you're scared  till the dam broke - walk the edge
the real world is gone but we stay
We jump the gun - the systems are falling  but we still jump the gun
another world is dying - jump the gun
Jump the gun
