When it's late and stars go to sleep
I lie and wait for a new Dream
My State of Grace ...
When light fades
everything 'round
melts with shades
in a Time-Escape
It's my world made for my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I need everyday
So many days without a smile
I need to stay and rest for a while
In my world made of my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I feel everyday
SOLO: THRSEN/RAIN/TOGETHER
It's my world made for my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I need everyday
