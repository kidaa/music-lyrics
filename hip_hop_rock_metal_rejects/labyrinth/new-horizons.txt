Another day is dying
Moonlight' shining high
Peace is winding all around
I look up to the sky
a sudden blazing light
shaking my soul to the ground
Across the seas, around the hills and over
I can feel all your love ...
Reflections of a wasted love in my eyes
unchaining from my heart
Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...
Another day is dying
Moonlight' shining high
Peace is winding all around
Despite of Master's will
Against this destiny
I will find the way to try ...
Across the seas, around the hills and over
I can feel all your love ...
Reflections of a wasted love in my eyes
unchaining from my heart
Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...
SOLO: RAIN/THRSEN/TOGETHER
Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...
To new horizons fly ...
