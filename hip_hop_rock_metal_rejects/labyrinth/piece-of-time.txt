Slowly you inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of ludicity
Somewhere I'm waiting for a sign that shows me a direction
Let me across the Labrinth
I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
I please you don't forget
It's too late to make a change
This wasteland can feel my agony
I've heard the distance in your voice
I live and learn by my mistakes
Slowly you inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of ludicity
I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
I please you don't forget
I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
Again to close your eyes
