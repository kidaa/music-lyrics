I've walked in the street of yesterday
I've walked with your eyes as blue as the sky
And we learned the hard way
we wanted to live forever
everyone together
walking to red zone through the silence of night
I've looked at the city of yesterday
And we've paid with our lives
we wanted to live forever
everyway together
I've broken everything we've made ...
... we wanted to live forever
everyway together
