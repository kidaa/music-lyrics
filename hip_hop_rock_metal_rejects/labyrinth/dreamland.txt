Night is leaving too early
My dreams are falling away
I lie dreaming to run close
why are you fading away from me?
Lost in you I'm running nowhere
Searching for the land of dreams where do you live?
are you somewhere? ... Somewhere in my mind ...
... in Dreamland ...
A light flashes my mind
brightening finally all the air
you standing tall watching me
your eyes are pulling me over time
Lost in you I won't awake
riding for the land of dreams
going somewhere, somewhere in my mind ...
... in Dreamland ...
Living nowhere, somewhere in my mind
riding somewhere, going everywhere
searching for the land of dreams where do you live?
... in timeless Dreamland ...
