Faced to the ivory gates of dreamsland
I look my steps being lost in the sand
Is this the place where they created your soul
Where all your tears have been shed for so long?
Moon don't tell me lies
don't let me roam forever
Moonlight take the sky
Show me the way to heaven ...
Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away
Leaving the town of the ancient dreams
new reasons come to live for ...
Now that we are leaving out of maze
I can imagine all the masters' rage
Meaning is that love is stronger than hate
Meaning is that will is stronger than fate
Moon don't tell me lies
don't let me roam forever
Moonlight take the sky
Show me the way to heaven ...
Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away
SOLO: RAIN/THRSEN
Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away
