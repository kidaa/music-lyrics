I believe in the power of love
I want to see a change in the future
take me to places I've never seen
all of you have to pay
Gods you know?
Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power
I believe in the power of love
I want to see a change in the future
take me to places I've never seen
all of you have to pay
Gods you know?
Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power
Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power
