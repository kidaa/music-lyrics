Too far away her eyes surround me
her smile fills my heart
and I'm awaiting for my destiny
and I've been waiting for the stranger
to show me what he knows
he's looking sad, he knows my destiny
Fantasy in my mind
She's standing near my shadow
I open my eyes show me the way
Too far away her eyes surround me
her smile fills my heart
and I'm looking for our destiny
and I've been waiting for the stranger
to show me what he knows
he's looking sad, he knows my destiny
Time has come for me to live another day
Time has come we'll dance again ...
Close your eyes now you realize a day
when we'll meet again
all this time I've wanted to say
time has come
so many tears ... don't close your eyes
I can't live without you so many days ...
and when you smile I can fly ...
Time has come for me to live another day
Time has come we'll dance again ...
Time has come for me to live another day
Time has come we'll dance again ...
