Livin' in a wasteland
without any shadows
what's left for me to see?
I wonder with my soul
Your Angel-eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand
All I know is I can't live with you
In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember
Fear lives inside your mind
but my dream is still alive
and I'm never looking back
I'm dreaming peace and love
Find you lost in any place
I'm miles away
I'll be searching high and low
In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember
