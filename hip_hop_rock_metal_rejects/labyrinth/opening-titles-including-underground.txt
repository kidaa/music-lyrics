It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell echo hurts like hell

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah ,ah

It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground
