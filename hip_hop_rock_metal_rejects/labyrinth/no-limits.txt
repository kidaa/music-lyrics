Can you remember the time
now I'm standing in this way
All my life for this time
Why? Can you feel me in this time?
Why? Can you see me in this time?
All that we love shall burn
No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow
Can you remember the time
Why? Can you feel me in this time?
Why? Can you see me in this time?
All that we love shall burn
No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow
Sitting all alone in the corner
a man is on the razor's edge
now the woman's crying ...
the woman's into a secret place
many, many miles away
she dreams of love
No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow
