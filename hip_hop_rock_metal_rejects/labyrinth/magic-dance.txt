You remind me of the baby
What baby? the baby with the power
What power? power of voodoo
Who do? you do
Do what? remind me of the baby

I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do?
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew:

CHORUS
  What kind of magic spell to use?
  Slime and snails
  Or puppy dogs' tails
  Thunder or lightning
  Then baby said
  Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
  Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
  Put that baby spell on me
  Jump magic, jump jump magic, jump
  Jump magic, jump jump magic, jump
  Put that magic jump on me
  Slap that baby, make him free

I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try
What could I do?
My baby's fun had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

CHORUS

Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance x4
Jump magic, jump jump magic, jump x2

Put that baby spell on me ooh

You remind me of the baby
What baby? the baby with the power
What power? power of voodoo
Who do? you do
Do what? remind me of the baby

Dance magic, dance, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic, dance magic, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic

What kind of magic spell to use?
Slime and snails
Or puppy dogs' tails
Thunder or lightning
Something frightening

Dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance
Put that baby spell on me
Jump magic, jump
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby make him free
Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
Jump magic, jump jump magic, jump
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby

Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance
Slap that slap that baby make him free
Dance magic, dance dance magic, dance repeat ad-lib
