Father, please, take care of my soul
maybe I won't be so strong
Time has come for me to close my wings
and pay for my Mortal sin
You ... don't try to stop the Pain that rides
into my veins - inside
it's like a river flowing straight
fulfilled of Hate
Time after time
but what has left behind?
nothing else than lies ...
All this long time got me to find
they sealed my Heaven Denied
Stop this Hatred burning in my head
now i'd need to forget
You ... don't try to stop the Pain that rides
into my veins - inside
it's like a river flowing straight
fulfilled of Hate
Time after time
but what has left behind?
nothing else than lies ...
All this long time got me to find
they sealed my Heaven Denied
Time after time tonight
we can finally see the light
it's light of love calling me
am I dreaming, is it real?
... No more lies ...
SOLO: RAIN/THRSEN
Time after time ...
