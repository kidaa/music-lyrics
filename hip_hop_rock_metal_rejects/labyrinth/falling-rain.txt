Deep in my heart i would like find
A place for love ...
It's not so easy as i'd like ...
And all this time, all this time we lost
just to follow a dream ...
Nothing will remain ...
The rain is falling down onto me
falling down as a silent cry
Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
i can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...
It's not our way and i think
you gotta find one
a little angel starts to cry
This falling rain is telling now
a love is dying
but it will live into your heart
The rain is falling down to me
falling down as a silent cry
Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
i can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...
Deep in my heart i would like find
A place for love ...
and all this time
all the time we lost
just to follow a dream ...
Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
I can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...
Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
I can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring in the mirror and
all around
nothing but falling rain ...
