Eleven masters, eleven lights
eleven fires burning bright
A fall of tears flows the night
She takes my hands and closes her eyes
Refuse to be the God they want
refuse to leave the girl I love
The cheeky deed defied their pride
no mercy inside their eyes
They will remember the time
When i did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman
A goldian flash divides my hands
a sudden night and now she's lost
Lost in time in the land of dreams
Wasted wall of celestial maze
The Guardian Angel is calling now
gates of pain unclose for me
Lost in maze i'll look for her
She'll guide me along to find the way
They will remember the time
When i did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman
We shall remember the time
When we did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman
