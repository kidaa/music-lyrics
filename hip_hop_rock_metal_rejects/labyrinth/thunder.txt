Look at the fire and follow the light
dancing around in the night
look at it's flames burning up, reaching out for the Sky
That is the way I could say how I feel
feeling the flame burning me
flowin' inside out my blood cold as steel
like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...
I feel Fire is burning inside
my reason's losing the fight
my lust for Vengeance is calling and claiming my Pride
Look at the fire and follow the light
dancing around in the night
look at it's flames burning up, reaching out for the Sky
like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...
SOLO: THRSEN/RAIN
like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...
