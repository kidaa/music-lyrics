Staying behind the stars
I look at the world and I listen to reason ...
I hear an innocent voice, it whispers me
a new law
it whispers me the way
and i'm sleeping with my dreams
Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me
Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight
Look another way
Where moonlight takes the sky
I see the shadows of nighttime
spinning around me ...
A mirage in the night
It's a magic for my heart
a drop stolen from in the sea of Eternity
Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me
Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight
I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight ...
Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me
