No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell echo
But down in the underground oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find someone true down underground
Down in the underground oh oh oh oh oh
A land serene oh oh oh oh
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground
