Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again
Wake up from the night
Flowing in your mind
time has gone, but something's left behind
... a little twinkling light ...
light of wasted memories
tell me, can you see?
Everyone has one, somewhere in his heart
... you simply gotta find.
Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again
Tell me what you feel
Tell me what you need
If you're calling for some help on your way
... I promise. I'll be there ...
Please don't ask me why,
Please don't make me lie
Life is like a game in wich you win or lose
but you can't ever choose
Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again
SOLO: TOGETHER/RAIN/THRSEN
Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again
