Close your eyes, can you see?
It's the land of Secret Dreams Take my hands.
Follow me where Time escapes from Reality
Can you feel the loneliness burning in my heart?
I would need an Angel to teach me again to fly
Fly to me and save me
Heal my broken wings
Close your eyes and kiss me
'cause tonight
It's The night of Dreams
and your crystal - eyes could drive me to the light
It's The night of Dreams
and I can finally dream to fly
higher, till the sky
Every day and every night I look up for your eyes
rain is falling from the sky like tears and I don't like
Fly to me and save me
Heal my broken wings
Close your eyes and kiss me
'cause tonight
It's The night of Dreams
and your crystal - eyes could drive me to the light
It's The night of Dreams
and I can finally dream to fly
higher, till the sky
Now I wonder what I would ever have been
If I had never met you
Stars in the sky are shining as never before
Now I can answer, I know "What is Love?"
SOLO: THRSEN/RAIN
Fly to me
It's the night
