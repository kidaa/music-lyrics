Over the starlights
There's a world nobody's seen before
... There's my world ...
I still remember
When they banished me for my sin
... and you with me ... 
"Remember my words - I said - One day I'll come back"
I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once i had gone, today I'll turn to light am I dreaming?
SOLO: THRSEN
Feelings of peace
fighting with this Harred in my heart
... I need more time ...
Stay close to me 
Close your eyes and use your heart to see
... Pure as steel ... 
And flying with me you will see
that Heaven I lost for you
I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once I had gone, today I'll turn to light
SOLO: THRSEN/RAIN/THRSEN
I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once i had gone, today I'll turn to light
Dayafterdayafterdayafterday ...
