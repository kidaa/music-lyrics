Come to the city where madness takes over
come to the land where the nightmare comes true
Open your mind to a fantasy-travel
where no more rules dominate out this world
I know and i remember the silences
I've seen and i don't relate of death
All i've seen and all i wanted
i wasted my time, now i flow with the sand
I've never begun, i haven't finished, yet ...
I am a step out of memory
