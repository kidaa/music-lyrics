Ready to sin for the pride of my king
ready to leave for his love
What a stranger world, where a kingdom may fall
for a "caprice" of a lord
In my hall there's a reek of sin that flows
lost in the darkness i can feel your presence
my shame won't be cleansed anymore
Save me, oh my God
'cause i've got to sell my soul
won't you save me once again?
Won't you hear my silent pray?
Slave to a portrait, the king fell in love
"bring me that girl", his final word
Should ever a poor man, as i really am
live by his faith, or obedience
