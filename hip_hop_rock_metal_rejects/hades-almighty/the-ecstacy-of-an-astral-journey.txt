Burning Midnight Skies
The Blaze Of The Stars Is Calling Again
Wispering Mystic Chorus
A Promise Of Immortality
Take My Soul To Where The Falcons Fly
To The Gates Of Triumph
The Skies Are Bleeding Like An Open Wound
We Are Born Again
Burning Midnight Skies
The Queen Of The Night Have Raised Again
She Is The Goddess Of Where Our Journey Ends
Take My Soul To Where The Falcons Fly
I Ride On A Taill Of Moonfog
Throughout The Burning Midnight Skies
Thy Queen - The Goddess
The Enemy Of Christ
I Greet You On Your Throne Of Star Dust
Teach Me The Art Of Erotic Sin
Grant Me The Source Of Bestial Lust
Take My Soul To Where The Falcons Fly
To The Gates Of Triumph
Forever Free
Burning Midnight Skies!!!!
Burning Midnight Skies!!!!
