Glow but don't shine,
A fuse for a blueprint devices my hands built,
For these roads want the rain in my raincoat,
Drown in the flash flood,

For we are alive,
Given air; not used to Al Fresco,
Does the sun know,
Today, I forgot the zeros and ones,
Told you to conquer the rush,
Sunday, I remembered paper beats rock,
Reached a mile high if I reached a foot,

Leopard skin is not above or beyond,
He's no more a prince than a frog is,
For these roads should not have shed for a witness,
Taken bites to avenge us,

For we are alive,
Given air; not used to Al Fresco,
Does the sun know,
Today, I forgot the zeros and ones,
Told you to conquer the rush,
Sunday, I remembered paper beats rock,
Reached a mile high if I reached a foot,

I'm figuring out the one thing he's not is above or beyond,
And no one's packing up, taking on or making goodbye for me all alone,

Today, I forgot the zeros and ones,
Told you to conquer the rush,
Sunday, I remembered paper beats rock,
Reached a mile high if I reached a foot.
