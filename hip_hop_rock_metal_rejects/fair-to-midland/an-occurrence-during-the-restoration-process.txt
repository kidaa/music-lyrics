Bought a picture of jesus,
Held it in the mirror and he saw a picture of himself,
Spoke life to the children,
You see things aren't put into words
They're polished and not felt. you might be right.

Look behind the bush lies a rivertree,
Hands cuffed and bound so as to limit speech,
Woke up to keep an eye on everything,
Maybe the statue will step out and make a scene,

Raise your hand,
Like an animal,
Raise your voice,
Like an avalanche,
Raise you hand,
Like a senator,
Raise your voice.

Dear abby,
Thanx for the message,
Gonna bring some gifts of freedom,
To compensate for whats on the inside,
Compensate for whats on the inside,
Dear charlie,
Changed with the in crowd,
Made your mark on jesus,

I'll see you again when hell freezes over,
See you again when hell freezes over.
