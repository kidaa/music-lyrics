While i'm young i'm gonna waste my breath,
Watch as they congregate,
I'm gonna take his steps,
Repeat and circle left,
Right now he's still not listening.

While i'm young i'm gonna waste my time,
Because i'm already aging,
Can't you reason like on t.v.?
Where you won't feel alone?
It's a bit too much,
But i'm just asking.

I'm not made of gold or silver now.
Bronze is sharp and always used it's edge.
Well i've seen your smile and still it cracks like whips.
When i go bankrupt i'll be filthy rich.
