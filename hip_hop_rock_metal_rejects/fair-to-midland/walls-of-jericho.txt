What splendidly weaved from an atom bomb,
Retrieved from a teleprompt,
Practical, you are not,
Break the ice with a cotton swab,
A fever that cools us all,
Handshake's a contact sport,

No one was waiting to throw out the pilot,
We'll float on the back of the winds that you send us,

Another tomorrow, 
Shedding the shade we made yesterday,
Disguised as the lightning,
Dissolving all of the thunder,
Then appeasing a monster under the acrylic skies,
Another tomorrow,

So grab my hand here comes the crash,
I live for the strong impact that renders both our airbags,
Takes very letter you send,
Don't fold if you're made to bend,
Rekindle the feud again,

No one was waiting to throw out the pilot,
We'll float on the back of the winds that you send us,

Another tomorrow, 
Shedding the shade we made yesterday,
Disguised as the lightning,
Dissolving all of the thunder,
Then appeasing a monster under the acrylic skies,
Another tomorrow,

Did you recognize your next door neighbor today,

String up your harp,
Play like today will last five minutes,
This won't take long,
Sing us a song that stops the silence,

Another tomorrow, 
Shedding the shade we made yesterday,
Disguised as the lightning,
Dissolving all of the thunder,
Then appeasing a monster under the acrylic sky,
Another tomorrow.
