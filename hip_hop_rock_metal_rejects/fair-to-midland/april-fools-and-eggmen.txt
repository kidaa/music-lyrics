Rest assured they're weighing words in sympathetic ink,
And they don't waste their time suspending disbelief,
They face the facts with thinking caps,
They map out and display,
But that's not the only way,

Common sense won't pay the rent and doesn't grow on trees,
But splitting hairs can get you anything you need,
Who would have thought connecting dots might get you to the point,
But charity is a rarity almost as much as modesty,

Take the bait and save however much it takes,
Before you've made your wish however much it takes,

Rest assured they're weighing words in sympathetic ink,
And I don't waste my time suspending disbelief,
Masterminds want bottom lines to map out and display,
If I have every bit of faith, 
I won't be turning in my grave,

Take the bait and save however much it takes,
Before you've made your wish however much it takes,

Take your own advice before you take a side,
Run for middle ground,

Take the bait and save however long it takes,
Before you've made your wish however much it takes,
Before you lie in bed, however long it takes.
