When the moon is high across the garden
that's when I'll come to you
when the nightshade blooms in your eyes
let my sin pour in you
when the forest sings like an angel's choir
I'm coming nearer
I want to feel your flesh enrapture me
and live the politics of ecstasy
In the graden there is no fear
in the garden of gray we can disappear
in the garden where I can feel
in the graden is so surreal
If the moon should pour out of the sky
and fill your livid pools
if you lay your hands on me gently
you won't be misconstrued
when you feel the shiver of lust grow deeper
i'm coming for you
I want to feel my senses sing to me
you are the music in my ecstasy
In the graden there is no fear
in the garden of gray we can disappear
in the garden where I can feel
in the graden is so surreal
I want to love you in the garden of gray
where we can stop the time and drink the ecstasy
and when its done just traces of the glow
the sparkle in your eyes is ecstasy
In the graden there is no fear
in the garden of gray we can disappear
in the garden where I can feel
in the graden is so surreal
in the graden, in the graden
in the graden, in the graden of gray
