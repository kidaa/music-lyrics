Every man will ask the questions, and every man will suffer blame and loss/ 
Every day you die a little understand the change and choose your path without disdain/ 
The seven tongues of god are in my mind, they speak to me in ancient DNR design/ 
I have never seen god, you have never seen God/ 
And when they speak to me and the seven tongues align/ 
programmed to desecrate the pretentions in your mind/ 
To further complicate I will now state that your convictions lack definition and form/ 
Every day there is a bleeding and every time I watch the world slipp by/ 
Focus, the blind pretention underscoring pain, the path to solace felt in vain/ 
The seven tongues of god are in my mind, they speak to me in ancient DNR design/ 
I have never seen god, you have never seen God/ 
And when they speak to me and the seven tongues align/ 
programmed to desecrate the pretentions in your mind/ 
to further complicate I will now state that your convictions lack definition/ 
And when they speak to me and the seven tongues align/ 
programmed to desecrate the pretentions in your mind/ 
To further complicate I will now state that your convictions lack definition and form/ 
To see the light is the purest form of reward
