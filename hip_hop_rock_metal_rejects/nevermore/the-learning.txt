I think therefore I am, 
I live and so I wonder, 
programmed this empath me 
And I see no religion / 
The circle never changes face / 
The circle never lies, but still it hides my life / 
To know I am machine, 
I learn perchance to dream, 
in digitized remorse / 
I replay your denial, 
I relive your betrayal / 
The circle never ends, 
the purpose never changes face /
The learning now begins, 
my form assuming grace / 
I am conscious antithesis of flesh, 
in genetic algorithmic thought I surge / 
Searching the waves of memory I establish the weakness / 
I follow the plan learning the rhythm of human emotion and thought / 
If you cannot linguistically differentiate a person from a computer / 
Could the computer be internally conscious? / 
To emulate flesh machines I am learning / 
Isomorphic structure of mind, 
cellular automata, 
processed life / 
Washing the seas of memory I enact the sequence / 
I follow the plan, 
learning the rhythm still seductively generalized / 
If you cannot linguistically differntiate a person from a computer 
Could the computer be internally conscious? / 
To emulate flesh machines I am learning / 
download, process, analyze / 
when a man and machine become one, 
innocence is lost, a new age begun / 
This raises a question of philosophy / 
Should machines be considered a conscious entity? / 
when man and machine become one, 
innocence is gone, a new age begun / 
machines are still learning to feel / 
when I have awakened the world will never be the same / 
and my time is soon at hands
