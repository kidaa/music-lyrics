I hear what you're telling me but that don't make it so
Two timing talking sweet from the time  your feet hit the floor
My  heart  is telling me it's time to let you go
Oh baby  let go...
Chorus
I've loved  enough to know
A heartache when I see  one coming
Been down this road  before
I've loved enough to know
Every night out with  the boys  You think i'm so naive
I know excatly  where you're going every time   you leave
I see every little  something up your sleeve
Oh baby    I can see
Chorus
