I rode by bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems that you're avoiding e
I'm ok alone but you've got something I need
Well, I've gotta brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out ya see
I've been lookin' around a while
You've got somethin' for me
Oh, I've gotta brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car
Don't go too fast, but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive I've been all around the world
Some people say I've done all right for a girl
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah,
yeah-yeah
I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone
Oh sometimes I think that you're avoiding me
I'm ok alone but you've got something I need well
Well, I've gotta brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out ya see
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, I've gotta brand new pair of roller skates
You've gotta brand key
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, I've gotta brand new pair of roller skates
You've gotta brand key
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, I've gotta brand new pair of roller skates
You've gotta brand key
