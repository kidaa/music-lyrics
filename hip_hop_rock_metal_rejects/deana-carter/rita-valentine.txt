Boy,let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine
Her name is Rita Valentine
Every summer night you can find her dancing
Barefoot under the front porch light
All the boys would bring her flowers and wine
I'd be singing,as they drove by
chorus:
If you get a hold of Rita,
Boy you better run for your life
She will lead you on one hell of a ride
When you need her she will tell you good-bye
You know,it's hard to hold on to Rita Valentine
I saw Jimmy Ray,he just ain't the same today
He and Rita went off some place
Now she's wearing a brand new ring
He said she kisses so sweet,like sugar canes
If you ask him,he will say
                  chorus
We used to laugh at the games she played
We laughed when she lost
Her heart could pay the cost,anyway
                  chorus
Let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine
Her name is Rita Valentine
