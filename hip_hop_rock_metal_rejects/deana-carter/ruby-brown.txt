She danced in the dirty streets
Satin shoes tied to her feet
People round here said she was a sight
Every night when the sun went down
She'd curtsy, and take a bow
To the man in the moon and the dim street lights
We held in high regard
The rose in the mission yard
Singing, "Buffalo Gals won't you come out tonight"
And her name was Ruby Brown
And she cam through shanty town
Like a queen without a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown
Long about ten years ago
She disappeared, why no one knows
But some say she was running for her life
'Cause a mean looking man in a limousine
Came down from New Orleans
He said he came here looking for his wife
And her name was Ruby Brown
And she cam through shanty town
Like a queen without a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown
Some was he beat her bad
'Til she just went plain mad
But I say she went where he could never go
And her name was Ruby Brown
And she cam through shanty town
Like a queen without a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown
