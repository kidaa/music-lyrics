We fell in love underneath a Michelangelo sky
We say the same things in the shapes of the clouds rolling by
A blanket of leave and the soft summer wind
Feeling the heat of the sun on our skin
That's when I learned how to fly
CHORUS
One kiss and you painted a picture of heaven
It's there when I look in your eyes
I swear I can see forever
Underneath a Michelangelo sky
Until that day I was living in black and white
The touch of your hand brings all these colors to life
I get the feeling this feeling won't fade
Here in you arms I get carried away
Back to the very first time
Repeat CHORUS, 3 times
