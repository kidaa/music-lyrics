We've always been the best of friends
No secrets and no demands
But suddenly from out of the blue
I see a different light around you
One thing I haven't told you,
I just want to hold you
And never let go,
I just want to know
Chorus
How do I get there from here
How do I make you see
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me
Lost in your lovin' arms
that's where I want to be
You know I love you
How do I get there
You probably think I've lost my mind
Takin' this chance crossin' that line
But I promise to be truer than true
Dreaming every night with these arms around you
I can't wait any longer this feeling's gettin' stronger
help me find a way
Chorus
I know the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
But I'll climb any mountain that you want me to climb
The perfect combination is your heart and mine
Darlin' won't you give me a sign
Chorus
