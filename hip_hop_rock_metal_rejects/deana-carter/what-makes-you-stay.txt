Mike Reid, Tena Clark
Look at me
I'm in a place
I never thought I'd be
Don't have the strength
To fight anymore
Or a reason not to leave
So tell me why I still keep holding on
To something I just cannot see
Chorus:
What makes you stay
When your world falls apart
What makes you try one more time
When it's not in your heart
At the end of your rope
When you can't find any hope
You still look at her and say
I just can't walk away
Tell me what makes you stay
I'm not afraid
Of living alone
I was alone before he came
I've been in love
Many times before
But this time it's not the same
I've always been the first to say goodbye
Now it's the last thing I can do
Repeat Chorus
When it goes this deep
And feels this strong
I can't convince myself
That this love is wrong
Repeat Chorus
