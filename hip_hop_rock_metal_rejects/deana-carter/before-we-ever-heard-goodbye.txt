I remember  that new pair of blue jeans
And man your boots sure did shine
You had on my favorite cologne
I knew what was on your mind
bridge
you picked me up in that mustang
You were right on time
Had the radio on   it was  playin our  song
we were leaving the world behond
Chorus
I wanna remember that loving feeling
When we were young and our hopes were high
A heart  was something   you could believe in
Love was more than just a word
Before we ever hear goodbye
That summer night down at the levee
You gave me your  ring on a chain
There would never be another for me
Tell me why does everything always have to change
Chorus
