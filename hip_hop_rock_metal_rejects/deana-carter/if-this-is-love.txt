Hold your racing horses  just one minute
A funny feeling coming over me
I'm hearing violins and Tony Bennett
Boy  if this is love then I'm in it
Chorus
It was a triple digit summer
I  thought I'd let you share my ice cream cone
We took a walk going nowhere
But I was already  already gone
The  train of love is rolling and i'm on it
Destination end of the line
Evert star  i see i wish upon it
Boy if  this is love  well then i want it
Chorus
It wasn't bad as i thought it would  be now was it
Simple as the dimple in your smile
I just  can't resist  kissin' and huggin'
Boy if this is love then i sure love it
Boy if this is love
Boy if this  is love
Boy if this is love i sure love it
