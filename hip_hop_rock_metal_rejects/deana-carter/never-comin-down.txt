Caroline was born about a mile from the Mississippi
Kinda like the kudzu, she grew up fast and pretty
A little bit of Memphis, little bit of New York City
All the boys would come around, blocking up her Daddy's driveway
But she could spot a come-one coming from a mile away
She hears them callin' but she ain't fallin'
CHORUS
She want a love that's gonna last forever
She wants to stand where her feet don't touch the ground
She'd holding out for a piece of heaven
She's gonna fly and she'd never comin' down
She'd waiting tables at her Uncle Joe's "Bar & Diner"
And it was powerful stuff when he pulled up in a big freightliner
He lit a cigarette and when their eyes met
She knew he'd carry her away
Repeat CHORUS, 3 times
She's gonna fly, She's never comin' down
She's gonna fly, She's never comin' down
She's gonna fly, She's never comin' down
