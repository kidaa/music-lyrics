I'd Like To Know
Written by Supergrass

I'd like to wake up on a Saturday,
Say hello you,
la la la la la-la
A cup of coffee and I smoke a cigarette or two,
la la la la la-la
I've never had it so good, so long, so long,
But now I've got it, it could be like before,
la la la la la-la
I like to run around with everyone, you know its true,
la la la la la-la
Driving down the street I'm always looking for a better view,
la la la la la-la

I'd like to know where all the strange ones go,
I'd like to go where all the strange ones go,
I'd like to know what all the strange ones know,
I'm gonna go where all the strange ones go,
Here_ I go.

I'd like to wake up in the middle of a dream with you,
la la la la la-la
Yeah, I'm going up and down, I'm always looking for a better view,
la la la la la-la

I'd like to know where all the strange ones go,
I'd like to go where all the strange ones go,
I'd like to know what all the strange ones know,
I'm gonna go where all the strange ones go,

Ooh---- la la la la la la__ la__ la__ la__ la__ la__ ....

I'd like to know where all the strange ones go,
I'd like to go where all the strange ones go,
I'd like to know where all the strange ones know,
I'm gonna go where all the strange ones go,
All the strange ones go.
