Ooooooooh...
Ooooooooooooh, oh yeah
Ooooooooh...
Ooooooooooooh, oh yeah

Oh you are so lazy
And I am so crazy
About the things you like to do
Well I get excited
At just at the sight of you

I don't get depression
At your full-on agression
Cos you are the cat from Kalamazoo

Well you were outstanding
And I wasn't half bad too
Well at least that's what she said

Ooooooooh...
Ooooooooooooh, oh yeah

Now hear me
Well you're under stated
Well almost sedated 
And you are the kind that can't be true
Well I get excited
At just at the sight of you

Ooooooooh...
Ooooooooooooh, oh yeah
Help me, help me, one more time
Ooooooooh...
Ooooooooooooh, oh yeah
