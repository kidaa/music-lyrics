Lucky No Fear
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

If there's a girl out there who could likely care
then there's still some hope for me.
But I'm a love lost cause so I'll stay indoors,
Oh and watching my T.V.
And I never get lucky, lucky, lucky. Oh no, not me.
For a night on the town you invited me round
for a party at your place.
But when I tried it on it all went horrible wrong
and now I'm sleeping with your cat.
Cause I never get lucky, lucky, lucky. Oh no, not me.
No, no, no, no say it's not me.
No, no, no, no say it's not me.
Lucky, lucky, lucky. Oh no, not me.
Well I was drinking red wine when I lost my mind
down the back of your settee.
You've got a really nice place but I'm off my face
and I can't stand up no more.
Cause I never get lucky, lucky, aww lucky. Oh no, not me.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no say it's not me!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no say it's not me!
