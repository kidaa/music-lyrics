Sitting Up Straight
Written by Supergrass

Sitting up straight on the back of a bus,
Mimicking time as evening turns to dusk,
Well, look at the boy with his face to the floor,
Have a little smoke just to pass the time of the day,
Oh yeah, Oh yeah,

He's like me, he'd do anything to get away,
I know, can you be there every day? I know I can believe in you,
It means everything and every power to me.

Sitting up straight on the back of a bus,
Mimicking time as evening turns to dusk,
Well, look at the boy with his face to the floor,
Have a little smoke to pass the time of the day,
Hey, hey,
Hey, hey,

He's like me,
He'll do anything to get away,
I know, can you believe it,
Everyday I Know I can believe in you,
It means, everything and every power to me,

Sitting up straight,
Sitting up straight,
Sitting up straight,
Sitting up straight,
Sitting up straight,
On the back of a bus,
On the back of a bus,
On the back of a bus,
On the back of a bus,
On the back of a bus.
