La Song
Written by Supergrass

Well we're... ruin of fables
As we drink ourselves right under the tables
Well you need an end to yesterday's papers
and tell us that they love us and hate us
...
Cos they're gonna kill us sooner or later
Yeah we really ran and ruined the fables
...climbing up the tower of ...

la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling

Well they meet in the ruin of fables
They see inside ourselves and what we are make of
Come along and stick on a label
We do the dance of the mashed potato
...
Cos they're superfragilistically-anus
...
... city of angels

la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling

la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
la-la, la-la, la-la, gotta get inside feeling
