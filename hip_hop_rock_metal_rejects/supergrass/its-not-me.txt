It's Not Me
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

Over their heads, I find a place to crawl away,
So many times, I hear the things we used to say,

Into the night, the conversation fades away,
Losing the drift of all the things I had to say,

It's not me, no, no, not me, but I don't know what is,
I try and find my peace of mind, but I know what I miss,
Now it's gone, now it's gone, now it's gone,

As everyone listened, my head turned away,
I know what I'm missing, but nothing to say,

It's not me, no, no, not me, but I don't know what is,
I try and find my peace of mind, but I know what I miss,

No, it's not me, no, no, not me, but I don't know what is,
I try and find my peace of mind, but I know what I miss.
