We're Not Supposed To
Written by Supergrass

...haaa....hey mum got any mandies?

jesus christ!! 

We're not supposed to,
Make friends with you,
Because you look so lonely,
So we're going to,
Make friends with you,

We're not supposed to,
Talk to you,
Because we know you're stranger,
But you're no stranger,
Than me or you,
Than me or you,

 ba ba ba ba ba___ ba ba ba ba ba.

But everybody's going away,
And everybody wants us to stay with you,
And everybody's coming to say,
And everybody's wants us to stay with you,

We're not suppose to,
Make love to you,
Because we know you're younger,
But you're no younger,
Than me or you,
Than me or you,
Than me or you.____
