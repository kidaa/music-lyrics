Sofa Of My Lethargy
Written by Supergrass

I wondered for a while,
I didn't have that far to go,
Waiting for a letter,
Only to discover that I'm not the same,

I know it to be true,
You're only going to go again,
Standing at the harbour,
There was only water to be talking to,

I sold it to the trees,
I didn't know which way to go,
Underneath the harbour,
Waiting for the sun to settle down,

I owe it to the dreams,
That always seem to bring me round,
Waiting at the harbour,
There was only water to be talking to,

Hold on now, all I want to do is see you,
But everybody's here just sitting 'round staring at the ceiling,
What you gonna find in your mixed up minds when you're dreaming?
Could be we're not like you at all,

Hold on now, all I want to do is see you,
But everybody's there just sitting 'round staring at the ceiling,
Funny what you find in your mixed up minds when your dreaming,
Maybe we're not like you at all
