Mansize Rooster
Written by Supergrass

Wait a minute now, you just can't run away,
You've got no money and you've got no place to stay,
Things are bad, but there's always another way,
How would you know, if you've never ever saw me?
Oh no, when I look at you, I see.----

Why you look-in' so crazy?
Why you look-in' so lonely, for love?
What do you wanna be now?
Why you look-in' so crazy?
Why you look-in' so lonely, for love?
What do you wanna see now?

Wait a minute, it's all wrong,
Wait a minute, it's all, gone, wrong,
A Rooster

Wait a minute now, you can't just hide away,
You've got no money and you've got no face to save,
You think it's bad, but there's always another way,
How would you know, if you've never ever saw me?
Oh no, when I look at you, I see.---

Why you look-in' so crazy?
Why you look-in' so lonely, for love?
What do you wanna be now?
Why you look-in' so crazy?
Why you look-in' so lonely, for love?
Where do you wanna be now oh yeah
What do you wanna see? oh yeah
What do you wanna be now? oh yeah
What do you wanna feel? oh yeah
Oh Oh_______ yeah.
