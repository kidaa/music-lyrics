Late In The Day
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

It's late in the day,
I'm thinking of you,
Things that you say,
So long, so long for me,

It's late in the day,
I'm talking to you,
Hear what I say,
So long, so long for me,

All the time I've thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
And all I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
Had thoughts of you and me again,

I lay on my bed,
Searching my mind,
Lighten my load,
So long, so long for me,

I sleep on the road,
Dream of a sound,
Coming my way,
So long, so long for me,

All the time I've thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
And all I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
Had thoughts of you and me again,

And all the time I've thought of you,
In an ordinary way,
We'd slip off down the oily way,
And all I really have to say,
As people pass along the way,
I close my eyes and turn away,
And all the time I've been with you,
In an ordinary day,
We'd trip off down the oily way,
All I really have to say,
Is people pass along the way,
And thoughts of you and me again.
