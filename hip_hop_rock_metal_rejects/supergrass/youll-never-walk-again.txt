You'll Never Walk Again
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.
Cause you're gonna get your fucking heads kicked in.
Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.
Cause you're going home in a foreign ambulance.
You'll never walk again.
You'll never walk again.

Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.
Cause you're gonna get your fucking heads kicked in.
Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.
Cause you're going home in a foreign ambulance.

If you think your hard enough.
You'll get your heads kicked in.
