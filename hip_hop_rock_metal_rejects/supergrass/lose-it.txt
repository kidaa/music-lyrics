Lose It
Written by Supergrass

Don't lose it, don't lose it,
I won't come home,
'cause you never hold my hand,

Don't lose it, no don't lose it,
I won't come home,
'cause you never hold my hand,

Ah-ah-ah-ah....won't you say my name?

So don't lose it, no don't lose it,
I won't come home,
'cause you never hold my hand,

And don't lose it, no don't lose it,
I won't come home,
'cause you never hold my hand,

Ah-ah-ah-ah....did you call my name?

I don't want anybody,
Anyway, I know too much to say,
All over again,

So don't lose it, no don't lose it,
I won't come home,
'cause you never hold my hand,

Ah-ah-ah-ah....did you call my name?
