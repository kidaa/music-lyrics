Grace
Written by Supergrass

Well we jumped all night
On your trampoline
When you kissed the sky
Made your sister scream

You ate our chips
And you drank our Coke
Then you showed me Mars
Through your telescope

Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money girl

Well you sang your songs
And you made us laugh
So we captured you
In a photograph

And when the stars came out
Your Momma called your name
When the morning comes
We'll get together again

Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money girl

Save your money
Save your money for the
Save your money for the children
Save your money for the children

One more time

Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money girl
