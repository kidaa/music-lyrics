Strange Ones
Written by Supergrass

There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the clouds and smile at,
Everyone down below,
There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the underground,
At everyone down below,

I wanna cry for you,
I wanna die for you,
Everybody needs a home,
Well, are you strange enough,
Are you deranged enough,
Every fucker needs a home,

There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the clouds and smile at,
Everyone down below,
There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the underground,
At everyone down below,

I wanna feel for you,
I wanna steal for you,
Everybody needs a home,
Well, are you strange enough,
Are you deranged enough,
Every fucker needs a home,

There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the clouds and smile at,
Everyone down below,
There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the underground,
At everyone down below,

There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the clouds and smile at,
Everyone down below,
There's a place where the strange ones go,
Where nobody here could know,
They look down from the underground,
At everyone down below.
