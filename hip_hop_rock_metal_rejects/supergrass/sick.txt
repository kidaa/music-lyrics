Sick
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

Sick, well, I've been so sick
Well, sick on your bed
Yeah, sick in your head

Now I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm so gone
I'm burnt up inside
Yeah, all my eggs have been fried
And it ain't easy now

Who knows, who cares what I think
I'm had my fill of everything
And now it's time to let it go

Ooooh, I've been sick, so sick!
Yeah, well sick on your bed
Yeah, not only on your pillow

Now I'm gone! - I'm gone
You know I'm soooo gone!
I'm burning up inside
Yeah, all my eggs have been fried
And it aint easy

Who knows, who cares what I think
I'm had my fill of everything
And now it's time to let it go
Let it go.

Who knows, who cares what I think
I'm had my fill of everything
And now it's time to let it go
Who knows, who cares what I think
I'm had my fill of everything
And now it's time to let it go, let it go, we'll let it go.
