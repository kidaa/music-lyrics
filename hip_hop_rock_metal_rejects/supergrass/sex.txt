Sex!
Written by Supergrass

Sex, is a very funny thing,
Sometimes it's good,
Sometimes it's bad,
You can't get it all the same,

First time, it can be very hard,
But, you know, you gotta try it again,
yeah, just try it again,

Now sex, is a curious thing,
Sometimes it burns,
Sometimes it stings,
Sometimes it leaves a stain,

One day, you just had enough,
Next day, you gotta do it again,
And again and again,

In one________Shepherds pie,
In two________Shepherds pie,
In three________Shepherds pie,
And Bully's special prize,
A years supply of shepherds pie oh, cheers,

Now sex, is a very funny thing,
Sometimes it [s/e]
Sometimes it [s/e]
And sometime [s/e]

The first time can be very hard,
But, you know, you gotta try it again,
yeah, you just try it again,
and again,
and that's sex.
