I've been around and around,
But I've got nowhere to go now,
But the funny thing is,
That when I'm gone, I'll kill you,

When I tell you,
I don't want you hoo-hoo,

I've been around and around,
But I've got nowhere to go now,
But the funny thing is,
That when I'm gone, I'll kill you,

When I tell you,
I don't want you hoo-hoo,

Hoo___Ahhh_______yeah,
Hoo___Ahhh_______yeah,
Hoo___Ahhh_______yeah,

I've been around and around,
But I've got nowhere to go now,
But the funny thing is,
That when I'm gone, I'll kill you,

When I tell you,
When I tell you, oh yeah,
When I tell you,
I don't want you hoo-hoo
