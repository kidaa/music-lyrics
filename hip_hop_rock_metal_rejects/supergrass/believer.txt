Believer
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

Drive through town in a left-hand drive cross the streets to the other side
I lost my line on the dashboard while I really don't know
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, ....
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, ....

We don't know what's the colour of our message
And we don't care if it's not enough for you
And if we tried some new process of selection
Not surprised though it's really nothing new

Drive through town in a left-hand drive cross the streets to the other side
I lost my line on the dashboard while I really don't know
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, ....
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, ....

I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, ....
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, ....
