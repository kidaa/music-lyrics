Don't Be Cruel
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

I'm not too happy with the state I'm in.
I try to face it but I'm here again.
There's so much love for us to feel.
I need the taste I need something clean.
With no reminder of where I've been.
And there's so much love for us to feel.
Said with my brain and I mean what I say.
Don't be cruel.
I try to explain yeah and I mean what I say.
Don't be cruel.
I got to get out of this hole I'm in.
and lose the picture of who I've been.
And there's so much love for us to feel.
I need the love I want someone here.
To ease this pain cause I got the fear.
But there's so much love for us to feel.
