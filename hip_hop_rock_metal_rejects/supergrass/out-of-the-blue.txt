Out Of The Blue
Written by Supergrass   Rob Coombes

I was a-wondering what to do, I'm on holiday,
Then it a-came out of the blue, I get mummified,
Well I was feeling so blind, I was wasting no time,
It got me thinking, well hey, how do I do?

I was a crazy dancing fool, I didn't socialize,
Yes, and especially when I'm blue, I get mobilised,
Well I was feeling uptight, I was at it all night,
Got me thinking, well hey, what did I think I was doing?

By the morning I knew, I had a number like you,
Got me thinking, well hey, what do you do when you want to go down to the shops?

I was a-wondering what to do, I'm on holiday,
Then it a-came out of the blue, I get mummified,
Well I was feeling so blind, I was wasting no time,
Got me thinking, well hey, what do you do when you want to go out and you've got too much time on your hands?
