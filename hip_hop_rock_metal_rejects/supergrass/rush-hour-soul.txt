Rush Hour Soul
Written by Supergrass

What you wanna say that's in my code
See you later for the rush hour soul
Took it all, now I feel like god
It's tripping out my soul

There's something I feel inside
But still I'm foul
And I would know it when it comes
Like a comet drifts to the sun
That's the way I feel
Can't ignore it when it comes

Little later with a sweet left hook
You look so good now I'm lying on the floor
Feeling better now I've been knocked out
It's tripping out my soul

There's something I feel inside
But still I'm foul
And I would know it when it comes
Like a comet drifts to the sun
That's the way I feel
Can't ignore it when it comes
