She's So Loose
Written by Supergrass

Take my love away,
It's never gonna work for you,

Well I met her at night,
You know that seeing is believing,
And though the feeling was right,
Well she couldn't stop screaming,
And she swallowed him down,
To the heart of the world,
She's so loose,
She's so loose,

Take these wings away,
They're never gonna work for me,

Well I met her at night,
You know that seeing is believing,
And though the feeling was right,
Well she couldn't stop screaming,
It's getting hotter again,
In the heart of the world,

Well he met her at night,
You know that seeing is believing,
And though the feeling was right,
Well she couldn't stop screaming,
And she swallowed him down,
To the heart of the world,
You know, she's so loose.
