I'm thinking of my soul's sovereignty, 
and I know everything you hate in me. 
Fill me up with over-pious badgerings, 
to throw them up, oh, one of my favorite things. 
Remember all the lessons fed to me 
Me the young sponge, so ready to agree. 
Years have gone; I recognize the walking dead, 
now aware that I'm alive and way ahead. 
Too bad the things that make you mad 
are my favorite things. 
And I'm so happy. 
I see you looking, I know that you're thinking 
that I'll never go anywhere. 
The things that I've done and the things 
that I've seen, I don't really expect you to care.
