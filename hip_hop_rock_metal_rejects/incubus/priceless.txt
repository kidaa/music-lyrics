The fact that you
You think you can
Speak to me
The way you do
It bleeds me to believe that you
Have never stepped out of the skin you lived within

And then, and if
This day occurs
Your tongue, the taste
Will imitate a battery
The anti-equilibrium
Your stomach becomes the floor

The look on your face was priceless!
The look on your face was priceless!
Yes, the look on your face was priceless!
That look, it was...

A light goes on upstairs, 
The attic is ablaze!
This island isn't big enough
For both of us so who will swim
In eel infested oceans?

Kiss the sand good-bye
because the tide is coming up and in
Yeah, water, water, water everywhere!
And every chance to sink!

The look on your face was priceless!
The look on your face was priceless!
Yes, the look on your face was priceless!
That look, it was so priceless

It's an amalgamation 
Of the things you aren't
The ways you wish you were
A split second
Perceiving of the way you really look to everyone of them

I wish that you could see because
I wish that you could see

The look on your face was priceless!
The look on your face was priceless!
Yes, the look on your face was priceless!
That look, it was so priceless
