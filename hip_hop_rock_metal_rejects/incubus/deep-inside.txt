It's 3 o'clock, 
and we ask ourselves, 
"Where are we now" 
It seems we've wondered out of bounds again! 
Over and over, we ask ourselves why we don't utilize 
things that are stored 
deep inside of our brains! 
I'm on my own and I can't see straight! 
Am I so stoned that I can't see straight 
Man, I've got to find my way back home, 
but I'm too deep inside 
It's 4 o'clock, 
and we ask ourselves, 
"Where did I go wrong 
We passed my house at least an hour ago!" 
Over and over, we ask ourselves why 
don't we utilize things 
that are stored deep inside of our brains! 
I'm on my own and I can't see straight 
Am I sooo stoned that I can't see straight 
It's 5 o'clock, 
and we ask ourselves, 
"We need to get home! The sun is creeping overhead again!" 
I'm way too deep inside to go home... 
I've got to get sane!
