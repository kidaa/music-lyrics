On the tip of my tongue an offensive is poised and rearing
My intention a bullet, my body a trigger finger

Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
I don't need to fear, fear you
Yeah, my pen is a Pistola

My secret arsenal is an infinite ageless inkwell
It's a fountain of youth and a patriot's weapon of choice

Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
I don't need to fear, fear you
Yeah, my pen is a Pistola

On the tip of my tongue an offensive is poised and rearing
My intention a bullet, my body a trigger finger

Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
I don't need to fear, fear you
Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
