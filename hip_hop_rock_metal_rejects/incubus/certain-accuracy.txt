Technology
Inventions that shine
Only hope and thoughts that reflects in our minds
Manmade machineries
Futuristic and advanced devices
Trying to get it right every time
Not accepting the pain of failure
When back to the starting point

CHORUS
A first
Second
And a third time
To create certain accuracy that is absurd

Creations that can bring us to an end
In different ways

Religion and politics
Are all overrated
Like many things in life
A human
Will never be able to control those situations
Whatever mankind does and builds to serve
And protect us might also send us to our grave

Our ways to fatal errors
With no turns back

With or without confidence
And also preparing for whatever might go wrong
Discovering is a hard task to force
And finding the solution is what instinctively
Does our race
Until the world reaches to a higher ground

With anxiety
Sorrow
And pain

Creations for both uses
To whom it may seem
That it can be right or wrong
Human imperfections and method of correction
A natural reaction
From the past until now days
An endless cycle that goes on

CHORUS
A first
Second
And a third time
To a certain accuracy that is absurd

In all the existing things in this world
Man will never achieve the degree of perfection
That they search for
