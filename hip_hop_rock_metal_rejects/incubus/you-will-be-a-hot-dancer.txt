Damn, this situation's new to me, why 
I see a head afraid to be himself, 
I bet he'd to have a little 
encouragement from the opposite, 
come that side of the floor...Yes! 
Egg him along, make him feel at ease with himself, 
steal his clothes, leave him his shoes, 
let's get this marmaduke naked! 
Makehim feel at ease, 
let's get this maraduke naked 
so lose your head and go to pieces..... 
Don't you make fun of me... 
don't you make fun of me! 
I'm gonna be, gonna be, 
I'm gonna be a hot dancer! 
Oohh... now that the basics are down, 
converse amongst yourselves. 
But, keep an eye out for the next complication. 
In other words, 
grab the next motherfucker marmaduke, 
who refuses to submit to these pelvic ostentations. 
I can't wait until the syllables bend. 
Let's get this marmaduke naked, 
let's get this marmaduke naked... 
so lose your head and go to pieces! 
Don't you make fun of me... 
don't you make fun of me! 
I'm gonna be, 
gonna be, 
I'm gonna be a hot dancer!
