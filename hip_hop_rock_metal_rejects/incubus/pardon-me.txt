Pardon me while I burst  
Pardon me while I burst  
A decade ago, I never thought I would be.  
A twenty three on the verge of spontaneous combustion. Woe-is-me  
But I guess that it comes with the territory.  
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity.  
I need you to hear. I need you to see.  
That I have had all I can take  
And exploding seems like a definite possibility  
To me  
So Pardon me while I burst into flames.  
I've had enough of the world, and its people's mindless games  
So Pardon me while I burn, and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me. I'll never be the same.  
Not, two days ago I was having a look in a book  
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees  
I said I can relate  
Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from.  
The burdens of the planet earth, like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D...  
And thinking so much differently.  
Pardon me while I burst into flames.  
I've had enough of the world, and it's people's mindless games  
Pardon me while I burn, and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me. I'll never be the same.  
Never be the same...yeah.  
Pardon me while I burst into flames.  
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me.  
So pardon me while I burst into flames.  
I've had enough of the world, and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn, and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me. I'll never be the same.  
Pardon me, never be the same. Yeah
