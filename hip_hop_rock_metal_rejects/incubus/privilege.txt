Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy 
Isn't it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore 
Maybe its me, but this line isn't going anywhere 
Maybe if we looked hard enough we could find a back door 
Find yourself a back door 
I see you in line dragging your feet 
You have my sympathy 
The day you were born you were born free 
That is your privilege 
Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me 
Doesn't have a clue why he's waiting or what he's waiting for 
Maybe its me but I'm sick of wasting energy 
Maybe if I look in my heart, I can find a back a door 
Find yourself a back door 
I see you in line dragging your feet 
You have my sympathy 
The day you were born you were born free 
That is your 
That is your privilege 
Find yourself a back door 
I see you in line dragging your feet 
You have my sympathy 
The day you were born you were born free 
That is your privilege 
I see you in line dragging your feet 
You have my sympathy 
The day you were born you were born free 
That is your 
That is your privilege
