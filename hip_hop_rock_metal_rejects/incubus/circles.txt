You saw me lost and treading water,
I looked pathetic,
I looked as helpless as a stinger without a bee.
But underneath my presentation, yeah.
I knew the walls were coming down
and the stones that fell were aiming away from me.

Hey!  What would it mean to you
to know that it'll come back around again
Hey!  Whatever it means to you,
know that everything moves in circles.

I saw you standing in my headlights. Blink, blink, blink.
I thought I'd run you down for the weight you left on me.
Instead I pushed rewind, reversed and drove away.
And seeing you disappear in my rearview brought to me the word 'Reciprocity!'

Hey!  What would it mean to you
to know that it'll come back around again
Hey!  Whatever it means to you,
know that everything moves in circles.

Round and round we go...
who could've known it'd end so well
We fall on and we fall off...
existential carousel.
