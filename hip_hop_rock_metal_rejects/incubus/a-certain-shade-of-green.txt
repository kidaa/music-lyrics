A certain shade of green, 
tell me, is that what you need 
All signs around say move ahead. 
Could someone please explain to me your ever present 
lack of speed 
Are your muscles bound by ropes 
Or do crutches cloud your day 
My sources say the road is clear, 
and street signs guide my way. 
Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D. 
What are you waiting for, 
A certain shade of green 
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate. 
What are you waiting for, 
A certain shade of green 
Would a written invitation 
signed, "Choose now or lose it all," 
sedate your hesitation 
Or inflame and make you stall 
You've been raised in limitation, 
but that glove never fit quite right. 
The time has come for hand-me-downs, 
choose anew, please evolve, 
take flight 
What are you waiting for 
A written invitation 
A public declaration 
A private consolation
