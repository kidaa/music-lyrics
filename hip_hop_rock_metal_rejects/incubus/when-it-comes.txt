It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again  
When it comes, it comes abrupt  
When it feels, it feels like trading brains with an imbecile  
For real  
Yes I feel emphatic about not being static  
And not buying philosophies that are sold to me, no, at a steal  
Just when you thought, it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy, and no  
What I'm looking for for  
Can not be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
Cuz what I want, and what I need, is and will always be free  
It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again  
When it comes, it comes announced  
And it feels like a matador is taunting me with his reddest red cloth  
And I am the bull  
Yes I feel emphatic about not being static  
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me  
Cuz now I'm full  
Just when you thought, it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy, and no  
What I'm looking for for  
Can not be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
Cuz what I want, and what I need, is and will always be free  
It's coming around again  
They're letting it out again, again
