About a hundred years ago now, 
thought I was left for dead. 
Soliloquy, she was my... 
A picture, a wake, 
my metaphoric friend. 
So then I fell in love with an irony named life, 
it taught me this from that and... 
a picture, a wake, you're gonna be hilikus. 
History has a tendency 
to block yout the popular beliefs 
about the leaders of the time, 
so glisten with my syllables and 
ponder the thought, 
maybe they should have 
had to dedicate more to it, go! 
You've got to be, 
so good to be, 
You've got to be HILIKUS! 
So I took a walk out side 
with my new found friend and the knowledge imbibe. 
I figured I'd find another 
with the same attitude, 
yes, then maybe I could talk 
to someone other than myself! 
The doors are swinging wide open, 
a positive attitude and the ilk in my pocket 
had a lot to do with my new found friend, 
the hilikus. 
History has a tendency 
to block out the popular beliefs 
about the leaders of the time, 
so glisten with my syllables and 
ponder the thought,

You've got to be, 
So good to be, 
You've got to be 
HILIKUS!
