Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear  
And I cant help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer  
It's driven me before, it seems to have a vague  
Haunting mass appeal  
Lately I'm beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there  
So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive  
Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive, oh oh  
It's driven me before, it seems to be the way  
That everyone else get around  
Lately, I'm beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there  
Would you choose water over wine  
Hold the wheel and drive  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there  
With open arms and open eyes yeah  
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there, I'll be there
