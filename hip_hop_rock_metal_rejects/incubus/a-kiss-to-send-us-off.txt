Meet me here
On November 11th, come alone
Bring your mouth 
and selective irreverence
We'll both see stars. Just...
One more tongue kiss before
the sky it falls
out from this cloud we're
hovering on!
A kiss to send us off! A kiss to send us off! A kiss to send us off!
Kill your doubt
With the coldest of weapons; confidence
No more words
Just the sound of resplendent
tongues colliding
One more tongue kiss before
the sky it falls out from this cloud we're
hovering on!
A kiss to send us off! A kiss to send us off! A kiss to send us off!
Here I am
There you are
On the wire connecting our hearts
There's a string, that is tied, to a kite.
There's a storm, in the sky
Now the clouds become electric
There you are
Here I am
Could I...
Have a...
kiss to send us off? A kiss to send us off! A kiss to send us off! A kiss to send us off!
