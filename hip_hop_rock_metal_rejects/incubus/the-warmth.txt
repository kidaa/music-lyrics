I'd like to close my eyes and go numb  
But there's a cold wind coming from  
The top of the highest high rise today  
Its not a breeze cuz it blows hard  
Yes and it wants me to discard the  
The humanity I know, watched the warmth blow away  
So don't let the world bring you down  
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold  
Remember why you came and while you're alive  
Experience the warmth before you grow old  
So do you think I should adhere  
To that pressing new frontier  
And leave in my wake, a trail of fear  
Should I hold my head up high  
And throw a wrench and spokes by  
I'm leaving the air behind me clear  
So don't let the world bring you down  
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold  
Remember why you came and while you're alive  
Experience the warmth before you grow old  
So don't let the world bring you down  
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold  
Remember why you came and while you're alive  
Experience the warmth before you grow old  
Before you grow old
