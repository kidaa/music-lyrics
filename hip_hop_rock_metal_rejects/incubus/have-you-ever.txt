To get up and walk away would be too easy.
So stay and stand your ground, just watch your mouth with me.
On the back of every right, there's a wrong looming.
So here you and I should tread as soft as these razor blades for boots will let be.

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes!
Have you ever tried to balance that beam!
And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes,
They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed.

Thought!
Unabashed honesty would be ideal,
But a prophet did once say that honesty is a lonely word.
So where do we go from here...  Abandon ship now
My problem is you made me melt and I don't want to be frozen anymore.

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes!
Have you ever tried to balance that beam!
And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes,
They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed.

Have you ever...  Have you ever tried to
I have never...  I have never tried to.

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes!
Will you ever try to balance that beam!
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes,
They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed.
