If it's good to complicate then both of us are doing fine.
Just leave your eyes on your part and leave me alone to mine.
If it's good to instigate then we're a fast horse, bet on us.
I'm not calling oyu an animal;I think we just fight too much.
Hey now, in spite of this we're doing just fine
Even diamonds start as coal.
Give us time to shine,
Even diamonds start as coal.
We're both aligned in framed of mind
But circumstance has got us good.
And now you're seeing a side of me I
Wished no one every would.
Yeah, if it's right to pick a fight, we're 
Fingers in a sugar bowl.
Love isn't perfect, even diamonds start as coal.
COme on, in spite of this we're doing just fine
Even diamonds start as coal.
Give us time to shine,
Even diamonds start as coal.
Even diamonds start as coal.
We're incomplete and infantine
Even diamonds start as coal.
Give it time girl, the fire feels divine
The sweetest things, they burn before they shine.
We think way too much,
Look at us losing touch!
A promise is a promise until...
Yeah in spite of this we're doing just fine
Even diamonds start as coal.
Give us time to shine,
Even diamonds start as coal.
Even diamonds start as coal.
We're incomplete and infantine
Even diamonds start as coal.
