We could live in a house outside of town,
we could build our own version of society,
well...there'd be no one to answer to and complicate our lives,
we could be the opitome of self sufficience.
Time to pay! To Pay! Time to pay; you've got to pay me!
Why should I
Why should we pay for your mistake To carry on.
Why should we carry on your false integrity
When you've shown us that you can't even keep your nest clean.
So far we've put financial gain ahead of human needs,
quality of our lives should be prioritized.
Time to pay! To Pay! Time to pay; you've got to pay me!
Why should I
Why should we pay for your mistake To carry on.
Modify your version so we can carry on. To carry on.
To be conclusive, I'd like to say,
you've done a super-fine job with your display.
I see now that you cannot comprehend what it means
to respect your life and then some!
To be rich, that would be great.
No, but it doesn't mean POO-POO without your nest!
So why should I pay for your mistake, man
Why should I
Why should we pay for your mistake To carry on.
Modify your version so we can carry on. To carry on.
