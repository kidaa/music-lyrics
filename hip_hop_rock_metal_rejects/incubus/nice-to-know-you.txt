Better than watching Gellar bending silver spoons.
Better than witnessing new born nebulaes in bloom.
She who sees from 'up-high' smiles and surely sings.
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings.

I haven't felt the way I feel today
in so long it's hard for me to specify.
I'm beginning to notice how much this feels like a waking limb...
pins and needles,
nice to know you,
goodbye!

Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go.
And higher than the heights of what we often think we know.
Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees.
To obtain a 'bird's eye' is to turn a blizzard into a breeze.

I haven't felt the way I feel today
in so long it's hard for me to specify.
I'm beginning to notice how much this feels like a waking limb...
pins and needles,
nice to know you...
goodbye!

So could it be that it has been there all along
