Today, everything was fine fine fine  
Until roundabout quarter to 9, suddenly I found myself in a bind, a bind  
Was it something I said  
Something I read  
And manifest that's getting you down  
Don't you dare come to bed with that ambiguous look in your eye  
I'd sooner sleep by an open fire and wake up fried  
Say what u will  
Say what u mean  
No, you could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean, clean  
Tomorrow, what price will I pay  
Could I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed, would you then give me the time of day  
I need a map of your head, translated into english so I can learn to not make you frown  
Feel better if you vent, put your frustrations into four letter words and let them out on mine  
The most weathered ears in town!  
Say what u will  
Say what u mean  
No, you could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean  
Clean [x6]  
Say what u will  
Say what u mean  
No, you could never offend  
Your dirt words come out clean  
Say what u will  
Say what u mean  
No, you could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean, clean
