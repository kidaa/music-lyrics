Will I ever get to, to where it is that I am going  
Will I ever follow through with what I... with what I have planned  
I guess it's possible, that I have been a bit distracted  
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand.  
In demand.  
Will I ever get to where I'm going  
If I do will I know when I'm there  
If the wind blew me in the right direction. Yeah  
Would I even care  
I would.  
I take a look around, it's evident the scene has changed.  
And there are times when I feel improved, improved upon the past.  
And there are times when I can't seem to understand at all.  
And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere really fucking fast.  
Nowhere fast.  
Will I ever get to where I'm going

If the wind blew me in the right direction. Yeah

I would.  
I would.
