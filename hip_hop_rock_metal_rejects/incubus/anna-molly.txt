A cloud hangs over, 
It's a city by the sea, 
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be, 
Out there and sober as a well for loneliness, 
Please do persist girl its time we met and made, a mess 

I picture your face in the back of my eyes, 
A fire in the attic a proof of prize, 
Anomaly, anomaly, anomaly...
Doo doo doo doo do doo doo doo doo doo

A cloud hangs over, 
And mutes my happiness, 
A thousand ships couldnt send me back from distress, 
Wish you were here, 
I'm a wounded satellite, 
I need you now put me back together make me right 

I picture your face in the back of my eyes a fire in the attic a proof of the prize, 
Anomaly, anomaly, anomaly 
I'll crawl to your name, 
I'll bend to the earth, 
Nobody else will ever compare, 
Anomaly, anomaly 

Wait there is a light, 
There is a fire illuminated attic, 
Fate or something better I could care less, 
Just stay with me a while, 
Wait there is a light, there is a fire defragmenting the attic, 
Fate or something better I could care less, 
Just stay with me a while

I picture your face in the back of my eyes a fire in the attic a proof of the prize,
