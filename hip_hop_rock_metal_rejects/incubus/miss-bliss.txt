I've seen a place not far away.
Where people are individuals.
And every car has a phone.
They'll bend backwards just to hear you say,
 I've got a new 'Rolls' so why can't I take you home 
Enough with their materialism and anal retentive state of mind.
All you need is yourself and a cause so the truth will be all that you will find.
What
Save me!
God
Save me!
You dress to impress and intimidate.
All in hopes that you'll catch a glimpse of a star.
Your guard is up and I see right through you.
Those credit cards and your make-up have gone too far!
Enough with their materialism and anal retentive state of mind.
All you need is yourself and a cause so the truth will be all that you will find...
Why can't I...dismiss my own vibe
Please help me....piss miss bliss away!
I look and I...see your fucking face!
Smiles kept by a...hidden will to live!!!!!
You can't see!!!
What your cheap mind game has done for me!
