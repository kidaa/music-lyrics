I'm home alone tonight. 
Full moon illuminates my room, and sends my mind aflight. 
I think I was dreaming up some thoughts that were seemingly 
possible...with you. 
So I call you on the tin can phone. 
We rendezvous at a quarter-two, and make sure we're alone. 
I may have found a way for you and I to finally fly free. 
When we get there, we're gonna go far away. 
Making sure to laugh; while we experience anti-gravity. 
For years, I kept to myself. 
Now potentialities are bound, and sleeping under my shelf. 
Simply choose your destination from the diamond canopy, 
and we'll be there. 
So I call you on the tin can phone. 
We rendezvous at a quarter-two, and make sure we're alone. 
I may have found the way for you and I to finally be free
