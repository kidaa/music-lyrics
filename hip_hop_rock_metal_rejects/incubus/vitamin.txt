I'm born 
I'm alive 
I breathe 
In a moment or two I realize, 
that the sphere upon which I reside, 
is asleep on its feet. 
should I go back to sleep 
We orbit the sun 
I grow up 
my open eyes see... 
A zombified, somnambulist society. 
Leaving us as vitamins 
for the hibernating human animal. 
Do you see what I mean 
You stare at me like a vitamin 
On the surface you hate, 
but you know you need me. 
I'll come dressed as any pill you deem fit. 
Whatever helps you swallow truth 
all the more easily. 
And I wonder, will you digest me 
Into the sleep machine I won't plug in, 
in fact I'd rather die before I will comply. 
To you, my friend, 
I write the reason I still live, 
'cause in my mind it's set the vitamin is ripe to give 
Coming closer to another 2000 years 
you and I will pry 
the closed eye of the sleep machine
