What if your brain, 
unexpectedly and suddenly, 
picked out things to flip around 
and view a lot differently 
What if blue sky, 
all of a sudden turned a purple hue 
We would shit a brick the size of all of it... 
what if 
What if I was just daydreaming 
What if I lived in a pear 
What if my watch read 4:20 every hour, every day 
You can bet your dollar I'd be happy! 
I forgot to remember; 
I forgot to remember my pain. 
Take me to your leader 
or die by the fly guy! 
What if mothballs, 
hangin' around too close to microwaves 
suddenly woke up and said, 
"Take me to your leader 
or die by fly guy! 
He'll push ya' out, 
no wings attached!" 
Just do as I say, no mistake, 
he'll blow away. 
What if I was daydreaming 
What if I lived in a pear 
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber 
tied to my leg and I 
did not want my pants to get dirty 
What if this, what if that! 
Go! I forgot to remember; 
I forgot to remember my pain. 
Take me to your leader 
or die by the fly guy! 
I forgot to remember my...PAIN! 
My pain! 
Forgot to inject my...cocaine! 
Forgot to apply my...rogaine! 
Forgot to remember...my pain! 
I never think, I never thought, 
oh maybe I'm insane! 
I think I like being 
way the fuck out of my brain! 
I forgot to remember; 
I forgot to remember my pain. 
Take me to your leader 
or die by the fly guy!
