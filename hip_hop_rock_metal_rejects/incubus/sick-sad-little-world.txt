No, You're not the first to fall apart
But always the first one to complain
You better get careful or you'll compromise everything You are

The world is a drought when out of love
Please come back to us
You're all of the above
I'm making a choice to be out of touch
Leave me be he said

Leave me here in my stark raving sick sad little world

I've never had unpaid confidantes
It's more than I would care to explain
But I have an open door policy when it comes to blame

The world is a joke when out of love
Please come back to us
You're all of the above
I'm making a choice to be out of touch
Leave me be he said

Leave me here in my stark raving sick sad little world
