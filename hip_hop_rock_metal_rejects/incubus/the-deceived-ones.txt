Bowing down to an angel cast out by god 
Worshipping a deceitful enemy 
Who's laughing at their pride in following him 

Considering everyone to be merely human pigs 
Under his cunning and evil eyes 

[Chorus:]
A multitude is in total chaos 
Knowing not the deceived ones that they are 

Asking for power, richness and desire 
The price that they must pay 
Is their souls thrown into a cauldron of fire 

By being weak and blind 
The fools disrespect the Christian houses of god 
They are the opposite of all that is holy 
Locked in cages of sins 
How can they reject the creator of all living things 

The almighty god hears the prayers from holy priests 
And Christians alike, forgiveness for them is at hand 
But curses shall fall upon those that refuse to repent 

[Lead, Lead] 

God's only begotten son was scourged, mocked and put 
To death and resurrected on the third day 
Proved his powers to demonstrate 
How goodness always prevails 

Followers of damnation march on in their darkest ways 
Falling to see and admit the truth tha christ left for us today 

[Repeat chorus]
