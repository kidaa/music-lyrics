To resist is to piss in the wind, anyone who does will end up smelling 
Knowing this why do I defy 
Cuz my inner voice is yelling 
There is a fist pressing against, anyone who thinks something compelling 
Our intuit we're taught to deny 
And our soul we're told is for selling 
Get out from under them 
Resist and multiply 
Get out from under precipice 
And see the sky 
Get out from under them 
Resist, unlearn, defy 
Get out from under precipice 
And see the sky

See the sky see the sky 
See the sky see the sky 
See the sky see the sky
