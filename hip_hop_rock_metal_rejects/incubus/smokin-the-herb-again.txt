Smoking
We're smoking, we're smoking the herb again 
We're smoking, we're smoking, we're smoking the herb again 
We're smoking, we're smoking, we're smoking the herb again

Damn, I really wish I could find my sack man 
Must have got eaten by Pac-Man 
If I had it I could smoke again 
Smoke with my friends to the very end 
But now I'm trying to comprehend 
When's the next time that I'll smoke again 
I need to know, please tell when will we smoke again 

I got a buddy, his name is Ted 
He's got a problem going through his head 
He doesn't know how to puff puff give 
But I like so I'll teach him and I'll let him live 
Everyday we teach him right 
When he defies, we have to fight 
But at the end of the trying day 
We says it's ok and we puff away 

Just the other night, I saw you, you were smokin not sharing and being tight 
But that's ok, you are my friend, we'll smoking until the very end 
The lessons that we put out, we order you to try it out 
It's nice to smoke, yea that's what we're all about

We're smoking, we're smoking, we're smoking the herb again
