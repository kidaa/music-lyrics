Two people touching lips
Hands on each other's hips
Nothing else in the world but one another

The 42nd floor
On a distant shore
I wonder how we strayed so far from this

Remember when we were
Just flesh and bone. You sir,
May have forgotten how good your world could be

So, put down your hollow tips
And kiss your lovers lips
And know that fate is what you make of it

Please end this [x2]
Before it ends us
Ends us [x2]

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside
For good [x8]

I read the news today
And everything they say
Just makes me want to stay inside

And a better part of me knows
That waiting in the throes
Is all on par with reading with my eyes closed

"What Can I do?", You say
It's just another day
In the life of Apes with ego trips

Put down your hollow tips
And kiss your lover's lips
And know that fate is what we make of it

Please end this [x2]
Before it ends us
Ends us [x2]

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside
For good

I'm gonna stay inside
I'm gonna stay inside for good
I'm gona stay inside
For Good

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside
Don't want to stay inside for good
For good [x10]
