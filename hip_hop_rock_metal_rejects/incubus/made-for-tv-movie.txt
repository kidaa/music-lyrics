I heard a word from on high
Glare like a light in the sky
It said, "quit blowing each other up"

A voicing so crystaline clear
Something's unclean in your ear
When only blood fills your cup

Hello
I'm trying to focus, but my eyes decieve me
Focus
I'm witnessing history repeating

It fell like a tear from my eye
Flying machines so up high
Well, there goes the neighborhood

A scene set to singe innocence
Upheave, unhinge, and pit against
Like every made for TV movie should

Hello
I'm trying to focus, but my eyes decieve me
Focus
I'm witnessing history repeating

Focus, Focus
Focus I can see now

We are, we know, we see, we think for you
The who, the what, the when, the where, the why
We build your young, we build you too, we see you all

Hello
I'm trying to focus, but my eyes decieve me
Focus
I'm witnessing history repeating
