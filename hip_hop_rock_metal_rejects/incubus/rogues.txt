I'm keeping an eye on the future
An eye on the past
And the present in my pocket
Just in case I need a door...
Into a brave new world
Where all solutions end up with my head
Buried to my neck in sand.
Enough, enough bowing down to disillusion!
Hats off and applause to Rogues and Evolution!
The ripple effect is too good not to mention
If you're not affected then you're not paying attention!
It's too good, too good, not to have an effect.
I'm keeping an eye on the pulse
An ear to the track and
Penance in a locket
I'm dropping from the highest floor
When it hits the ground
I watch it smash to pieces
Songs of liberation
Echo from the dust
The dust 
Enough, enough bowing down to disillusion!
Hats off and applause to Rogues and Evolution!
The ripple effect is too good not to mention
If you're not affected then you're not paying attention!
It's too good, too good, not to have an effect!
Enough,Enough,Enough,Enough,Enough!
Enough, enough bowing down to disillusion!
Hats off and applause to Rogues and Revolution!
The ripple effect is too good not to mention
If you're not affected then you're not paying attention!
It's too good, too good, too good...yes.
