Ok...now the monster is awake
It won't rest until there's nothing left
Maybe ever and anon
I forget about the pain
Someone bending light comes along
and flowers lean towards the sun
Some people fall in love and touch the sky
Some people fall in love and find Quicksand
I hover somewhere in between...I swear...
I can't make up my mind
