Nice car
Where'd you get your ride?
A trophy? Badge of honor? Overcompensation?
Price tags advertise your pride
Since when did what we pay for colored cloth gauge our gravity?

Yeah you got your little world
Picture perfect, its a pearl
Now go and try and sleep in the bed you made

You should be careful what you wish for
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside
You should be careful what you wish for
Cause all of what amounts becomes you

Nice watch
Man, you got the time?
Theres never enough and it always goes too slow
