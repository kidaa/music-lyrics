You don't listen
You just talk
Always catch a ride
And never have to walk
You try to teach me things I don't understand 	by myself
Awww you're something else
But I can't slow you down
All you ever do is mow 'em down
Mow 'em down

I brought you love
In the palm of your hand
You threw it in my face and didn't understand
I'm broken down and can't stand up
And nothing left in my loving cup
No
Ahh but I can't turn you around
All you ever do it mow 'em down
Mow 'em down
Now

You don't listen
You just talk
Always catch a ride
And never have to walk
You try to teach me things I don't understand 	by myself
Awww you're something else
But I can't call you a clown
All you ever do is mow 'em down
Mow 'em down
