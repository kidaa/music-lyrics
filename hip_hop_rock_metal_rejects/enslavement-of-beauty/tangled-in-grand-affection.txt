There's something in the air
There's something in the air

I know, I know, your love is like the ocean
I know, for sure, your head is in the clouds, my love
Oh I know, your love, is like a sweet devotion
Baby, baby tell me, tell me, what's love is all about

There's something in the air
Oh b-b-baby, your love is so unfair
Oh b-b-baby, there's something in the air, something in the air
Baby but your love is crazy, baby, I don't care

There's something in the air tonight
Baby but your love will make it always right
Baby there is something in the air tonight
Oh I can feel it

There's something in the air
There's something in the air

I know we make a night, we will remember, oh no
I know we turn the night in million days, my love
I know, for sure, it like summer in December
Baby, baby, nobody knows where is the perfect way

There's something in the air
There's something in the air
There's something in the air
