A shot in the dark I woke up to find
You had broke all the rules
And you changed your mind
Didn't I love you good
Didn't I love you right
Then tell me where are you going
Dressed to kill tonight
Oh this one's gonna hurt like hell

Answer my prayer and answer the phone
Think twice about it honey
Turn around and come on home
Lover stop lover don't
Lover stop
Lover lover please

It's the same old tune
I have sung before
It's the same old game
It's just a different score
If there was just one thing
I could call my own
It would be your love
That's sinking like a stone
Oh this one's gonna hurt like hell

And they hold you like I want to
And they give you what I want to
And they take it like I want to
And they make it and they break it
Why must you reject me
Why can't you protect me
