Neckbone or backbone neckbone or back
You got no fiction if you've got no fact

Neckbone or backbone your choice for the breakin'
You're thinkin' for a minute your choice might be takin' mistaken
For some good or some bad
You see what you got

There ain't no difference in the left, right
There ain't no difference in the blind, sight
Now stop for a minute 'cause your head is gettin' spastic
Paper or plastic-paper or plastic

Situation no win is the sin
So you rush for a change but the change has just always been the same
Same fools still trippin' off some old ways
New fools just thinkin' about some better days

Transparent, apparently you let it all pass
A kick in the head a kick in the ass
It's all the same to me

Fire or freezin'
Dried up or bleeding
Just when it's over you get what you're needing too much or no time
Shut up it's all mine and I let it go like that 

Neckbone or backbone neckbone or back
You got no fiction if you got no fact

Kobeyashi maru what you gonna do
Am I gettin' through
Am I gettin' through

Five triple zero
Yes you are no hero
You stop and wait, and why
Oh where, Oh where, Oh where can I be
You must understand that the world is crazy it's not for me

This is combat rock for the masses
But you know I fear the masses need to get their asses kicked, quick!
Step on up...
