12:32 just in time before we go
Race cars fast but cool yeah they walk slow
Blood from your nose better believe'll get ya messy
Yeah I tell no lie I direct it like Scorcese
No speed limit check it out down on that street
The soundtrack is live garaunteed with a phat beat
Gotta be like that if ya' want satisfaction
And if they ask ya' what, tell'em file under action

Flames in hollywood will get you good as human road kill
Thirty stories down take a fly off the window sill
You wanna kick some ass and get it on just like James Bond
The closest you can get is fuckin' it up in some rock song
Dressed at the show with a crude decapitation
'cause an oprah show, the trend is sweeping the nation

It's gotta be like that if you want satisfaction
And if they ask you what, tell 'em file under action
Gotta file under action
Gotta file under action

Go mind for mind Sugar Ray versus Durant
Got the hands of stone they'll knock you out yeah cause that is the plan
High speed chase on the tracks of the subway
Get the jewels, get the money, yeah 'cause this is the dog day
Now the reign of truth just like a game of rollerball
Nothin' clears your head like ninety miles an hour into a brick wall

It's gotta be like that if you want satisfaction
And if they ask you what, tell 'em file under action
Gotta file under action
Gotta file under action
Gotta file under action
