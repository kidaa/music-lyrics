want to be everybody
wish that i wasn't me
was dropped from out of sight
was bit by the bug, grew 47 feet tall
wasn't who i thought i was
wasn't anything at all

i want to be everybody 
i wish i wasn't me
i'm the bones of the dead 
superhero trustee
not seven minutes have past 
and everybody got blasted
operate annihilate and everything is alright...

OPERATE, ANNIHILATE!
what you got, you got too late, cause everybody's gone

i want to be everyone
i wish i wasn't me
the point furthest from is from a point of view less likely
you were the king of the moon
now you just lie in the dirt
where is the fist of fury
now everybody get hust

i want to be everybody
i wish i wasn't me
the real truth is in the head of truth is insanity
not seven minutes have past 
and everybody got blasted
operate annihilate and everything is alright...
