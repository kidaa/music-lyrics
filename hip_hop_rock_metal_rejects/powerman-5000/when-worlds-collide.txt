what is it really that is going on here,
you've got the system for total control 
so is there anybody out there, 
now watch us suffer, cause we can't go
what is it really that is in your head, 
what little life that you had just died
i'm gonna be the one that's taking over,
now this is what it's like when worlds collide ...

are you ready to go - cause i'm ready to go - what you gonna do  baby - baby 
are you going with me - cause i'm going with you - it's the end of all time

what is it really that motivates you, the need to fly or this fear to stop 
i'll go along for the ride but surprise, when we get there is say 9 of 10 drop 
now who's the light and who is the devil, you can't decide so i'll be your guide
and one by one they will be hand chosen, 
now this is what it's like when worlds collide ...

are you ready to go - cause i'm ready to go - what you gonna do  baby - baby 
are you going with me - cause i'm going with you - it's the end of all time

what is it really when they're falling over, 
everything that you thought was denied 
i'm gonna be the one that's takin over, 
now this is what it's like when worlds collide
