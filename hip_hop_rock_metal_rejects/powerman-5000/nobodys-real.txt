Scary monsters and super peeps
the more you dream the less you sleep
life as you know it has gone away
unbound, unwound, who's here to stay
Could you predict, could you foresee artificial by necessity
rockets and robots can save your life when you don't care about what's real it's alright

nobody's real but they're willing to let you know
nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight
nobody's real but they're willing to let you go
nobody's real but they'll feel it

nobody's real

how do you sleep with the time that's left you, 
it's all been done there's no need for the rescue
so let's just get out, i swear there's no doubt, 
you can't be ready cause there's nothing left to do...
