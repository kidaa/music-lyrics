blast off, blast off to nowhere
blast off ... this time to go
blast off, blast off to nowhere
blast off ... are you really what you think so

please just kill me now 
or get me off this rock
cause i can't stand to see your faces
and i can't stand to hear you talk

blast off, blast off to nowhere
blast off ... this time to go
blast off, blast off to nowhere
blast off ... are you really what you think so

prepared for anything
case this time is for real
burn the souls of those left behind
and i don't care how you feel
cause it's time...
to blast OFF
