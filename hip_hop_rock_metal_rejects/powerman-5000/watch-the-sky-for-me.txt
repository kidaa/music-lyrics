watch the sky for me
watch the night
i'll be there for you
in starlight
as you feet touch the ground
i'll be floating along

watch the sky for me 

tonight

just as every moment leads you to the past
just as everything has gone
i'm the one you need
to know that there is someone else
just as this is now

goodbye
