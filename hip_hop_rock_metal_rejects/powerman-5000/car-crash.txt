Red, the color the lines the road 225 the fearless explode
Who burns rubber from coast to coast supernova gets burned like toast

Gasoline blood fire veins honk Kong flu rides soul train
Concrete breakfast, star struck fame first place 
killer the man with no name,

Machine shop rodeo the scrap pile boss, 
you're the one who's gonna learn about loss
Eyes on the road souls in the gutter burn up the 
street just like the toe cutter

Don't be foolish don't go insane dead man's curve, 
ride the inside lane
Concrete breakfast, star struck fame first place killer
