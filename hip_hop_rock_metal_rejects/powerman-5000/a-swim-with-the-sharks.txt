You get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing
Well a swim with the sharks is like me

I'll find them for three and catch them and kill them for ten
When they smile just cut off your legs
You've got no time to think only to beg

Twenty no twenty five - three tons
The one in the front is the one on the run
Well it's blood red
Fair game for the eats 'cause this my home this is my street

Well is a swim with the sharks like weak is for strong
Nobody knows it yet not right from wrong
Deep is the dark from the depths of the dive
Am I okay, am I alive
Well the hot house now seems like suckin' on some ice cream
Funny thing is it'll make a grown man scream
Want to stay afloat but don't forget it
All I've got to say you're gonna need a bigger boat

Well a swim with the sharks is like now
never
deadly
clever
the darkness
the sun...forever...done
