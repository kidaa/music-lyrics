I know a man-his face is like plastic
Stretch smile wide, it's elastic
I know a girl she can fill up a room
1200 pounds, footsteps of doom
I know a machine man he's X-51
Harder than steel-his fists they're
Like machine guns
I know a guy bend a fork with his mind
The three-eyed baby, she is not blind

From mud hut to skyscraper in the
wink of an eye
Back again just as fast
Public menace, freak, human fly

I know the rat boy he does the rat dance
Born with a tail
He had to cut a hole in his pants
I know the slug of the slime of the
Slug of the worm man
Couldn't walk a step, but he
Dreamed that he ran
I know the skeleton girl she'll play
A song on her bones
Creak the high notes and rattle
Those low tones

From mud hut to skyscraper in the
wink of an eye
Back again just as fast
Public menace, freak, human fly

Dollar a look!
Dollar a look!
Dollar a look!
Dollar a look!
