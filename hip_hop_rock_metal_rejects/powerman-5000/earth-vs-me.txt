That's the way it's gotta be
The earth Vs. Me

Tales of an ordinary madness
Who's to blame, I mean for all
The sadness could it be the
Enemy within or just them
I blame them who is the one
That's kickin' your ass
Who is the one that's on your
Back Stabbin' the soul twister
Turn your miss into a mystery, I see
That's the way it's gotta be
The earth Vs. Me
Well, I can dig it yeah I'll rise
Above it all
Never, never, never takin' the fall

Well the thoughts that I think
Are paranoid
The thoughts that I think I
Think I can't avoid
I swear they're out to get me,
But get me not 'cause I'm ready
For the fight see
Trapped in a conscious state
Of mind of separation
Stickin' to kickin' the facts
From the songs of Alienation

Stickin' to kickin' the facts
Stickin' to kickin' the facts
Stickin' to kickin' the facts
From the songs of Alienation
Some people were meant to be
Left alone so step off

Step one - dehumanize
Step two - is when you realize
Step three - humiliate
Step Four - recreate
