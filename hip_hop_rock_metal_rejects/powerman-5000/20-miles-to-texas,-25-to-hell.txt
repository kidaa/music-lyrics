20 miles to Texas, 25 to Hell
Where the weather's hotter I could never tell
Spend most of my days doing nothing but no good
Seems like I was born to be misunderstood

20 miles to Texas!! 25 to Hell!!    
20 miles to Texas, 25 to Hell

I was born for stealing I wasn't made to sell
Carved out of bone and ash, steel, dirt, concrete
An arm for an arm a leg for a leg
One dead end street

20 miles to Texas!! 25 to Hell!! Fire's on the side of the road people toe to toe
Warm your hands on burning blood
I gotta go... go!!    
20 miles to Texas, 25 to Hell

If she ever loved me, I could never tell
Spend most of my days doing nothing but no good
Seems like I was born to be misunderstood
