the trip is on for a million miles, 93 to the sun
take your place and you say good-bye

it's automatic, it's automatic
it's automatic, your the one
it's automatic, it's automatic
your day alive has just begun

what's in the air, who's in the mind, 
where's the light in your eye
within the realm of the possible, 
it's no big surprise

it's automatic, it's automatic
it's automatic, your the one
it's automatic, it's automatic
your day alive has just begun

brilliant sheep lead to brilliant babies,
a thousand stars a million maybes
captivating the captivated, 
save the souls of those that you have created
