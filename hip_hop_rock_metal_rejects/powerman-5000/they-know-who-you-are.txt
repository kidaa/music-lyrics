gone for a moment that you'll never know
all of these things you can't control

they know who you are!!
they know who you are!!
they know who you are!!
they know who you are!!

gone for a moment that you'll never know
all of these things that you can't control
the lights from above they move in real slow
giving you things that you'll never know

they know who you are!!
they know who you are!!
they know who you are!!
they know who you are!!

one for machines that fill up the sky
and one for the demon that lights up you eye
they know who you are!!
