Sometimes I Scream, Sometimes I Cry
Sometimes I Just Lie In Illusion
Siome Nights I Shake, Some Nights I Sweat
Some Nights I'm Just Wet With Confusion

Chorus:
Don't Do This, Don't Do That
Don't Look Back, You Might Stumble
Don't Say Yes, Don't Say No
Don't Let Go Or You'll Tumble Down

Some Days I Kick, Some Days I Bite
Some Days I Must Fight The Reaction
Soemtimes I Win, Sometimes I Lose
Sometimes I'm Just Bruised By The Action

Repeat Chorus:

Bridge:
Now You Have The Power To Destroy
Clockwork People Just Like Clockwork Toys

Middle 8
Don't Try To Tell Me Your Fantasy
It's My Life
You Try To Tell Me What's Right For Me
Turn The Knife, Twist The Key
