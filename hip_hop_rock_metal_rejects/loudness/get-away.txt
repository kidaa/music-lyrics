Get Away, I'm Warnin' You
Get Away, I'm Tellin' You
Watch What You Say
On The Danger Way

Get Away, Let's Shaek It
Get Away, Let's Break It
Ani't Safe To Play
On The Danger Way

Without Concrete, You'd Be Lost
Without Hot Wheels, You'd Be Lost
Without Chain Link, You'd Be Lost
Without Cold Steel, You'd Be Lost

Chorus:
Don't Look Back, Run For Cover
Save Yourself, Save Your Lover
Overkill, Undercover
Hit And Run At Midnight

Get Away, Stop Losin'
Get Away, I'm Cruisin'
Every Day
On The Danger Way

Get Away, Go Faster
Get Away, Disaster
Ricochet
Off Dange Way

Without Shadows, You Cold Die
Withou Leather, You Could Die
Without Fighting, You Could Die
Without Switchblades, You Could Die
