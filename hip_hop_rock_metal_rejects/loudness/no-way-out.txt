Lost In The Underground, Lookin' Gor Daylight
Afraid Of Darkness And Surrounded By The Night
Screaming, I Shout, There's No Way Out

You Said Goodbye So Cold, I Stood In Wonder
Shocked By The Silence, Shakin' By Thunder
Screaming, I Shout, There's No Way Out

Chorus:
I Ask Questions And You Tell Me Lies
Try To Make You But I'm Hypnotized
Am I Over You, I Got My Doubts
I've Tried Everything, There's No Way Out

I Walk The Streets At Night, I Hear Your Laughter
The Voices In My Head, They Don't Mind, I Don't Matter
Screaming, I Shout, There's No Wy Out

Watching The Hours Crack, Still Hae That Feelin'
Darkness Attacks The Wall, I Hit The Ceiling
Screaming, I Shout, There's No Way Out

Repeat Chorus:

Bridge:
You Got Your Vain Excuses, I Got My Anger
One Fight, Guess Who Loses
That's What Tortures Me
