So Many Times I've Been Lost
And Blinded By The Light
Caught Up In A Maze
Now I Feel Just Like A Wolf
Who Forgot How To Fight
And Frozen By The Haze

I Was A Hungry Mean Beast
I Would Never Be Satisfeid
Always Looking For The Next Feast
Waiting For The Next Ride

Chorus:
Like Hell, I'm Gonna Do It. Like Hell
Like Hell, I'm Gonna Rock You , Like Hell
Like Hell, I'm Comin' At You, Like Hell
Like Hell, I'm Gonna Shock You, Like Hell

Just One More Sip To Ease My Thirst
Another For The Fire
That's All That I Need
The Time Has Come To Break The Spell
Or Give In To Desire
There Ain't No In Between

No I Won't Stay And Take It
Get Caught Up Standing Still
Looking For A Way To Shake It
Looking For The Kill

Repeat Chorus.

No More Hiding In The Shadows
Runnin' From The Fight
No More Cryin' When The Wind Blows
Howling At The Night
