Take In The Frozen Dawn
No Way Out Still Holding On
Empty Hands, Full Of Pain
Reaching For The Rain

Let Me Go Now
No Where To Run
Under The Gun

Chorus:
Run For Your Life
Run From The Fire
Want To Survive
Run For Your Life

Nothing But The Night Exists
Dak Divides The Cold Wet Mist
Trapped In Time, With No Way Out
Can't You Hear Me Shout

Let Me Go Now
Open The Cell
I Can't Take This Hell
