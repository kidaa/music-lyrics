Got A New Hair Style I See
You Dress To Kill
Bright Colored Lipstick For Me
Against My Will

Please Don't Go Changin'
You're Gonna Change Your Mind
Please Never Change Your Mind

I Look At You, Head To Toe
But It Don't Seem Right
All This Fashion For Show
Happened Over Night

I Got Your Number 
It' Only Changin' Times
Please Never Change Your Mind

Chorus:
Hear Me When I'm Sayin'
How My Love Grows
Given Time And A Chance, You'll See
Things Are Always Changin'
That's How Love Goes
Don't Go Changin' A Thing For Me
