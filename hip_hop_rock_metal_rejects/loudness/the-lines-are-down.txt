You Cry, Darkness Listens
You Hide, Sudden Sorrow Fights At You
Black And Blue
When Fever Builds Inside You
Your Body Shivers Hot And Cold At Night
Hold On Tight

You Know The Power's Out, You Can't Leave
Now That Your Heart Is Pounding Energy

Shattered, Afraid To Show It
Don't Let The Crazy Madness Pull You In
Fight To Win
Looks Like Your Life Is Crashing
You're On The Razor's Edge, It's Hard Ot Know
Don't Let Go

The Night Is Blowing Cold, You Can't Leave
Twisted By Silence And The Agony

Chorus:
Lines Are Down Everywhere
Something's Under The Stairs

Middle 8
Lines Are Down The Razor's Edge
Cry For Me

You Cry, Darkness Listens
You Hide, Sudden Sorrow Fights At You
Break No Through
Lights Out, Someone's Watching
Lookin' For The Images To Cut And Run
Load You Gun

One Shot, Squeeze The Trigger, Make Them Leave
Left In The Night, The Only Enemy
