Sometimes the wicked ones
 the mortal sting
I am the only one
Across the dreary plane
I am watching
Across the crucified
So few are chosen
I do not die
 horrified
And seat yourself a ride
Get out of your denial
A genius of the night
And I am watching
Across the crucified
So few are chosen
I do not die
In the hands of death
Burn baby burn
In the hands of death
Burn baby burn
In the hands of death
Burn baby burn
They creep and crawl inside
Into the heart of cold
So dead and paralyzed
Perversion of the soul
I am watching
Across the crucified
So few are chosen
I do not die
In the hands of death
Burn baby burn
In the hands of death
Burn baby burn
In the hands of death
Burn baby burn
