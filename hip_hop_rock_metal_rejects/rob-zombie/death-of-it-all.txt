See the famouse lung girl,
They call her Helen Lyle,
Life's a respirator when you got the sinner style,

She float out on the midway,
She wrangle at the show,
Life's a revelation wherever you go,

[Chorus]
Together we fly,
Together we fall,
Together we all see,
The Death Of It All,

See what's in the trailer,
Count up all the holes,
Bullets and the movies never tell the whole,

Now Clyde was a lover,
And Bonnie was a queen,
They set their sights for Texas and never left the scene,

[Chorus]

See the horrifying,
Beast behind the bars,
Watch the transformation the monster is a star,

Out steps a beauty,
Now watch her walk away,
Another grand illusion if you wanna pay,

[Chorus x2]
