It has no motives, No limits, It can't hurt, Can it? See what it is.

I tried to see the one that's free,
Now it's gone,
I tried to hear the one that's near,
Move along,
I tried to feel the one that's real,
Is it wrong?
I tried to take to one that makes,
Now it's gone,

Innocent and wounded, baby,
Educated Horses, baby,
Distant kings surrounding, baby,
Imitation of life, baby,

RIDE!
Dirty, sweet, and filthy,
RIDE!
Beat your hands on me,

This is where the ghosts hide,
Now it's gone,
This is where the truth lies,
Move along,
This is where the dirt flies,
Is it wrong?
Up against the mud skies,
Now it's gone,

Innocent and wounded, baby,
Educated Horses, baby,
Distant kings surrounding, baby,
Imitation of life, baby,

RIDE!
Dirty, sweet, and filthy,
RIDE!
Beat your hands on me,

RIDE!
Dirty, sweet, and filthy,
RIDE!
Beat your hands on me,
