Hell on Earth
For What It's Worth
Dead on Dreaming
You started screaming
The wizard of how
The king of the now
Cry like a banshee
And die like you want me 

Violator
Desecrator
Turn around and meet the hater
Violator
Desecrator
Turn around and 

Demonoid Phenomenon
Get it out
Get it on
Demonoid Phenomenon
Get it out
Get it on 

The conquering worm
The slithering germ
Lost in black sleep
I see how the gods weep
The horror of Madness
The Terminal Sadness
The cool air of mourning
Gave me the warning 

Violator
Desecrator
Turn around and meet the hater
Violator
Desecrator
Turn around and 

Demonoid Phenomenon
Get it out
Get it on
Demonoid Phenomenon
Get it out
Get it on
