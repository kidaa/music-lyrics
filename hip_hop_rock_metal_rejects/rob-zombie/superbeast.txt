Shriek the lips
Across ragged tongue,
Convulsing together.Sing
violently, Move the jaw
Cry aloud. Bound up the Dead
Triumphantly 

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see. 

Hey, Yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, Yeah - I'm your Superbeast
Hey, Yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, Yeah - I'm your Superbeast 

Stir the limbs across the wrist,
Full possession of memory.
Bury me as a dog, 
Icy hands surrounding me. 

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see. 

Hey, Yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, Yeah - I'm your Superbeast
Hey, Yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, Yeah - I'm your Superbeast 

Shriek the lips
Across ragged tongue,
Convulsing together.Sing
violently, Move the jaw
Cry aloud. Bound up the Dead
Triumphantly 

The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
You pray so hard on bloody knees.
The ragged they come and
The ragged they kill!
Down in the cool air I can see. 

Hey, Yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, Yeah - I'm your Superbeast
Hey, Yeah - I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, Yeah - I'm your Superbeast
