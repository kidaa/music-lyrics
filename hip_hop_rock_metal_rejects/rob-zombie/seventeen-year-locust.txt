Electric black nite crash,
Hunger on your face,
Opium heat rash,
Suffocate this place,

Well I see the sun,
Burning in your eye,
I see the sun,
Call a suicide Come on,

17 Year Locust
If not now when? [x4]

Tombstone eyes roam,
Up and down your skin,
Assasinate the mindframe,
Nothing left to win,

Well I see the sun,
Burning in your eye,
I see the sun,
Call a suicide Come on,

17 Year Locust
If not now when? [x4]

Enchanted on the highway,
All the freaks collide,
One minute longer,
You start the slide,

Well, I ain't the one
Burning in your eye,
Well, I ain't the one,
Call a suicide Come on,

17 Year Locust
If not now when? [x4]
