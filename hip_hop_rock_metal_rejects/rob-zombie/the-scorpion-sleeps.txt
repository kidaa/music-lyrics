Yeah,
Yeah,

Midnight candy four cups of coffee,
I ate my breakfast with a side of eggs,
I saw something in the jungle,
Low in gear - black mudd on my legs,

She was something stretch before me,
Her arms into wings into pillbox heads,
Can the side show - wherever you go,
Two naked figures in my breath,

Can you see it?
If you feel it,
The Scorpion Sleeps right in my hand,
A poison dealer,
An evil wheeler,
How can I make you understand?

Yeah alright - Said it's alright - Yeah alright

A blue light shindig - Well I'm addicted,
Killing black kettle is what they saw,
I feel like something in the congo,
Dead were the women not the warriors,

Last great road show - A canvas tilt go,
Arms into wings into pillbox heads,
Creep the high-go and keep the down low,
Into the mind of a melting man,

Can you see it?
If you feel it,
The Scorpion Sleeps right in my hand,
A poison dealer,
An evil wheeler,
How can I make you understand?

Yeah alright - Said it's alright - Yeah alright

Can you see it?
If you feel it,
The Scorpion Sleeps right in my hand,
A poison dealer,
An evil wheeler,
How can I make you understand?

Yeah alright - Said it's alright - Yeah alright
