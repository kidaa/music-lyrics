what is the purpose
demonoid phenomenon
regulate the flux and reflux
so bring it on
loose upon the world
destruct a juggernaut

suddenly the rats are high
bleed the masses and watch'em cry
slumber like houdini's dog
die alone out in the fog

iron head- regenerate
iron head-exterminate
iron head-liberate and crucify you

what is my name
demonoid phenomenon
laugh in your face and
break because you dont belong
vent apon the brink
appear another demi-god

suddenly forever knows
what it takes and where it goes
paint it black inside your head
i defy what you have said
