[Crowd Chants:] Zombie! Zombie! Zombie! Zombie!

I speak the truth,
I dare not tell a lie,
One child is in fits,
The other child dies,
Now the yellow bird sits upon her finger,
The yellow bird a specter lost to linger,

God Hates - The Lords of Salem,
No can ever save them,
God Hates - The Lords of Salem,
No one can destroy them,

Do you think they suffered,
Up on Gallows Hill?
Burn me and hang me,
And I always will,
Tumble like a swine,
A victim of the fury,
Glory to the saint,
Before you start to bury,

God Hates - The Lords of Salem,
No can ever save them,
God Hates - The Lords of Salem,
No one can destroy them,

God Hates - The Lords of Salem,
No can ever save them,
God Hates - The Lords of Salem,
No one can destroy them,
