He who gets slapped and he who gets saved,
He who brutalizes the timeless stage.
He is the mongrel, he wants it all,
He lives for relics, hang on the wall.

Foxy, Foxy, what's it gonna be?
Foxy, Foxy, what's it gonna be? 
Foxy, Foxy, what's it gonna be?
Foxy, Foxy, what's it gonna be?

She who looks back, and she looks away,
She internalizes the motion wave.
She is the butcher,
She wants the air,
She hides the scars under her hair.
