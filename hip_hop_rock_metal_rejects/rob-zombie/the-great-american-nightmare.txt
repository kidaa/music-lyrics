Dig deep down from Planet X, yeah
Thirteen ghosts in the devil's head
Step right up and feel the fire
Hardcore love of the never dead 

Call me the American nightmare
Call me the American dream
Call me your soul corrupted
Call me everything you need 

Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, who do you love
Yeah, motherfucker
Who do you love, yeah 

Black boots stomp and penetrate, yeah
Lust and death gone in your head
Rat pack mind degenerated
Thirteen ghosts sing the body red 

Call me the dark intruder
Call me the haunted sea
Call me your Monster Zero
Call me anything you need 

Call me the American Nightmare
Call me the American dream
Call me your soul corrupted
Call me everything you need 

Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, who do you love
Yeah, motherfucker
Who do you love, yeah 

Call me the American Nightmare
Call me the American dream
Call me your soul corrupted
Call me everything you need
