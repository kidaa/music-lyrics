I went out walking to Crippletown
My crutch hit the floor with a boney sound
Now all the girls go beep beep beep
How can I love whne you're so cheap

Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Don't be long, Don't be long, Don't be long

Bring her down, Bring her down,
Bring her down, see the wonders around you baby

Now everybody gather in the square
To twist their fingers in my hair
They hang around like a serpentine
And try to speak like Frankenstein

The children come all dressed in black
One foot forward the other back
They splash around in a muddy hole
While everybody crying they got no soul
