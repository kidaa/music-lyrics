Rettke
When the fire is over 
and you're down on the ground
you are searching the daylight
but it just can't be found
what's the sence of this madness
yu don't know those rules
war is only a game
for the ruling fools
Come on and fight 
you've got to feel
hard as a rock,cold as the steel
don't kill this world, it's the only place
to live in harmony for the human race
Chorus:
Hunting the tyrants}-x4
we need no sirens
again and again we have to fight for our love
We don't need no protection
for the future at all
no atomic reaction
for our lives to fall
just believe in tomorrow
put your love in the air
please don't drive us to sorrow
if you want to be fair
