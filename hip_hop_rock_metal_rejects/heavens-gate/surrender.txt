Rettke/Bilski
Face to face and eye to eye
guess I'm leaving this town forever
want to break free from those old lies
we were living too long together
Just can't stand it or face more of the same
I've got the choice to stay or to leave
watching our dreams go down the drain
saying goodbye to what I believed
Defences were down, you were willin' to go 
anywhere but now that the future is over,say
you never cared
Chorus:
I surrender
Never coming back
I surrender
never looking back
I'm not down and I'm breaking these chains
taking some time to watch the sunrise
life will never be the same
once I know it's been a matter of lies
It's taking me high
I'm leaving this town,yes,I'm free now
I'm leaving,I'm watching the sky
