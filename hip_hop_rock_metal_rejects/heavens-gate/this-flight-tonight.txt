Joni Mitchell
Look out the left,captain said
the lights down there,that's were we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
above the Las Vegas sands
it wasn't the one that you gave to me
that night down south between the trailer
not the earthly one
that you can wish upon
not the northern one
Chorus:
Oh,starbright,starbright
you've got the loving that I like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
but you've got that look so critical
I can't talk to you baby
I get so weak
sometimes I think love is just mythical
up there's a heaven
down there's a town
blackness everywhere and little lights shine
blackness,blackness dragging me down
come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine
Chorus.
I'm drinking sweet champagne
got the headphones up high
can't numb you out
can't drum you out of my mind
they're playin' "Goodbye,baby,baby,goodbye
ooh,ooh,love is blind"
up to the flaps, down to the wheels 
I hope you got your heat turned on baby 
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again
Chorus.
