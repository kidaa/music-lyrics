You think you have the right suspicion
each move you make is in control
you won't believe, it's like a vision
What do you feel? Is this the price you'll pay?
some say the heal,they guide your steps in other ways
Chorus:
#:[In control]
See that it's real
# it's a dirty nightmare #
The world is changing face and body
corruted minds are gaining ground
if you won't change it,they'll have the glory
Try to beware from now to eternity
wake up and watch those cold blue eyes and died blonde hair
You're waiting for the last command
to destroy your promised land
the mighty will be satisfied
when you've killed your fellows right
Don't make no strangers of body and soul
feel all the danger,you're under control
breaking the grip,making no differernce at all
fight for the rights of all colours you call
