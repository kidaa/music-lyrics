Rettke/Bilski
Drivin' down the avenue and you hear that downtown melody
standin' in that city heat and you know that's your destiny
Feel the sound,watch the blood red lights
now your veins feel the power and you're hypnotized
Chorus:
#:[Hot fever]
you've got that downtown love
# it's burning inside out #
Sound is firing up your blood and your body makes a powerdrive
you believe in metal gods if you feel that mental overdrive
For your minds it's a losing game
and your eyes are hot like a burning flame
