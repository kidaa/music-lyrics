Toxic waste corrupts the air
adulteration of man's breath
the sky pours forth rains of acid 
waters of life now bring death
Clear cuts expose the land
forest ravaged by greed
corporate lies behind bought 
destruction for profit their creed
Surrounded by nonpoint filth
pollution's silent killer
ignoring our earth's decline
out of sight,out of mind
Established upon the deep
founded upon the seas 
the earth become infected
from the fall came its disease
Pollution corrupts your soul
wake up from your careless sleep
open your eyes to see 
what you sow you'll surely reap
Psalm,24:2; Revelation 16:15; Galatians 6:7
