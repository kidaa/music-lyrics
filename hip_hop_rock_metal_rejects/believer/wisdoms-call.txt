How long will you simple minds love your simple ways
and continue to reject the calling of wisdom
fools mock at making amends for sin
you fools detest turning from evil
Does not wisdom cry aloud does not understanding raise your voice?
the wise attaining wisdom and discipline listen and add to their learning
Worth more  than silver yields more than gold
nothing you desire can compare with her
those who find her through Christ find life
all those who hate her love death 
Why don't you open up your mind 
can't you hear wisdom's cry?
Proverbs,1:2,5,20-22; 3:13,14; 8:1,9,35-36; 13:19; 14:9
