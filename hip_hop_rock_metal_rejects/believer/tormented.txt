K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft
When evil men advance to devour my flesh, 
When enemies attack, their will to oppress. 
When bloody wars break loose and armies draw near, 
in the day of distress my heart will not fear. 
Chorus: 
"PAIN, MENTAL torment, 
SAVED from DEATH." 
Trapped in mental pain, agony within, 
life consumed by anguish, endurance wearing thin. 
Tormented by misery, struggling to stand, 
growing weak with sorrow, my grief is in Your hands. 
Chorus: 
Struck down but not destroyed, You lift me from the depths, 
You brought me from the grave, redemption from death. 
Hard pressed on evry side but not in despair, 
never on my own, Your presence everywhere. 
Psalm 30, 31, 2 Corinthians 4:8
