Movement I: The Lie
The fruit from the tree was so 
pleasing to my eye. The serpent 
said that I would not die. 
The serpent shall be cursed, he 
will crawl about and eat dust. 
I will put enmity between the 
woman and you. Man will crush 
your head, you will strike his heel. 
The wisdom of the world will be 
mine if I eat. What can it hurt 
if I take it and eat? 
I will greatly increase the woman's 
pain, when bearing children all of 
your days. You will desire man. 
He will rule over you. 
Take some, man. Gain wisdom, too. 
Eat from the tree. 
It's what you must do. 
The land will be cursed because of man. 
Producing thorns to make him bleed. 
By your sweat you will live until death. 
Dust you are and to dust you will return. 
Gen. 3:1
Movement II: The Truth
Then Jesus was lead by the Spirit into 
the desert to be tempted by the Devil. 
After fasting 40 days and 40 nights, He 
was hungry. The Tempter came to Him 
and said... 
If you're the son of God, tell these 
stones to become bread. 
Man does not live on bread, but by 
words from the mouth of God. 
If you're the son of God, throw 
yourself to the ground. 
God will save you. 
But it is written; do not put your 
God to the test. 
All the world I give you. If you bow 
and worship me. 
Leave me now and worship the Lord 
your God. Serve Him only. 
When Satan left Him there the 
angels came to Him. 
Temptation lost. 
Matthew 4:1-11
Movement III: The Key
Evil scheming, wicked violence, 
and such is the end of all with ill 
gotten gain. 
Hatred rejection, mocking others, 
this takes the lives of those with ill 
gotten gain. 
Do not walk on paths of the wicked. 
They are the darkness and they 
don't understand. 
The path of the righteous first 
dawns, gleaming, shining brighter 
'till the full light of day. 
Do not offer body to sin. 
Offer yourselves to God as those 
brought to life. 
Therefore put on the armor of God, 
so when that day of evil comes, you 
can stand your ground. 
Pr. 1:19, 4:14-19 Ro. 6:13 Ep.6:13-14
