K. Bachman/J. Daub/J. Winters
I feel fine now. The past is gone. 
The book reads my name. I've been 
issued a new life. 
Stupidity flows, the more you speak 
insanity grows, the more I think 
religious ideals, cross parallels 
Static thought, swallowing me 
Crippled mind, all I am is gone 
reality fades, time rules my life 
kaleidoscopic days, lost within cries 
confusion consumes, broken, I bleed 
Static thoughts, swallowing me 
Broken wing, horrific dream 
Crippled mind, all I am is gone 
Rev.20:12
