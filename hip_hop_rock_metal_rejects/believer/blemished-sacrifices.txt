K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft
Living a lie, waiting to die, drowning your soul in sin. 
Moral decay, you will pay, injecting the venom within. 
Hiding your sorrows, running away, destroying the Spirit's shrine. 
Wasting your life, unbearable strife, the drug infests your mind. 
Chorus: 
"Going nowhere, living nightmare. 
Endless falling, He is calling." 
Ice cold, you sit in fear, your body weakens inside. 
Lethal dose, invading you, you're running out of time. 
Blackest night closing in, ripping you to the core. 
Suicide, the terminal lie, yet eternal life can be yours. 
Evil defied, escape the lie, misery freed within. 
Spirit control leading your soul, victory from what has been. 
Gaining wisdom, growing in strength, attaining dependence on Christ, 
Forgiven sins, life through Him, He was the sacrifice.
