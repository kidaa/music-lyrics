K. Bachman/J. Daub/J. Winters
I. Living proof of what can be, 
escaping from life's tragedy 
learning through another's mind, 
to catch a glimpse beyond the skies 
II. Mental rush of abstract pain, 
never asking what's to gain 
never lost in splintered eyes 
focused on what inward lies 
Return to me, I'll return to you 
I will not change to justify you 
III. Living proof of what must be, 
broken from the misery 
never lost in present time, 
always seeking future mind 
Return to me, I'll return to you 
I will not change to justify you 
Mat. 7:3, Malachi 3:6-7
