Dreamers enticed to turn away
kneeling to gods born from clay
praying to images carved of stone
bowing though sins are not atoned
Hearing only silence through your cries
seeing nothing with lifeless eyes
worthless are the objects idolized
blinded men fall to their demise
Unholy lovers of themselves
money the lust of which compels
brutal without self control
defying the redeemer of your soul
I am the fist and the last
Yahweh creator of ages past
ruler author of the book of life
fortress saviour of impending strife
"I am the lord
apart from me 
there is none
I form the light
of this dark world
bow to me or die"
