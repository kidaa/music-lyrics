What good would result for a man, 
by gaining the world but losing his soul? 
Love not the world, 
or the wrath of the Father you will behold. 
Do not conform to evil, 
the desires conceived in ignorance. 
Choosing to befriend the world, 
brings hatred from God as a consequence. 
Chorus: 
"DEATH, SIN, 
Extraction From Mortality. 
WORLDY REJECTION, 
deliverance from agony." 
Men would love you as their own, 
if you belonged to this earthly realm. 
Mankind hates the ones, 
who do not conform but rebel. 
Everyone born of God, 
will not face eternal decay. 
Death they will overcome, 
the ways of man will pass away. 
Be transformed by renewing, 
the intentions and thoughts of your mind. 
Your life must be hidden in Christ, 
leaving the corrupted flesh behind.
