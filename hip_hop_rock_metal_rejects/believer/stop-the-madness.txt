Just an ignorant child, 
brainwashed by this decaying world. 
Always searching to belong, 
endless fear of being alone. 
Line by line. 
I watch you die. 
Too blind to see, 
your shattered dreams. 
Weary from the boring routine, 
the dependency grows. 
Taught to listen to the wise, 
but only heard the fools. 
Body once unscarred, 
now being murdered by stupidity. 
Realization of the truth, 
brings freedom in captivity. 
John 14:6; John 8:32
