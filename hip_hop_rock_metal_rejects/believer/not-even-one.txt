No one is righteous, not even one, 
there is no one who understands. 
The Anointed One of God they shun. 
NO ONE. 
All born of the flesh have turned away, 
worthless together they have become. 
No one does what is right, all disobey. 
NO ONE. 
Chorus: 
"Blood sacrifice, faith had begun. 
No one must die, not even one." 
Their throats are open graves, 
their tongues practice deceit. 
Ruin and misery mark their ways. 
RUIN. 
The poison of vipers their lips outcry, 
their feet are switft to shed blood. 
There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
NO FEAR. 
A righteousness from God has been made known, 
through the faith one has in Jesus Christ. 
Believing that His shed blood will atone, 
OUR SINS. 
There is no difference for all have sinned, 
falling short of the glory of the Lord. 
But redemption comes from Christ within. 
BELIEVE. 
Romans 3:9-31
