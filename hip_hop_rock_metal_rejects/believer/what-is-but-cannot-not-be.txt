K. Bachman/J. Daub/J. Winters/D. Mann
I. Possibility cannot, 
account for actuality. 
Whatever can come to be, 
is caused in order to be. 
II. Nothing cannot be something. 
I am but can not be. 
My existence depends on, 
what is but cannot not be. 
III. Every effect has a cause, 
principle of causality. 
The existence of God is, 
theistic relativity. 
the God the heart needs, 
the mind only grieves
