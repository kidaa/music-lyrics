Rise up, so you can take a stand against the schemes of evil, 
courage, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. 
Struggle, not for flesh and blood but against dark forces, 
rulers and authorities of sin from the spiritual world. 
Attack, oppose the prince of death in the heavenly realms, 
power from the armor, you must stand your ground. 
chorus: 
"We will UNITE AS ONE, 
we'll stand and FIGHT AS ONE." 
Take up the potent shield of faith with which you can extinguish, 
flaming arrows of the one who seeks to slay the chosen. 
Uphold the double edged sword which is the Living Word, 
piercing unlike any other blade judging thoughts and actions. 
Weapons of divine power to destroy all strongholds. 
Fighting the good fight of faith intent on final conquest. 
Join us disciples of the light in this spiritual warfare, 
take hold of eternal life saving souls from hell. 
chorus: 
Romans 7:23, 8:37, 12:5, Ephesians 4:13, 6:12, 
Galatians 3:28, 1 Timothy 6:12, 2 Timothy 2:4
