I walked the hill  touched by wind  autumn leaves dancing round my feet
I stroke your hear  and blew away the dust  your pale and fading stare
where are you now?  I don't really care  you broke a lover's vow
I found the tree  our scratches in the rind
I tried to read mossy names unsigned  tiny letters hastily written down finally
blue turns grey - margins fray  but memories stay  images do remain
sentences stay the same  plans get disarranged  symbols changed
I hope you've lost all the shots  I hope you've torn them apart
I hope you've burned all the words  I wrote down - in believe
wish I could wipe out the trace  wish I could stop giving chase
guess I could wipe out the trace  guess I could stop giving chase
turning around myself for too long  I've lost what's going on
banning all what's left in a chamber  I feel fine  keeping my head above water
I survive  still too weak - to take your things, torn them apart
still too proud - to call your things great memories  who are you now?
I don't really care  where are you now?  I don't really care  I walked the hill
touched by wind  autumn leaves dancing round my feet
guess I could wipe out your trace  guess I could stop giving chase
turning around myself for too long  I've lsot what's going on
still too weak - to take your things, torn them apart
I'm looking forward to that day
still too proud - to call your things great memories
I deny don't want to glorify
kissed your lips - they had the taste of drying wax
badly surprised I turned away  shut the door - having just left the rack
seemed I had left the play  smelt your scent - it put a neelde in my heart
I wasn't ready for the fray
