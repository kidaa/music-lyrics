You have coffee when I have a pee
you start bitching about everything linked to me
on this record played for too many times
don't you think we've discussed in to the nines
I just turn a deaf ear to you  hold your tongue or tell me something new
I just turn a deaf ear to you  I'm wandering you're still around
stick to your guns or shut your mouth  I don't know why you're still with me
you neither do as far as I can see  bite back your speech
just fade out your voice  it makes me sick  ending is better than mending
and even you  - got the plan to make me someone new
- got the plan to make me someone new
and even you  - do not have the view to pull it through
- do not have the plan to pull it through
bite back your speech  just fade out your voice
it makes me sick  ending is better than mending
and even you  - got the plan to make me someone new
- got the plan to make me someone new
and even you  - do not have the view to pull it through
- pull it through, pull it through, pull it through
