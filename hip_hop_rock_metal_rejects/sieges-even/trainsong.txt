Rushing down platform 8, all my efforts are in vain
disappearing in the dark are the tail lights of the train
one minute too late - it was the cab drivers fault
now I've got to wait next to a pissed yob
"got any change?" - he's getting brash
I search my pockets for some cash while he's still talking trash
stand back on platform 8  next service will be late  please mind the doors
please mind the gap  passengers moving from B to A
going home or coming to town  who knows their journey route
different trains going on different rails  wheels are finding their way
spinning round without rest  heading from east to west
beds of sleepers go by  train delay - another service cancelled
six past nine - I won't arrive in time  I step inside the waiting room
it smells of sweat and pee and poo  I hope I'll find a place to rest
I cast a desperate view  my legs a tired - I'd like to get a seat
but noone seems to move his ass  so I remain on my feet
