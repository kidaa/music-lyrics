A new portrait in your frame  not finished yet - I hit the floor
trying to avoid in the distance lies deceit  your lips will not purge my sin
stains of wine and blood grow pale  vivid colours fade away
step by step taking the uneven path  slow down your pace, I need a rest
I'm tired of trying to reach the crest  side by side facing the turn-off
your life-line's straight but I need a map  give me a hint where to go
new episode in your soap  let time feed your desire
revision is dope; vision is hope  and the new ring puts on rust
your finger's to small  in my presence lies defeat
your collection's incomplete  other portraits to be seen
different actors on the screen  side by side reaching the turn-off
if you can't wait give me a hint  which direction I've to take
I have to find my own pace  can't march in step; I'll give you a smile
I will wave you goodbye  new episode in your soap  let time feed your desire
revision is done; vision is hope  step by step taking the uneven path
slow down your pace, I need a rest
