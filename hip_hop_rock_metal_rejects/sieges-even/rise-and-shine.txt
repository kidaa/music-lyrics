Nothing more left to be said  things get clear now in my head
u know what I feel  I know what is real  no more waiting for a sign
we both laid it on the line  there's no alibi  I have to face the sky
leaving your life - entering mine  I conclude the wintertime
stranded by the tide  I'll get by  gotta keep u out of my head
have to keep on forgetting what you said  accepting - gosh I hate the word
but I will  rampant weed won't obscure my way  while I rise and leave the shade
I turn over the page  have to take my thoughts from u
I need to get a different view  I'm leaving it behind  rise and shine
I cannot take it anymore  pleasant memories I've got to ignore
I'm coming back: it's my comeback  I'm leaving the old track  cut
gotta keep u out of my head  other contents I'll put in instead
the die is cast; trancent the past - moving on
rampant weed won't obscure my way  while I rise and leave the shade
I turn over the page  I cannot take it anymore
pleasant memories I've got to ignore  I'm coming back; it's my comeback
I'm leaving the old track  the clouds that had me blind and gone
my hands untied; the knots undone  I think I can make it now
yeah - I'm sure I'll make it now
