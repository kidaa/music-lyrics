Water is getting into my arch  diming out lights - until dark
thought my construction was tight  thought what I built up might stand the flood
stand the flood  phrases bearing a questionmark  are trying to board my barque
again I start thinking what could have been  what might have been
if I made up my mind in a different way  what could have been
if I made you stay  again I start thinking what do they mean
what do they mean  all these words like "but" and "if"  haunting my brain
what does it mean  when all the doubts come up again
remembering me: what should have been  what could have been
what if I've followed my vision  what if I've sat on the fence
if I took a different decision  if I felt a change of sense
too many things I can't change  too many setups I can't rearrange
too many unknown lamentos  I'm singing of key  should I've thought of myself
or of the pain inside  climbing up the ladder  I was put out of the stride
should I've tried harder  banish my doubts!  What do they mean
these words like "faith" and "love"  bereft of their meaning
when push comes to shove  what might have been
if I made up my mind in a different way  what might have been
if I made you stay  what might have been
