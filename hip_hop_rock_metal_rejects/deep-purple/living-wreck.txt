You came along for a weekend
But you only stayed for one night
You pulled off your hair, you took out your teeth
Oh I almost died of fright
You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes it's a shame
Ah you know you're a living wreck

You said you were a virgin
Full of promise and mystery
But I know that you would bring me down
'Cos everyone calls you Big G
You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes it's a shame
Ah you know you're a living wreck
