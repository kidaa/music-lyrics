Spread the word around, the rat is leaving town
The message is a song, the misery is gone
Once I had a dream to sing before the Queen
She didn't want to know, she wouldn't see the show
What a fright! I couldn't do it right! Oh what a night!

Mystic demons fly all about the sky
With memories of a clown, the saddest show in town
When I was seventeen my mother said to me
Be careful what you touch, you shouldn't take so much
I blew my mind, she was so kind, I could have cried

In my mind, I had to find 
A kind of new way of being oh so cool
Like a blue blooded well studded English fool

Speak about the past, times are changing fast
Once I was so weak, I couldn't even speak
Shaking out a curse, nothing could be worse
Walking through the door, who could ask for more
Now I'm free, and I can see, and I can see

Spread the word around, the rat is leaving town
The message is a song, the misery is gone
Shaking out a curse, nothing could be worse
Walking through the door, who could ask for more
Now i'm free, and I can see, and I can see

Please stay away
