Sweet child in time, you'll see the line
Line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying taking toll
If you been bad - Oh Lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit oh by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes aahouh bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
Ooh ooh ooh...
