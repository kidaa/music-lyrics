Well I stood under your bedroom window throwing up a brick
No one came, I threw one more, that really did the trick
Your daddy came and banged my head, he said what kind of man
Is this that's hanging 'round my girl ha threw me in the can
You're a farmer's daughter, you're a farmer's daughter
Why do I always get the kinda girl I didn't oughta get
I won't get no more eggs and water
Now I've laid the farmer's daughter

Imagine I was a full-grown man and I could talk just right
Could I come and see you here and do this every night
Wham! The door comes crashing down, your daddy's face all pale
Says come with me you hairy bum, I'll put you in my jail
You're a judge's daughter, you're a judge's daughter
Why do I always get the kinda girl I didn't oughta get
Now I'm getting jail and torture
'Cos I made the judge's daughter
Yes I did! It was nice!

It seems they're screaming law and order
When I go with anyone's daughter

Woman I should like some peace and daddy hold your tongue
I think you're gonna die of fright when I tell you what I've done
I can hear your tales and lies, you say I'm dumb and scraggy
But man this dumb and scraggy is your daughter's baby's daddy
She's a lucky daughter, such a lucky daughter
Why did I always get the kinda girl I didn't wanna get
Now I've got what I always fought for
'Cos I've married a rich man's daughter
Ha! What d'ya think of that
