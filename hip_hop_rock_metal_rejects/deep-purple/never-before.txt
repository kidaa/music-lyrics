Somebody, somebody come to my side
I'm tired, I'm crying, I'm sick inside
My woman, that woman just wasn't right

Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before

So funny, so funny, just like a show
One name, two people, all in a row-ouh
Somebody, somebody, someone must go

Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before

I was hurt when I was younger
By a woman who was cold-ouh
She took my name, she took my body
Then she threw away my soul

I can't hide, I can't hide my misery
I know my sorrow won't set me free
She did it, d'you see She did it to me

Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before
