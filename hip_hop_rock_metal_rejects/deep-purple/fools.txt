I'm crying - I'm dying

I can see what's wrong with me, it's in my head
I can't see what's gonna be as I lie in my bed
Man is not my brotherhood, I am of the dead
I died as I lived as I loved and was born on some distant hill
The reasons to hide were the reasons I cried
The fools pass laughing still

There can be bad blood in all and I can see it's in my brain
You don't know the pain i feel as I must live again
Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but tears will leave a stain
They smile to themselves as they lay down my head on some distant hill
The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye
Fools smile as they kill

I got my own way to go and now I want to take your minds
I believe if you could see the blood between the lines
I believe that you could be a better kind
Please lead the way so the unborn can play on some greener hill
Laugh as the flames eat their burning remains
Fools die laughing still
