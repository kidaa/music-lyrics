Black suede don't mean you're good for me
Black suede just brings your mystery
I want to be inside of you
But you're black and I don't know what to do
You're a smooth dancer but it's alright 'cos I'm a freelancer
And you can never break me though you try to make me think you're magical

Baby you're the one who can never see the sun
Because it don't shine nightly
Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free
You'd better hang on tightly
You wanna rule the world but you're acting like a girl
Who's got a false pregnancy
You've swollen up inside with nothing but your pride
And yet you keep on dancing

Black suede don't waste your time on me
Black suede I sense your mockery
I tried to go along with you
But you're black and I know just what to do
You're a smooth dancer but it's alright 'cos I'm a freelancer
And you can never take me though you try to make me think you're magical

I think you're crazy your two-timing ways 
They don't bother me none
You'd better do it right because one day or night 
I'm gonna walk to freedom
You know I loved you once and I wanna love again 
But you don't give nothing
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize 
Baby I ain't bluffing

Black suede don't waste your time on me
Black suede don't bring me misery
I tried to be inside of you
But you're black and now I know what to do
'Cos you're a smooth dancer but it's alright 'cos I'm a freelancer
And I can tell you're faking though you try to make me think you're magical

Baby you're the one who can never see the sun
Because it don't shine nightly
Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free
You'd better hang on tightly
You know I loved you once and I wanna love again
But you don't give nothing
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize
Baby I ain't bluffing

Baby you can rock'n'roll but you can never show your soul
Smooth dancer
Baby you can rock'n'roll but you can never show your soul
Smooth dancer
