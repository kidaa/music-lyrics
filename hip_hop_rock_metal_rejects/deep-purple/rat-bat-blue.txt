Hey baby what you gonna do
When the lights go up on you
What's your name Can I drive you home
Sweet woman, are you all alone
You're the one for me
I'm gonna keep you busy as a bee could be
Could be
Ooh! Rat ba-ba-bat blue
Wooh! Rat bat blue
Rat bat blue

Aoh! Get up! Woman, don't be slow! 
It's getting late and I wanna go
No cause for acting big - Got to love, got to live
Stick around with me 
I'm gonna show you things you never thought you'd see
You'll see
Ooh! Rat ba-ba-bat blue
You're so fine
Rat bat blue
Aaah... Mmmm!

Get up! You didn't understand
I'm a hard loving man
No way you can satisfy, the way you look, the way you lie
And when you shut the door 
Make sure I don't see you 'round here no more
No more
Ooh! Rat ba-ba-bat blue
Rat bat blue
Oooh! Rat bat blue
Oh oh ooh...
