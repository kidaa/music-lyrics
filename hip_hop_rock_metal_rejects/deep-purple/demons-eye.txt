I don't mind just what you say
I never heard you baby never heard you anyway yeah
I don't care what you do
Just so long yeah it ain't me and you
Sly, sly... Ouh like a demon's eye

Everything's good, I said everything's fine
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time
How does it feel to be turned away
I've known it baby almost every day
Sly, sly... Mmm like a demon's eye

I don't need you anymore
I don't want you baby hanging 'round my door
You slip and slide 'round my brain
You think you're so clever yeah but you know you're insane
Sly, sly... Like a demon's eye

I d-d-don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, I never heard you anyway, no I didn't
Everything's good, everything's fine
You don't know it's the end of your time yeah
Sly, sly... Like a demon's eye

Like a demon's eye oh oh yeah
You're so sly baby yeah oooh yeah...
