Somebody's shouting up at a mountain
Only my own words return
Nobody's up there, it's a deception 
When will I ever learn

I'm alone here with emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

Wondering blindly, how can they find me 
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking, anticipating
The call of the black footed crow-ouh

I'm alone here with emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And taunting with pictures of home

Here in this prison of my own making
Year after day I have grown
Into a herobut there's no worship
Where have they hidden my throne-ouh

I'm alone here with emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And screaming out pictures of home
