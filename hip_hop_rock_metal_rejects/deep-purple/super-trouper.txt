I was a young man when i died aah
I was a flash, I was full of pride ouh
I gave it all, I gave my soul
I was so strong, I felt the truth
I felt the pain in every song

How well you know me, you've seen me cry
I'm just a shadow in a rock and roll sky

I was living in a rock and roll sky auh
I was a king, heavy on the style ouh
Super trouper yes I know you well, making me shine
I couldn't see what you did to me, I was so blind

How well you know me, you've seen me cry
I'm just a shadow in a rock and roll sky

I wanna be like I was before aah
But this time I'm gonna know the score ouh
I need a home I can leave behind, knowing you're there
Super trouper I can see you now
Return your stare

How well you know me, you've seen me cry
I'm just a shadow in a rock and roll sky
