Thinking out of line just to make the sun shine anyway
I can be like you
Fighting with the truth
Trying to hide a fool in a fantasy
Ouh ouh oouh! I'm dreaming
Lay me down, lay me down... Take me now

Our lady, our lady, our lady of the skies

Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun... Reality
Aiming high at my dream
But I can get along, she makes me strong anyway
Ouh ouh oouh! I'm dreaming
And there is no other way

Our lady, our lady, our lady of the skies

Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity
I can hear your song
Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity
Ouh ouh oouh! I'm dreaming
Let me go, let me go

Our lady, our lady, our lady of the skies
