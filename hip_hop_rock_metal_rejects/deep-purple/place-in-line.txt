I am living in this line, know my place
Could think of no way of edging along in a loser's race
Oouoh line was moving slowly, day by night
Everybody's shuffling on to keep a place in the line
Place in the line

Nine long years been in line, gettin' nowhere
There is no reason for this line - He! He! I don't care
Oouoh everybody's standing in the burning sun
Everybody's shuffling on keeping a place in the line
Place in the line
Aaaah!

Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it now
We've got a place in line
We're gonna make some time somehow yeah

Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it now
We've got a place in line
We're gonna make some time somehow
Alright!
