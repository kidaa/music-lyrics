From the soundtrack Tommy 

Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball 
From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all 
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall 
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball 

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine 
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean 
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall 
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball 

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist 
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist 
How do you think he does it I don't know 
What makes him so good 

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes or bells 
Don't see lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell 
Always gets a replay, never seen him fall 
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball 

I thought I was the Bally table king 
But I just handed my pinball crown to him 

Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best 
His disciples lean him in and he just does the rest 
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall 
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
