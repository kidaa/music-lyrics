Lyrics by Tim Rice 
From the soundtrack "The Road To El Dorado" 

I hardly think I'm qualified 
To come across all sanctified 
I just don't cut it with the cherubim 
The town's already on it's knees 
Being worshipped is a breeze 
I barely know the words to any hymn 

Listen if we don't comply 
With the locals' wishes 
I can see is being sacrificed or stuffed 
Let's be Gods, the perks are great 
El Dorado on a plate 
Local feelings should not be rebuffed 

It's great to be a God 
Tread where mortals have not trod 
Be defied when really you're a sham 
Be an object of devotion 
Be the subject of psalms 
It's a terrifying notion 
All those prayers and thos salaams 
Any normal man would bridle if he's forced to be an idol 
And a normal man's exactly what I am 

All the same it's pretty clear 
The bastards don't keep much up here 
They must have zillions under lock and key 
But Gods can force then to unleash 
Enough to make us nouveau riche 
Beyond our wildest dreams so follow me 

Can't you see I won't relax 
If religious maniacs 
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime 
How can I be their belief 
When I'm lying through my teeth 
Why don't we just say some other time 

It's great to be a God 
But if you get the people's nod 
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice 
Be nirvana be salvation 
Be all things to all men 
Butter up your congregation 
Every Sunday score a ten 
All the alternative is dire 
Simply frying pan to fire 
So sign on two new Gods for paradise
