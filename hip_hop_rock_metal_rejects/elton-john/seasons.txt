Lyrics by Bernie Taupin 
From the soundtrack Friends 

For our world, the circle turns again 
Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change 
It's meant a lot to me to start anew 
Oh the winter's cold but I'm so warm with you 

Out there there's not a sound to be heard 
And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words 
As the waters freeze up with the summer's end 

Oh it's funny how young lovers start as friends 
Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friends
