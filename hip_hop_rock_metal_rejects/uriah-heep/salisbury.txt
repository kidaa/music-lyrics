Somewhere in your eyes that very special glow
Somthing's drawing me to where I do not know
I never realy thought that I would lose myself
But now I'm moving faster than anybody else
You move without a sound and touch me with your hand
Just like the rain that fondles every little grain of sand
This thing we gonna do is just for you and me
And I'm gonna make it good, good as it can be 
Your kiss is sweeter now your breath is getting warm
And we must take our time to make it last 'till dawn
I wonder will it be what,oh, I expected to
There have been other girls but no one else like you
I feel a power here I never felt before
And I begin to see what drives to want more
Oh girl of all my dreams, please tell me if I'm wrong
Because I believe that we belong

As time passed and all too fast
I just knew it couldn't last
And I guess that the end was near at last
Though we tried our love inside
It just whithered up and died
What went wrong I will never, never understand
You tell me why

Alone again, how could you leave me
Alone again, I don't wanna be alone again

There's a line in a rhyme
I was going to send to me
It says all that is to be will surely be
And so you wrote ,you had to go
'Cause you needed some one new
Is there still a chance
That you'll come back to me
I want you back you see
