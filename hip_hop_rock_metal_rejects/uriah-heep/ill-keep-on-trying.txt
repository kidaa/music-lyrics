Ah..................
You came to me
With all of your lies
And I was taking in so well 
It took me quite a time
To see the disguise
You made it very hard to tell

Now I hear you are again
But you're begging in vain
'Cause I really don't want to know

Ah...................
You came to me a little bit of charm
You had me down on my knees
I didn't really think there was any harm
But all you ever did was tease

You took all the love that I ever had to give
There was nothing left to show

Ah........................
Well I remember everything
Everything around me
The long dark winter 'till the breath of spring
Came close enough to drown me
So I'm gonnna keep on trying
Till I feel like dying
And I lay down and pass away

But that won't happen 'till tomorrow
And by then I can borrow
Another day

So I'm gonna keep on trying, yeah

You came to me a little bit of charm
You had me down on my knees
I didn't really think there was any harm
But all you ever did was tease

You took all the love that I ever had to give
There was nothing left to show

Ah................................
