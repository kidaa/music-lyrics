Greater than to face it, give me your money
Make my life sunny for a day
Road that leads to nowhere, please stop your crying
I ain't fit for dying this way 
Go steal another with your eye
Go try some other heartless lie

Now I have hope of speaking, bring back the moon
Don't play your silly games with me
Oh what a waste of daydream. What is your need
I'm gonna bleed until you pay

You've lost all sign of your direction
You're only looking for the next one
The next one to kill

Ashes of destruction spread out so far
Blackened nurses crying over me
See a one time city, now just a scar
Tears of the flower man fill the sea

Give me a chance to fly away
There's nothing here for me today
Today
