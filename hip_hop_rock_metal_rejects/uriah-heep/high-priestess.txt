You, who brought the sunshine to my eyes
You, who wander through my sad disguise
And I have a love that can not die - for you
High priestess of my heart
Tell me that we won't part 
Let us get together in the sky
Leave the lonely world to wonder why
For we have a love that can not die - So true
High priestess of my heart
Tell me that we won't part
