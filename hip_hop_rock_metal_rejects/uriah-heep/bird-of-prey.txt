I can see that look that says beware
You try to move in closer if you dare
So I will sit and play my waiting game
And for a while I know you'll do the same
Fly away 
Watches like an eagle from its tree
Then like a bird of prey she captured me
But I am older and more wise than you
Bird of prey - straight into me you flew
Oh No!

Now every time I try to set her free - Yeah! Ooh!
I'm glad to say she comes right back to me - Ah!
But if I knew she didn't want to stay - Yeah! Ooh Ah!
I wouldn't try to keep that lovely bird of prey - Ooh Ah!
Ooh Ah!
