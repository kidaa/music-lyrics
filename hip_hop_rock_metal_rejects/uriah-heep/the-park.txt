Let me walk a while alone
Upon the sacred rocks and sadness
Let me look in vain belief
Upon the beauty of each leaf 
There is green in evr'y place
The trees so .. in shade
Make us sing a happy song
All nature's strangers are around

And there's a horse that feels no pain
It's iron strength to take the strain
Children rock it to and fro
And gayly drink its colour glow

Ahahahah

Above the sky devoid of cloud
Think not to cast a thunder shroud
Upon this place so full of joy

So why my heavy heart you say
When tears would stain, a sight so gay
My brother's dream once here did soar
Until he died at the hand of needless war
