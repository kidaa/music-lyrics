Girl before you go now
There's one thing I wanted to do
Let's get to take you back
'Cause I want to make love to you 
Got me real turned on

But there is something in your eyes
Telling me you have to go
Something in your eyes
But you tryin' not to let it show

Got me real turned on

Next time you come over
I'll buy you a bottle of wine
Just take a little drink
And everything will turn out fine, yes it will
Oh babe do you know
What I have in mind
Can you guess wat it is
Or do you want it on the line

Got me real turned.. Got me real turned..Got me real turned..Got me real turned.......
On....
