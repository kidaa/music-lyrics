Wake up, set your sights
For never shall we fail
Stand up for your rights
And justice will prevail 
You're listening through endless nights
And decision is your goal
So wake up, set your sights
For the time is right for your own
Yeah for your own, yeah,yeah

Wake up, wake up, wake up, set your sights
Never ,never, never shall we fail
Stand up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Justice, justice, justice will prevail

There in the morning
Flying over the hills
While many are yawning
They're all crushed by our wheels
Never have I witnessed people in fear
Not like today, not in many a year
Go kill another, there are more close behind
No screams a another  are you of your mind
The way all shatterd pages don't seem to yield
Bodies are scattered there all part of the field
Oh no, did I tell you what would happen if you tried
Oh God stop this killing said the young man
Before he died

Wake up, set your sights
For never shall we fail
Stand up for your rights
And justice will prevail
