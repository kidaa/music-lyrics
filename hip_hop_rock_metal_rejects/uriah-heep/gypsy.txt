When I was only seventeen
I fell in love with a gypsy queen
She told me to hold on 
Her father was the leadin' man
He said you're not welcome on our land
Then, as a foe, he told me to go

Aaah

He took me to a little shack
And put a whip across my back
And told her leave me

I was out for quite a time
Came back with her on my mind
That sweet little girl
she means all the world

Aaah

Ya know I want my gypsy queen
Will she still be torn between
Her father and lover

One day I will go to him
Strong enough to fight and win
The kind of man
That he'll understand

Aaah
