I see you running
Don't know what you're running from
Nobody's coming
What d'you do that was so wrong
Look back and turn back, look at yourself
Don't be afraid just look at yourself
If you need assistance
Or if all you need is love
There's no point in hidin
Tell me what you're frightened of
You've got a friend, just look at yourself
Don't be afraid, just look at yourself
Look back and turn back, look at yourself
Don't be afraid, just look at yourself
