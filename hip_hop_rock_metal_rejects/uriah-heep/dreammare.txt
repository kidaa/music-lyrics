Greedy demons
Smiling sideways
Laughing in my face
Here within my troubled sleep
Is such a lonely place 
Running fast but never moving
I can't get away
Strange but realistic objects
Making me that way

Then it starts as fast as it came
Evil dream
Changing like the sun turns to rain
It would seem

La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la
Riding with the gods of beauty
On a distant shore
Tasting fruits of unknown sweetness
Never seen before

Dancing stars with crystal voices
Backing with their eyes
Unicorn of many colours
Rides to paradise

Then it's gone as fast as it came
Peacefull dream
Changing like the sun turns to rain
It would seem

La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la
Sleepless nighttime past the lighttime
Crucified my head
Dreams of peace and then disaster
Wish that I were dead

Looking for the end of darkness
Seeking out the day
Fallin' escape with sleep at bedtime
Bury me away

Then it starts as fast as it came
Evil dream
Changing like the sun turns to rain
It would seem

La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la
