I'm walking in your shadow
Ever since you went away
And the clock on the wall
Really hasn't very much to say 
For you left me bleeding
And left me needing
you

In so very many ways
I was trying to attract your mind
But I'm the lonely one
'Cause I had to leave it all behind

Lied and deceiving
Why should I be grieving
you

Ride on a golden wave
Set sail for the sun
Make every cloud your slave
Don't be alone

When I get back from trip of the ocean wall
Still walking in your shadow
And still looking for somewhere to hide

If I am worse off
It's all because of
you
