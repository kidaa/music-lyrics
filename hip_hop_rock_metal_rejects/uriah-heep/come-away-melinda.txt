Daddy, daddy, come and look! See what I have found!
a little ways away from here, while digging in the ground.
Come away Melinda.
Come in and close the door.
It's nothing, just a picture book
they had befor the war.

Daddy, daddy, come and see! Daddy come and look!
Why there's four or five little Melinda girls inside my picture book.
Come away Melinda.
Come in and close the door.
There were lots of little girls like you
before they had the war.

Oh daddy, daddy, come and see! Daddy hurry do!
Why there's someone in a pretty dress, she's all grown up like you.
Won't you tell me why
Come away Melinda.
Come in and close the door.
That someone is your mommy
you had before the war.

Daddy, daddy, tell me if you can.
Why can't things be the way they were before the war began
Come away Melinda.
Come in and close the door.
The answer lies in yesterday
before they had the war.
