Well the very first time
I saw you darling
Not one single word
Would come to my lips 
Yes the very first time
I saw you darling
Not one single words
Would come to my lips

I was so afraid you wouldn't love me
I wanna tell you right now
I was freightned by damned
To my fingertips

So baby when you went away
That unlucky day last September
I was like a little lost boy
In the wilderness

Baby, baby, baby when you went away
I was like a litlle lost boy
In the wilderness

And I've just been sitting and thinking
Of everybody I've ever known
Well you know I still love the very best
Yes, the very best
