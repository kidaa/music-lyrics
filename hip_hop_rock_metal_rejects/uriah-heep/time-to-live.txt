Let me see the sunshine. Let me feel the rain.
Let me go where I wanna go.
Well I want to smell the flowers, see the dawn again.
Find those friends I used to know.
Find those friends I used to know.

Well I spent twenty long years in a dirty old prison cell.
I never saw the light of day.
If you could understand, oh that kind of living hell.
That's the price I had to pay. Oh yeah!
That's the price I had to pay.

They say I killed a man, but I never told 'em why.
So you can guess what I've been through.
And so for twenty long years I've been thinking of that other guy
and what I saw him do to you.
What I saw him do to you.

Listen. So when tomorrow comes and I walk outside that door,
try to understand the strain.
But if you smile that smile I know I couldn't ask for more.
I know I'd do it all again. Yes I would.
I know I'd do it all again.
