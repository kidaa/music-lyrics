INTRO:

G


VERSE 1:
    G                      D
Sometimes I get upset when people treat me bad
                     C                       G
I don't have time to think and so I get real mad
                                                      C
And I pull my hair and find somewhere where I can be alone
    D                                             G
And when I do I think of you and head myself back home


CHORUS:
          C                 D     G
For I got chores to keep me busy, clock to keep my time
  C              G                                   D
A pretty girl to love me, with the same last name as mine
         C                                G
When the flowers wilt, a big old quilt to keep us warm
              D                                                   G
And I got the sun to see your blue eyes, and tonight you're in my arms


VERSE 2:
Sometimes I get unwound when fancy cars drive past
Money don't get me down, I can't make it last
And I bite my nails and if that fails I go get myself stoned
And when I do I think of you and head myself back home
