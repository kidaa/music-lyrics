Luna plina - lift your veil of silver
Red wine rebellion - drown yourself in vain
Control and strength - cultivating sense
Regressive dreams - living in the past
Atmosfear - emptiness inside
Disintegration - scatered sence of life

Realised impermanence - the sunrise of the human mind
Realised perfection - artwork out of body
Realised corruption - artwork out of mind
Remaining permanence - the sunset of the human mind
