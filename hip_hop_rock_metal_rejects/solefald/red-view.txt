burn the edges of your thoughts
feel the air beneath
burn the edges of your thoughts
feel the air beneath

witness the cosmic dance from a red view

burn the edges of your thoughts
devastating fire
burn the edges of your thoughts
devastating fire

pieces of a paradise never created
floating on the tide of the human mind
washing the shores of the microcosmos
guiding hordes of men
towards the sick and the blindred view

ascend, descend - the order of chaos
stay safe in the eye of the renaissance tornado

see the universe unite and yourself become its key,
and a sense of correlation your opportunity
