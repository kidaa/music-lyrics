You say we've got nothing in common
No common ground you step on
And we're falling apart

You say the world has come between us
Our lifes have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

Chorus:

And I say, what about breakfast at Tiffany's
You say, I think I remember the film
And as I recall I think we both kinda like it
And I say, well that's the one thing we got

I see you the only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
Somewhat now, it's plain to see we're over
And I hated the bigs are over
So much is left on by

Repeat Chorus Three Times
