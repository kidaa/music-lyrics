Jim McBride/Jerry Salley
I haven't had a good night's sleep
In weeks now thanks to you
The ghost of broken promises you made
Haunts every room
A hurtin' heart can't get no rest 'round here
I lie awake and wonder how
Your conscience could be clear

How do you sleep at night
Do you toss and turn till the morning light
Does the darkness help
When you lie down with the truth?
How do you sleep at night?
Are you all alone or do you hold someone tight
Do you see me
When you close your eyes?
How do you sleep at night?Now your side of the bed's as cold
As the lies that I believed
I'm at the point when I can't even
Trust you in my dreams
Did the way you left me leave you feelin' proud?
Or does the loneliness come callin'
When the sun goes down?

How do you sleep at night
Do you toss and turn till the morning light
Does the darkness help
When you lie down with the truth
How do you sleep at night
Are you all alone or do you hold someone tight
Do you see me
When you close your eyes
How do you sleep at night
