Harlan Howard/Bill Hervey
Yes I'll take you back again you knew I would
For I go loving you that's understood
But it's the first time you've come back
With tears in your eyes
Lately someone's taught you how to cry

Someone had to teach you I didn't have the heart
To hurt you just like you've been hurtin' me
Someone had to teach you things its time that you knew
Now maybe you'll be satisfied with me

Someone took your heart and rubbed it in the dirt
And you look just like a puppy when it's hurt
But you've had this lesson coming fo so very long
Our sins have a way of coming home
