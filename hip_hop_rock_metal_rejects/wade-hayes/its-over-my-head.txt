You could've had anyone you wanted
That just goes to show how crazy love can be
Look at us now baby who would have thought it
I don't know why you chose me

It's over my head and I'm six feet tall
This beats anything I ever saw
Well I don't see what you see in me at all
It's over my head and I'm six feet tall

You could be riding in a big Mercedes
But here you are with me in a pickup truck
I never had a way with the ladies
So how'd I fool ol' ladyluck

It's over my head and I'm six feet tall
This beats anything I ever saw
Well I don't see what you see in me at all
It's over my head and I'm six feet tall

Lovin' you comes easy girl my heard is in your hands
It's why you take a chance on me that I can't understand

It's over my head and I'm six feet tall
This beats anything I ever saw
Well I don't see what you see in me at all
It's over my head and I'm six feet tall

It's over my head and I'm six feet tall
