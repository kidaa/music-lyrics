Wade Hayes/Chick Rains
Well I heard it through the grapevine
I guess it must be true
I heard that crowd you're running with
Has changed your attitude
It's been a month of Sundays
Since you've been around
But you always had a good time
On my side of town

I knew that you were born to
The finer things in life
Caviar and foreign cars and bright big city lights
Now you're out there dancin'
In a fancy evening gown
But you always had a good time
On my side of town

Don't forget the one who really loves you
When the glamour starts to let you down
And I'll be right there waitin'
'Til you come back around
'Cause you always had a good time
On my side of townI still dream about you
Every time the music starts
I still hold you close to me
Even though we're far apart
If I ever cross your mind
You know where I'm bound
'Cause you always had a good time
On my side of town

Don't forget the one who really loves you
When the glamour starts to let you down
I'll be right here waitin'
'Till you come back around
'Cause you always had a good time
On my side of town

You always had a good time
On my side of town
