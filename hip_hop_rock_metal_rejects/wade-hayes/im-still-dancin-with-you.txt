I'm sittin' here surrounded by people I know
The beer's cold and the music's good and loud
That used to be enough to put a smile on my face
But tonight I just feel lost in this crowd

There's a brunette on the dance floor
That smiled a time or two
So I got up and asked her for a dance
But when she put her arms around me
And I held her I knew
It was just too soon to take another chance

'Cause I'm still dancin' with you
I know we said we were through
But I keep holdin' on
Letting go is just too hard to do
Even when I'm holding someone new
I'm still dancin' with youWhen the song was over, I held on a little longer
Deep inside I knew that it was wrong
I could hold her in my arms for the rest of the night
But I'd just be leading her on

'Cause I'm still dancin' with you
I know we said we were through
But I keep holdin' on
Letting go is just too hard to do
Even when I'm holding someone new
I'm still dancin' with you

Even when I'm holding someone new
I'm still dancin' with you
