Tonight I came home late again
She didn't ask me where I've been
Her bags were packed and sitting by the door
She looked at me and said goodbye
I did my best to change her mind
But she don't want to hear it anymore

She's steady as she goes
Now she's not crying
If I said it didn't hurt
I'd be lying
Where she got the strength to leave
Heaven only knows
But she's rock steady as she goes

It tears me up to watch her go
But deep inside my heart I know
Leaveing is the only choice she has
I guess she finally got the nerve to give me just what I deserve
She's had enough and she ain't looking back

She's steady as she goes
Now she's not crying
If I said it didn't hurt
I'd be lying
Where she got the strength to leave
Heaven only knows
But she's rock steady as she goes
