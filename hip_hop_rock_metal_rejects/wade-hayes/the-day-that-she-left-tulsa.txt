We were a half mile high on the Ferris wheel
At our old county fair
I didn't even know we had trouble until
She told me way up there
That's when my life started spinning round
My world came crashing to the ground
The day that she left Tulsa

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin' down the drain
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

No she wasn't showing yet but she'd be by Christmas time
Up there like a fool I took for granted it was mine.
She never came out and told me that I was wrong
But all of a sudden the light came on
The day that she left Tulsa

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin' down the drain
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

I guess she thought the truth would end up driving me away
Well she was wrong but I never had the chance to say
The day that she left Tulsa

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin' down the drain
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
