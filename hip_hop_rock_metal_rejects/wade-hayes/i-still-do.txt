Marty Stuart/Chick Rains
Last night when I touched you
It brought back memories
Of the way it felt the first time
I held you close to me
I gave you my heart 
And swore I'd always love you
And I still do

And when I closed my eyes
You were waiting there
Standin' in the moon light
With the wind in your hair
You said there would come a time
I wouldn't dream of you
But I still do

And I still wake up every morning
And I thank God above
Out of all the people on this earth
He gave me to love
Don't you know my heart
And soul belong to you
I swear it's trueSo when you asked if I still need you
After all this time
I can't believe that thought
Would ever cross your mind
The answer is so simple
I just thought you knew
I still do

I still do
