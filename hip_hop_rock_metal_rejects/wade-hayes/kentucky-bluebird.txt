Don Cook/Wally Wilson
Blown down the highway
By two different winds
Lord only knows
When I'll see you again
You're 'bout as close
As the moon up above
You're my long distance love

Kentucky Bluebird
I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you
You fly away

Blue is a feeling I'm learning so well
Turn on the TV
In another hotel
Turn down the volume
And stare at the wall
God I wish you would callKentucky Bluebird
I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you
You fly away

How I hate the miles between us
They get longer each day
I had this dream
And you should have seen us
Holding each other
And drifting away

Kentucky Bluebird
I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you
You fly away
