Chick Rains/Harlan Howard
It won't make the papers
Like some reunions do
There won't be many people
Just me and him and you
I made a childhood promise
You laughed and dried your tears
I swore that I'd bring Daddy home
Tomorrow he'll be here

I tracked him down in Denver
Where he'd lived all alone
He was just another drifter
With a number on his stone
In his things I found a picture
Where his hands had worn it thin
A smiling bride was by his side
Now you'll be this way again

We'll have that family reunion
The one you dreamed of 
Until the day you died
This time Mama he's gonna stay
Forever by your sideI never really knew him
I was no more than a kid
He must have been worth something
If someone loved him like you did
It was hard without a 
man there
You did his part too
I watched your dreams fade
Through the years
But Mama--this one
Is coming true

We'll have that family reunion
The one you dreamed of 
Until the day you died
This time Mama he's gonna stay
Forever by your side
