Wade Hayes/Don Cook/Chick Rains
I go to the job every morning
I work like a dog for my pay
My mind and body aches
It takes two coffee breaks
Top get me to the end of the day
I do what I do
Cause I know when I'm through
I get one more night with you

I hate this old five o'clock freeway
Getting home always takes so long
Traffic moves too slow
With a busted radio
I can't even find a country song
But this road's gonna end and I'm 
gonna spend 
One more night with you

That's all I care about
I wouldn't wanna live without
Knowin that you're waiting
there for me
I don't care what we do
The same old thing or something new
As long as I know there's gonna be
One more night with youI hate to waste the time I spend sleepin
I wake up tired from the day before
All I gotta do is think about you
I grab my hat and I'm running out the door
Pretty soon I'm punchin in
And I do it all again for
One more night with you

That's all I care about
I wouldn't wanna live without
Knowin that you're waiting
there for me
I don't care what we do
The same old thing or something new
As long as I know there's gonna be
One more night with you

One more night with you
