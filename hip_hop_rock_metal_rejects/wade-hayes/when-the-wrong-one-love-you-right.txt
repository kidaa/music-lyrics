Leslie Satcher
Now they all said she was wrong for me
Her tender words were not what they seemed
But, Lord, it's hard puttin' up a fight
When the wrong one loves you right

It's easy to fall, and easy to crawl
When you taste a little and you want it all
You close your eyes and hold on tight
When the wrong one loves you right

But take it from a fool who lost his cool
That girl's tricks sent me back to school
It messes with your heart
It messes with your mind
When the wrong one loves you rightNow boys I'm certain it just ain't worth it
All that cryin' and all that hurtin'
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When the wrong one loves you right

But take it from a fool who lost his cool
That girl's tricks sent me back to school
It messes with your heart
It messes with your mind
When the wrong one loves you right

It messes with your heart
It messes with your mind
