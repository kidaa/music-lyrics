Kix Brooks/Ronnie Dunn
Times are hard and the money's tight
Day to day we fight the fight
Nothing new, the same old grind
Uphill all the way

Boss man says forget the raise
Preacher says to keep the faith
Good things come to those who wait
Tomorrow's another day

Our time is coming
Where or when the good Lord only knows
Our time is coming
When this road we're on will turn to the street of gold

As long as we keep love alive
Something tells me we'll survive
It's the little things that'll get us by
And hold us togetherI feel it when you hold me close
Baby we got more than most
Steady through the highs and lows
We'll go on forever

Our time is coming
Where or when the good Lord only knows
Our time is coming
When this road we're on will turn to the street of gold

Our time is coming
Where or when the good Lord only knows
Our time is coming
When this road we're on will turn to the street of gold

When this road we're on will turn to the street of gold
