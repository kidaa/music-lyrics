Paul Nelson/Larry Boone/Matt King
Word is out how you've been talkin
Bout how you won that woman's heart
You may think it's your charm
That led her to your arms
But the truth is man I did more
than my part

If I'd only been there for her
She wouldn't be yours now
You'd have never had the chance if
I hadn't let her down
Cause it's a cold hard fact
If I hadn't turned my back
She'd have never turned to you
She was never yours to win
She was mine to loseYou might think you're gonna keep her
But you're just loving
borrowed time
Now I know where I was wrong
I'm gonna make it right and it
won't be long
Til that girl is back to being mine

If I'd only been there for her
She wouldn't be yours now
You'd have never had the chance if
I hadn't let her down
Cause it's a cold hard fact
If I hadn't turned my back
She'd have never turned to you
She was never yours to win
She was mine to lose
