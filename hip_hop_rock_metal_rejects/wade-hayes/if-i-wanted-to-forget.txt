Tom Shapiro/Chris Waters
I don't have to go
to those places that we used to go to
I could stay away for days on end
If I wanted to
And I don't have to keep
Your picture by the bed to help me sleep
I could find another dream to dream 
If I wanted to

I don't have to still be in love with you
With your memory running
through my head
I could get over you
Anytime I wanted to
If I wanted to forget
I just don't want to yetI don't have to live
With this heartache that you left me with
I could simply get you off my mind
If I wanted to
But then I'd leave behind
All the moents that were 
yours and mine
And I don't think that's something
I could do
If I wanted to

I don't have to still be in love with you
With your memory running
through my head
I could get over you
Anytime I wanted to
If I wanted to forget
I just don't want to yet
