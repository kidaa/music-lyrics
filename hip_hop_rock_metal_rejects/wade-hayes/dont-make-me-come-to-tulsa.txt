Don Cook
Don't make me come to Tulsa
You know I hate the flight
I ain't been back to Oklahoma baby
Since you said goodbye
I heard a rumor you missed me
I hope to God it's a lie
You know how much I love you
Don't make me come to Tulsa

You had me eatin' right out of your hand
I was your genuine cowboy man
You threw me over for another guy
I ran Dallas on a one way flight
Now I'm accustomed to the shape I'm in
Don't take me down again 

Don't make me come to Tulsa
You know I hate the flight
I ain't been back to Oklahoma baby
Since you said goodbye
I heard a rumor you missed me
I hope to God it's a lie
You know how much I love you
Don't make me come to TulsaI'd love to hold you in my arms tonight
I'd like to think that you'd treat me right
If I believed you'd really wanted me
I'd crawl to Tulsa on my achin' knees
But you'd just hurt me like you did before
Can't take them blues no more

Don't make me come to Tulsa
You know I hate the flight
I ain't been back to Oklahoma baby
Since you said goodbye
I heard a rumor you missed me
I hope to God it's a lie
You know how much I love you
Don't make me come to Tulsa

You know how much I love you
Don't make me come to Tulsa
