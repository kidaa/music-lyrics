Girl, you've got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Part of me says take it slow
And part of me says let it go

Don't - Stop
Don't - Stop
Don't stop doing what you're doing to me

I think we're moving way too fast
We need to take it slow and make it last
I can't keep holding back
When you keep doing things like thatDon't - Stop
Don't - Stop
Don't stop doing what you're doing to me

But I've watched the flame of love go out
Burning love takes a toll
I don't want to lose control

Don't - Stop
Don't - Stop
Don't stop doing what you're doing to me
