Chick Rains/Wade Hayes
Rainbows and falling stars couldn't change
The way things are
Or I'd be in your arms tonight
Wishing don't make dreams come true
Or I'd be holding you
I could change the past and make it right

It's gonna take a miracle
To bring you back
I've got to face the fact
I broke your heart so bad this time
Nothing else is gonna change your mind
You're gone for good I believe
It's gonna take a miracle to bring you
Back to me

So I'll climb up the stairs--get down
And say a prayer
That's the only thing I haven't tried
Lord knows I was wrong & if my faith
Is strong
I just might wake up by your sideIt's gonna take a miracle
To bring you back
I've got to face the fact
I broke your heart so bad this time
Nothing else is gonna change your mind
You're gone for good I believe
It's gonna take a miracle to bring you
Back to me

It's gonna take a miracle
To bring you back
I've got to face the fact
I broke your heart so bad this time
Nothing else is gonna change your mind
You're gone for good I believe
It's gonna take a miracle to bring you
Back to me
