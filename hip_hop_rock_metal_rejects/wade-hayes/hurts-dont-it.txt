Greg Holland/Jim McBride
You've got a lot of nerve comin' here tonight
But that's alright come on in
That look tells me that something's hurt you deep
And you want me back again

Now you don't have to tell me how it feels
There ain't nothin' about lonesome I don't know
And wakin' up alone's a bitter pill
You take one every day and swallow slow
I wish I could help you but my heart tells me not to
It still ain't found the trust you threw away
So you can't have it back no matter how bad you want it
Hurts don't it
It hurts don't itI think you should know it's all I can do
To look at you and not give in
I wish you hadn't made forgiving you so hard
On my heart but you did

Now you don't have to tell me how it feels
There ain't nothin' about lonesome I don't know
And wakin' up alone's a bitter pill
You take one every day and swallow slow
I wish I could help you but my heart tells me not to
It still ain't found the trust you threw away
So you can't have it back no matter how bad you want it
Hurts don't it
It hurts don't it
