When I pull in the drive where your car used to be
It doesn't hurt me like it used to
I can walk through the door, and not wonder anymore
Where you are, like I used to
I can go down the hall, see the pictures on the wall
And not miss you
But I just can't bring myself to go into..

The room
Where I spent every night with you
And the light of the moon
Came through the window
And I held you
We were so close
And it's just too soon
For me to go into the room

I'd remember too much if I opened that door
And I'm not sure if I could face it
The bed's emptiness would remind me you're with
Someone else, and I couldn't take it
So, I sleep on the couch in our living room now
Since our love died
'Cause I'm still not ready yet to go inside...The room
Where I spent every night with you
And the light of the moon
Came through the window
And I held you
We were so close
And it's just too soon
For me to go into the room

Where the light of the moon
Came through the window
And I held you
We were so close
And it's just too soon
For me to go into the room
