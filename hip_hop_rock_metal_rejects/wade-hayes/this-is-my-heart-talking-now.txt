Lewis Anderson/Jason Sellers
I know how much I've hurt you
Trying to stand my ground
Raising my voice building defenses
While trying to tear yours down

I want you so much, I need you so near
Please don't give up til I make that clear
Cause

This is my heart talking now
No anger, no ego, no pride
This is my soul reaching out
With all that I'm feeling inside
The words that I've spoken
They left your heart broken
They came out wrong somehow
But this is my heart
This is my heart talking nowMaybe you're certain it's over
Maybe I can't change your mind
Mabe me saying I'm sorry
Will just seem a waste of time
But I couldn't bare if you walked away
Not knowing for sure that
I love you this way

This is my heart talking now
No anger, no ego, no pride
This is my soul reaching out
With all that I'm feeling inside
The words that I've spoken
They left your heart broken
They came out wrong somehow
But this is my heart
This is my heart talking now

This is my heart
This is my heart talking now
