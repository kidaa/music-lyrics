And in the end we shall achieve in time
The thing they call divine
When all the stars will smile for me
When all is well and well is all for all
And forever after
Maybe in the meantime wait and see

CHORUS
We love the all the all of you
Our lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you

And when I cry for me I cry for you
With tears of holy joy
And did I ever say I'd never play
Or fly toward the sun
Maybe in the meantime, something's gone

CHORUS

Well that sounds fine so I'll see you sunshine
Give my love to the future of the humankind
Okay, okay, it's not okay.
While it's on my mind there's a girl that fits the crime
For a future love dream that I'm still to find
But in the meantime.

CHORUS
