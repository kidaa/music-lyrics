I can't take the truth
From all the lies we've laid
I never caught that perfect light
Or saw those sunset rays
So burn the new age magazines
You preachers and the past
You widowed wives of instigators
I want to be the last

CHORUS
I am the last dictator
You saw the sun today
I am the last dictator
You wanted me this wayI can't take the truth
And all those other games
Like Caesar and hid Christians
The lions never waned
A clever turn of phrase
like 'Belsen was a gas'
I want to see my future first
I want be the last

CHORUS
