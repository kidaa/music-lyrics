We are never coming down
I got up, can't get down
It's like when you get to
the start of the day
The start of the day go run run away

We're still never coming down
the hair of a dog in the face of a clown
like when you get to the start of a day
the start of a day go run run awayThe moral of the story lies
Behind the holes that pass four eyes
Between the cracks in shallow lives
Let the candyman decide

And when you're older just remember
It's not so long since you was younger
Roll around and you're always high
Always look but you never find
Everybody in the world is bent
