Prelude to Space is the Place:
Good afternoon and welcome. Today we celebrate the songs of two of my head parishoners,
Royston and Antony Langdon. In this song, they deal candidly with themes of brotherly love and
homosexuality. Turn now to page number 372, Space is the Place.

SONG

And when you kiss your other lover
Well I will try to understand
And just because you're fucking him
It doesn't mean you don't love me
I do what you want, be what you want to be

CHORUS
Space is the place where I will go when I am all alone and
When nobody calls me on the phone and I am all alone and
I'm meditating in the zone, all alone and
Space is the place where I will go

And just because you kissed your brother
It doesn't mean to say you're gay
'Cause even when you're fucking him
It doesn't mean you don't love me
I do what you want, be what you want to be

CHORUS
