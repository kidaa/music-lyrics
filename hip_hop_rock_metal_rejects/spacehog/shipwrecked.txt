I wonder as I wandered
Do you wonder me?
I always sit, and think of you
And smile in memory

CHORUS
So if you raise a glass
To love you passed
Raise a glass to me
Cause I'm lonely as a sailor
Ship Wrecked on the sea

I always thought the captain's wife
she's the one for me
she may not be a painting
but she's the one for meCHORUS

And as the stars fly by me
So the ocean binds me
And I'm as lonely as a sailor
Ship Wrecked on the sea
