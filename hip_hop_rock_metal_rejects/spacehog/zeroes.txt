Please excuse me
I meant no harm in being born
As world falls open wide
Like a wounded solider falls
Breaks backs in silence
Don't fall around me this time
Don't fall around me this time

My lost awakening
I've found the same as life before
When after another lonely wounded solider falls
like light fantastic
that falls upon my shoulder
fall
don't fall upon my shoulder

She gave me a call
So I gave her a smile
When I asked her for love
And what I should dial
She said 'Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero'Please excuse me
I meant no harm in being born
As world falls open wide
Like a wounded solider falls
Breaks backs in silence
Don't fall around me this time
Don't fall around me this time

I gave her a car
So she gave me a smile
When I asked her for love
And what I should drive
She said 'Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero'
