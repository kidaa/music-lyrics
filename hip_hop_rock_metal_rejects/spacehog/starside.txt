Like when you fall from the sky
And see the world from the side
Love always gets in the way
Just like in Hutch and Starsky

I'd like to leave without a trace
Blow you all to outer space
See you later, now I'm gone
So long, I'll see you when I'm
Starside
Tell me when I'm home
Starside
Tell me when I'm homeSee how we'll fall like a child
Watch them collide
Love always gets in the way
Just like in Hutch and Starsky

I'd like to leave without a trace
Press record and then erase
See you later, now I'm gone
So long, I'll see you when I'm
Starside
Tell me when I'm home
Starside
Tell me when I'm home
Tell me when I'm...home
