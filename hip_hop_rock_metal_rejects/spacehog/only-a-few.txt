can't decide why all of my confidence
Is left high and dry all over and out
The truth should be known for all of it's consequence
Hangs in the balance and shadows my doubt

CHORUS
There's only a few like you
There's only one I to compromise
There's only a few who do
Big boys don't cry

So take me away from this loneliness
facing the shadows and hiding the lights
Truth should be known without which I'm all alone
Lost between this world and hiding from life

CHORUS

And when I get there I will find you
