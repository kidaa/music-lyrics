Terrorizing rule
echoes of ruthless shots
men used as mere tolls
to kill the cops
Fear of accusing
fault not to be excused
hints are still refused
I'm waiting for States to act and take
revenge, because innocents mourn
Up to now we have always seen
those who dared brandish a sword
die and leave hearts torn by grief
heros alone can't win this war
No escape
after being involved
in a frightening bloody game
only monster can play
Politicians winning seats
as long as they protect
the cancer grown inside government's spine
Extortion racket
drug smuggling, tons of money
quickly cleaned by Swiss banks
la Mafia says thanks!
I'm waiting for States to act and break
connections across the whole world
Up to now we have always seen
those who dared brandish a sword
die and leave hearts torn by grief
heros alone can't win this war
