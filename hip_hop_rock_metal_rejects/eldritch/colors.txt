What colors are you God?
What side are you on?
Sure you're conceiving love?
We are born to wage wars!
Check it out from your high throne
Rabid dogs sinking teeth into skin
Hear the screams like xenophobia
What's the color of earth tomorrow?
We'll all be acting like avengers
Thank you God for our planet
Tell us why some people are dark and some bright
Sure you meant just one community?
This difference is spinning the world against its own run...
What's the color of earth tomorrow?
We'll all be acting like avengers...
Disagreeing words sound so hollow...
No one wants to take the blame
What's the color of the race to follow?
...By extreme prejudice...
What colors are you God?
What side are you on?
What's the color of earth tomorrow?
Blowing on the infernal flame
We'll all be acting like avengers...
The color of the pain
Disagreeing words sound so hollow...
No one wants to take the blame
What's the color of the race to follow?
