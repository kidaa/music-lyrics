My mind keeps on showing scenes I don't to want see
Dry tears of my soul did flow again
And I'm sure the unwelcomed dawn will wake me sore
'Cause I know that you can change your role no more
Who else's to blame? Can't hide this shame
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Rain is falling and fades a poem that was nice to write
Words are not enough to tell the pain I feel
'Cause I know what you've done to kill our dream
Sentenced to live in the cage of sins
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Rain is falling and fades a poem thet was nice to write
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Leaves are falling while your eyes look as cold as ice
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Rain is falling and fades a poem thet was nice to write
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Leaves are falling while youe eyes look as cold as ice
