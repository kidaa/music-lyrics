Evil minds and bodies got hold of the feelings
I don't have anymore
So do try to forgeive the excuses and the silly lies I tell
I've forgot the joy of living for somebody to love giving them all
The stole kisses, the forbidden words
That nobody wants to say, nobody wants to say
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why I deny what I fell
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
I don't know why, I don't know why
Free from passion I've become a slave of myself
Free and not feeling love
Cynicism put you in a second place with me
And nothing is gonna change
Mental chaos is keeping me from behind certain
of what I am looking for
Only you can make me understand
what nobody wants to say, nobody wants to say
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why I deny what I fell
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
Help me trying to stop my dying
Give me a reason and be my guide
I'll never prented again and again... If you help me...
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why I deny what I fell
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why I deny what I fell
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
Help me trying to stop my dying
