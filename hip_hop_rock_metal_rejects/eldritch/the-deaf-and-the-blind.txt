Can't move a step you'll get outta bounds
Can't run away from the fire
Besieged and bolted it can't be life
And you wait for the twilight coming on...
Struck bodies that lay down on the ground
Victims of hate whose aim can't be found
Can anybody stop these fights
We play the deaf and the blind
Tortures and slaughters on TV screens
Use the remote everything's allright
Peace keeping countries can't change things
How can they be so blind not to see...
They're killing their race, brothers will die
Their God will follow in silence from the sky
Can anybody stop these fights
We play the deaf and the blind
Does anybody hear children crying
We play the deaf and the blind
They're killing their race, brothers will die
Their God will follow in silence from the sky
Can anybody stop these fights
We play the deaf and the blind
Does anybody hear children crying
We play the deaf and the blind
