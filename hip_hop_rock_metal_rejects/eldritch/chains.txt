Make it out, is your life a real thrill?
find out things that always make you sick
screaming out frustrations kept inside
...do it now! do it now! do it now!
breaking out of appressive...
Jails, clouding keen minds
instincts restrained by invisible...
Chains: express you own personality!
Make it out, did you decide your destiny?
poiting out mistakes you made on your way
bringing out the best you got inside yourself
... do it now! do it now! do it now!
breaking out of appressive...
Jails, blinding hungry eyes
instincts restrained by invisible...
Chains: express you own personality!
Chains, Chains, Chains, Chains, ouch!
Personality
