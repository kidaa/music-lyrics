ready? go, 1,2,3,4[Kim Deal] [Kim Gordon]
if you want me to
I will be the one
that is always good
and you'll love me too
but you'll never know
what I feel inside
that I'm really bad
little trouble girl
remember mother?
we were close
very, very close
sha la la you taught me how to fit it good
sha la la flow down life you understood
sha la la curl my hair and eye lash
sha la la hitch my cheeks and do my lips
sha la la swing my hips just like you
sha la la smile and behave
sha la la a circle of perfection, it's what you gave
sha la la then one day I met a guy
he stole my heart, no alibi
sha la la he said: ";Romance is a ticket to paradise";
sha la la momma, I'm not too young to try
sha la la we kissed, we hugged, we were close
very, very close
sha la la we danced in the sand
and the water rose - higher and higher
sha la la until I found myself floating - in the sky
I'm sorry mother, I'd rather fight
than have to lie
if you want me to
I will be the one
that is always good
and you'll love me too
but you'll never know
what I feel inside
that I'm really bad
little trouble girl
little trouble girl what you doin'?
little trouble girl cross my heart and hope to die,
little trouble girl I can not tell a lie
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu 
little trouble girl ah-hu
