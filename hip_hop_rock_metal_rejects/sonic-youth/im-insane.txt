[Thurston]
Love starved backwood teaser farm girl hot eyed bride
stone cold blonde a quivering menace atomic wallop wholesale murder
we want out
we fish at night
sex in heaven
tough town
a cruel touch
sailors leave
sirens screaming
lap of luxury
a show of violence
take off your mask
lay off my brother
kiss my fist
stop at nothing
a steaming swamp
and a troubled heart
the sky is red
and i can't stop running
her baby stares
the secret's there
so help us god
i'll swing at your funeral
the stubborn air
the killer mob
a red bone woman
a double cross
big fake bitter love underbelly freezing jungle
one step more he'll stir your senses scratch your surface and nail your head
murded angels
bodies in bedlam
a women scorned
you can't hang me
tied to my job a blast scene alibi tied to a tree in a blind alley
nothing before
a big fear
don't get caught
by her father's friends
swamp girl faded
the tiger's wife
a frenzied love
hot climate
twisted passions
flesh parade
dead ahead
a world so wide
big river love camp
the house boy and hill girl
the agony column
don't crowd me
it's time for crime
strange breed river girl's misery index
inside my head my dog's a bear
she was significant
i'm insane

inside my head my dog's a bear
she was significant
i'm insane

inside my head my dog's a bear
she was significant
i'm insane

inside my head my dog's a bear
she was significant

i'm insane
