[Thurston]
I can never forget you - the way you rock the girls
they move a world and love you - a blast in the underworld
I stick a knife in my head - thinking 'bout your eyes
but now that you been shot dead - I've got a new surprise

I been waitin' for you just to say
he's off to check his mind
but all I know is you got no money
but that's got nothing to do with a good time

can you forgive the boy who - shot you in the head
or should you get a gun and - go and get revenge?
a 100% of my love - up to you true star
it's hard to believe you took off - I always thought you'd go far

but I've been around the world a million times
and all you men are slime
it's the gun to my head, goodbye I am dead
wastewood rockers is time for cryin', hey!
