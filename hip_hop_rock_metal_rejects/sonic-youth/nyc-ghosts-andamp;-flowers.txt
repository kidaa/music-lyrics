when the phone rang, 3 in the morning, dead middle of night 
there was nuthin' on the line 
i set back the silent receiver 
tiny flames lit in my head 
hey did any of you freaks here ever remember lenny? 
i can't remember his last name 
he's turned to dust now, one of the chosen few 
left out in the rain, out of town again 
left out in the rain, ocean bound i guess 

between the mattress and a column of hazy faces 
i remember every word you said 
quite a clear picture: ev'ry word you said 
the door was open but the way was not lit 
and there was no way out of my head 

on a crimson hiway by a chrome bumper i last saw you: 
alive 
inclined to thrive 
evening fireflies lit sparks around yr head 

but wait a minute let's back up a bit: 
some famous stars were busted down on fashion avenue 
impersonating real men 
not knowing who they really were 

now here at dark corners all is calm and quiet and good 
the kids are up late dreaming quiet questions in a graceful mood: 


can you please pass me a jug of winter light? 
fold me in an ocean's whim? 
in sweet corrosive fire light? 
in the city made of tin? 

are you famous under the skin? 
familiar with the things you wanted? 
able now to take it all in? 
making peace w every hole in the story? 

did lightning keep you up all night? 
illuminate the soot and grit? 
can you tell how high the sky tonight? 
dig out from under in spite of it? 


can you cover up the one that floats? 
push back the hours? 
i hear yr voice, i speak yr name 
among nyc ghosts and flowers 
will we meet? to run again? 
thru nyc ghosts and flowers
