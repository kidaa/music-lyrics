sunday comes alone again 
a perfect day for a quiet friend 
and you - you will set it free 
i see new morning yound yr face 
everybody sez its another phase 
and now - now its come to me 
see the magic in yr eyes 
i see it come as no surprise 
and you - you turn yr eyes away 
yeah you - you turn it all away 
i guess its true its never too late 
still i dont know what to do today 
oh why - cant i set you free 
will you - do the same for me 
sunday comes and sunday goes 
sunday always seems to move so slow 
to me - here she comes again 
a perfect ending to a perfect day 
a perfect ending what can i say 
to you - lonely sunday friend
