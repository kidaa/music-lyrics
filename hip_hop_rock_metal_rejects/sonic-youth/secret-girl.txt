[Kim]
my mother used to say
you're the boy that can enjoy invisibility
I am a boy that can enjoy invisibility

close your eyes, make a wish
cross yourself, see yourself
feel yourself, scream once more
move yourself, across the floor 
burn inside, between two walls

the advertisement's saying, that pleasure's ever lasting
come touch me

the advertisement's saying, that pleasure's ever lasting
must be dead and gone to heaven
come and touch me here
so I know, that I'm, not there
