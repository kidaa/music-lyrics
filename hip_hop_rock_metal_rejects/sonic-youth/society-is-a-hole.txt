[Thurston]
Society is a hole
it makes me lie to my friends
it's running down my street
with white powers sneakers
on the beautiful beat of black feet
society is a hole
it beats my friends big heads
my friends have big heads,
I can understand it
but I don't recommend it
you got big big hair
and everybody is scared
society is a hole
it makes me lie to my friends
the assault of holy music
there's a slap in my face
my friends are girls wrapped in boys
we're living in pieces
I want to live in peace
Society is a hole[talking]
