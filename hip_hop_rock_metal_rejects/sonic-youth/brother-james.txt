Take my hand he said to me
follow now or you'll be damned
let's go to the other side
let's go to the other side

Great Father, give me the keys
Great Father, give me the keys

Brother James gave them to me
Brother James gave them to meI don't need 'em anymore
someone knockin' at my door
I don't need 'em anymore
someone knockin' at my door

take my hand you might as well
we're going straight to hell
I don't wanna hang around
watch'em stick your head in the ground
