[Thurston]
the turbo goes to rocket put yr kiss in my hand
sensate yr belly down
bend down round this garbage can
pow pound down dirty starfield road
a hot ham slap it muscle skin jam load
blam bam adds explosion to the lamb
Jesus is screaming yr name
violent loving yeah
kissing golden, we're going insane
but where is the shame?
when the star pet is to blame
aah you butt cheeks can't stay
as I spleen my name in flame
