Thurston/Kim 

small flowers crack concrete 
narcotic squads sweep thru poet dens 
spilling coffee grabbing 15 yr old runaway girls 
by frazzled ponytailed hair + tossing them 
into backseats of cop cars 
the narcs beat the bearded oracles 
replacing tantric love with 
complete violence 

lights + mirrors dot the city 
inkstained hippies w/ boxed lunch + marijuana 
mystery plays of shit and nothingness 
blessed by colors from a black hat 

blue lights search thru weeds 
searching for the heart of d.a. levy 
and the mind he left behind 

what didjoo expect? another mystic wreck? 
thats whatchoo got crawling inside yr panic net 
whatdidjoo bring me? not a goddam thing yeh 
+ whatdidjoo leave me? another tombstone dream yeh 
o salacious mansion, the boys held for ransom 
didja see where he1s gone? the blasted summers dawn 
fucked up in cleveland fucked up in cleveland 
short flight to nothing heavens up to something heavens up to something 
levys up to something levys up to something 

death poems for the living gods of america 
plastic saxophones bleat, bleed for nothing, nada 
cops crashing thru doors infuriated by silver charms 
of suburban smoke 
at war with patches of red dirt glitter 
and bluejean fucking + protest
