[Kim]
Slowly pour the liquid down
for miles and miles it flows along
rose coloured neon lighted
swirl around turn around
feel the touch of my hand
swirl around swirl around
fellow shadows black and blue
all around all around
locking arms side by side
crouch down before the fire's light
you're the first day of my lifeI had no belief before
until I had this dream last night
I still remember their savage cries
so serious in their rite
faces painted in joyous fright
in the dawns early light
oh say did you see the colour of my eternity
and the sweat on my skin
our founding fathers laid right down
and indian ghost from long ago
they gave birth to my bastard kin
America it is called
a sensation of eternity
locking arms side by side
crouch down before fire's light
you're the first day of my life
