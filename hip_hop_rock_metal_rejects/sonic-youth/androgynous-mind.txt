hey sad angel walks, and he talks like a girl
out trying to think why it stinks, he's not a girl
now he's kicked in the gut, they fucked him up, just enough
they got me down on my knees, I kiss his ring, God is love

androgynous mind, androgynous mind
androgynous mind, androgynous mind
androgynous mind, androgynous mind

hey hey are you gay? are you God?
my brain's a bomb, to turn you on
everything is all right
god is gay, and you were right

androgynous mind, androgynous mind
androgynous mind, androgynous mind
androgynous mind, androgynous mind

hey hey it's okay, hey hey it's okay x4
hey hey it's okay, hey it's okay x5
hey hey it's okay, hey hey it's okay x6
aaaaaaaawwwooooooowwwaaaaaaaooo

god said it's all right, for you to fight
to free yr mind
whose side are you on?

androgynous mind, androgynous mind
androgynous mind, androgynous mind
androgynous mind, androgynous mind

hey hey it's okay, hey hey it's okay x4
hey hey it's okay, hey it's okay x5
