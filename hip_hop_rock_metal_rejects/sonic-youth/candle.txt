[Thurston]
I see a dog star divin' at his magic, snatchin'
keeps me up awake go crystal cracking
I can't wait
I can't stay, a candle
Gotta change my mind before it burns out

I'm the Cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop

I see a falling snowgirl walking Broadway
Turns the corner at 14th and I know there's no way
It's alright
It's alight candle
And I know she'll be okay by SundayI'm the Cocker on the rock
Humming bash starts shining
In your electric clock

It's safe to say, candle
Tonight's the day, candle
It's alright now, candle
The wind's away, candle
Never thought I'd see a dog star falling

I'm the Cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop
