[Thurston] [Kim]
talking to a punker priest
just dogging the breeze
about beein in a tree / he says it's free now!
along comes Mary Christ
skating light on ice
and says, 'let's go on high' / later, priestoid!
you gotta go - God I got a date now
yeh I know - shall not be late now

possessed by x-ray eyes
her spirit spy's
into my lies / let's burn 'em out now!
wraps my head in skin
says now I'm in
dig the candy skin / yeh spit it out now!
everytime - she sings that low song
everytime - I know I'm right, wrongangel in a devil skirt
buys me a shirt
says I hope you like / uh, like what now!?
hope I hope you like
like you like yr hope
with the tightest rope / I see, I know now!
here we go - I've been waitin so long
yeh I know - for Mary to come along
aaaooooiii
