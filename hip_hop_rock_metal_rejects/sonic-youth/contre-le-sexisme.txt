describe the touch, no its the thought 
its warm and yellow and has a ruffle 
its warm and yellow and... 
hes so quiet i forgot hes there 
and i think here i am. 
oh alice, come back hes just a kitten... 
hes just a kitten 
a thousand leaves for your disguise fall on 
the sky and looking up from down is a sea to 
realize the leaves are falling up and down 
up and round. 
and this is from my heart to you 
a crazy wind will stir me too and contre de la 
sexisme 
i am with you.
