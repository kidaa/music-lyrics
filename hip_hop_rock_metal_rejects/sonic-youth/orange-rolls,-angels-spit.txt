she got you, got you good - didn't have a chance
pretty lady put you in - wear hat master ends ?
oh baby don't you know - you're livin' on the death
you better stay away - if you wanna live

lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah
lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below
oooh - sugar pie
mmm - come on
chocolate spot

she gotta gun and all - don't you even know
she looks into your eyes - angels wanna go ?
she takes it on the stride - leap through mind again ?
don't worry you are fine - living with the mess

lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah
lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below
ooh - sugar pudding
candy tic
orange rolls - angel's spit

boy she's got you got you good - don't you even try?
come on if you could - you would surely die
you take it towards your mouth - you don't even know
come on sugar tic - you are gonna go

lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah
lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below
cool dye - chocolate spot
check her out - don't you know 
deep in my heart - saying g'bye ?
