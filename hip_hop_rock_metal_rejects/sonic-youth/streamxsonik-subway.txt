flipped on my perceptik cogs 
checked in with the future gods 
for melodies of bees and hogs 
start my day the perfect way 

burned a batch of mazzy funk 
poor girl noise and choke style punk 
clapped it on and off I slunk 
to the streamXsonik subway 

first I need my iris scanned 
as I smell the breeze of electric tin 
w/ purple lights i'm motioned in 
wink the gain to minus 10 

fell asleep and missed my stop 
got rousted by a low-beam cop 
got a ticket-patch for illicit flop 
then froze me with his jesus gun that don1t mean i'm shot down yet 
the glow below of the whisper jet 
it all means so much to us 
we dream below the rainbows rust 

clipped on my streetmatik clogs 
pushed thru the hyped-out fervent fogs 
found my way with sensoid jogs 
new radio structure 

state my name and locus frame 
paid the price for crashing fame 
the apprentice sparks his initial flame 
the printout signs says ";further"; 

antique minds with rivered hair 
streamXsonik subway fare 
stay in touch electric dear 
our lightmap eyes together
