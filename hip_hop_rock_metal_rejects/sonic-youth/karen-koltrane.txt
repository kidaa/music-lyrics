Karens moving out 
out into the sky 
Karen trips on a cloud 
Sets down w stars in her eyes 
Shes alone in a room 
Shes deep inside of her mind 
Karens leaving for the snow 
Somewhere to somewhere... blind 
She cut the silver lining in my soul 
I was tethered to her for a time 
are we still together? 
will she stay forever? 
will she stay?... beside... 
flashlight... Karen stay... etc. 
A LOVE SUPREME 
Karen, yr hanging on the line 
wraps yr coat tight around 
Karen, yr eyes are on the prize 
ill catch you on my way down
