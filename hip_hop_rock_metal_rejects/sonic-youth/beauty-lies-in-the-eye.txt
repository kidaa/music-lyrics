There's something in the air there
makes you go insane
brings you back to me
It's been so long
all that I have to do
is live along
It's coming coming down
over me
Do you want to see
the explosions in my eye
Do you want to see
the reflection of
how we used to be
Beauty lies
in the eyes of anothers dreams
Beauty lies
lost in anothers dream
it's coming coming down
over me
Do you want to see
the explosions in my eye
Do you want to see
the reflection of
how it used to behey baby
hey sweetheart
hey fox come here
hey beautiful
come here sugar
