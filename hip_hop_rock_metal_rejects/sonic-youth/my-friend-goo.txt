[Kim] [Thurston. Lee, Steve]
my friend Goo has a real tattoo
she always knows just what to do
she looks through her hair like she doesn't care ?
what she does best is stand and stare

she can play the drums set too
and the boys say: ";hey Goo what's new?";' hey Goo what's new?
my friend Goo just says: ";Hey you";
my friend Goo just says: ";Hey you";

I know a secret or two about Goo
she won't mind if I tell you
she likes to wear green underwear
and lays down almost anywhere

she doesn't have nothing to do
and the boys say: ";hey Goo what's new?";' hey Goo what's new?
my friend Goo just says: ";Hey you";
my friend Goo just says: ";Hey you";

I know a secret or two about Goo
she won't mind if i tell you
I know a secret or two about Goo
I know a secret about Goo and you

and she sticks just like glue
and the boys say: ";hey Goo what's new?";' hey Goo what's new?
my friend Goo just goes: ";Hey you";
my friend Goo just goes: ";Hey you";
