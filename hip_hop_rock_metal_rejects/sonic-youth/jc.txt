[Kim]
always cost a pair of hose - spaces pressed together rose
arms around each others back - you know that I liked you Jack
and all the other boys who pose - a silent dance in the woods
in the suburb light is shown - another can of Coca Cola
don't you ever call me Mom - freckled dancing in the plan 
and air so thin it weighs a ton - you can see as far as fun
you're nothing but a history - a second here and then you're gone
quicksand, quicksand all around - turn the corner just beyond
the shadows move and change the groove - and something tells me not to brood
turning room and that's a show - you're walking through my heart once more
don't forget to close the door - I'm not certain of what you found
all the men want a charming whore - like a crown fortunes
sunny skies and angels bleed - falling down upon my knees
that wasn't how it's supposed to be - clear blue eyes, justice tries
the wind is busy blowing dizzy - you're dreams were shot like a star
exploding in a mind somewhere - doing something on a dare
pulling a trigger like breathing air - a sunkissed boy that gave no thought
to what he'd made while others sake

ocean spreads a candle sand - it's dripping in my hand, you're dead
little brother reminding me - the moments tick forever true
you can see as far as him - don't you know the shape I'm in
you're walking through my heart once more - don't forget to close the door
