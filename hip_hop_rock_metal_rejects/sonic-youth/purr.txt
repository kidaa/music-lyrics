[Thurston]
Whoahooh!

I love you baby 'cause you're back in time - I love you today
yr eyes are flashing like a magic sign - the sun comes out to play

I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you
how to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog
I do it every day - come back again tomorrow
you chased it all away

a dreaming beauty sleeping day and night - the sun around you
I love you baby yeah you're superfine - a-comin' down too
a purring whirring fuzzy lights of day - a-switching sunlight
I chase you kitten catch you every time - funny how it flies

I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you
how to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog
I do it every day - come back again tomorrow
you chase the life away

I hear you purring through a supersoul - a-puff in to it
a puss in leather yeah a prince in gold - a leather tale away

I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you
how to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog
I do it every day - come back again tomorrow
you chase the life away
