Susanne: That's what you should do, you should be dinosaur's manager 
Kim: y'know dinosaur has like ten managers 
Susanne: they don't have any other managers 
Kim: they have like...are you kidding? they have a manager in every city 
Susanne: it'd be such an easy job though to just tell them what to do, i think 
Kim: ahhh, yeah but, it's like, they want you to do everything else like they're 
that kind of band like they don't wanna do anything 
Susanne: yeah but that's easier, to do everything than to just do some of it, 
it's easier y'know 
Kim: that's true, and have somebody else... 
Susanne: and then have somebody else fuck up what you've done by doing part of 
your job it's like easier just to do the whole thing 

Susanne: in some ways i think like somebody like redd kross would be easy to 
manage cos they'd just be so like ``well, whatta we do now?"; and you 
just tell them and that would be it 
Kim: they just wanna rock 
Susanne: yeah right they don't wanna do anything 
Kim: they just wanna be rock gods, y'know 
Susanne: [?] snare 

Susanne: so let's call j 
Kim: ok 

Kim: hello, is j there? oh um can you just tell him kim and susanne called, ok,
