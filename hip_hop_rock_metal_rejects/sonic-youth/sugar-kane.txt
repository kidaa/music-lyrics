[Thurston]
you're perfect in the way, a perfect end today
you're burning out their lights, and burning in their eyes
I love you Sugar Kane, a-comin' from the rain
oh kiss me like a frog, and turn me into flame
I love you all the time, I need you 8 to 9
and I can stay all night, yr body shining

and I know
there's something down there sugar soul
back to the cross a twisted lane
there something down there sugar kane

I'm back again in love, I'm back again a dove
where'd you get your light, your smilin' sugar life
another lovers day, another cracked up night
every night I say, the light is coming

and I know
there's something down there sugar cone
back to the cross a twisted lane
there's something down there sugar kane

hey angel come and play, and fly me away
a stroll along the beach, until you're out of time
I love you sugar kane, a crack into the dream
I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar kane
I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar kane
I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar
