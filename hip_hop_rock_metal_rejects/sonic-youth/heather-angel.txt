never gonna ya do it 
a world below 
heather angel you are somewhere 
on the show 
dont you think you would find 
where to go 
I want to go dancing on the other side 
I want to buy a phonograph 
but the moneys gone 
he bought books and records 
I dont care about that 
I just want to be alive 
and go to the other... 
I dont want money or books 
have to decide 
passive 
and you were shot in the name of it 
and then youd see yeh, yeh 
then youd see 
the relationship 
and walking I see you in the clouds 
and I fall for 
I would fall for you 
I would... 
forever 
goodbye, bye 
goodbye 
and that is all
