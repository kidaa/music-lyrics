[Thurston]
What are you waiting for?satan flirts
i'm prepared
it's nothing to conquer
the fight is good
your flesh has a limit
of too many years
it's a shock absorber of your stinging tears
the satisfaction
and power
and control
and piss
is ruled by the laws of deception
lost in laws of deception
we shake our heads
as your tables turn
they'll always turn
and you'll never burn
that's the real promise
you'll never burn
you get the lies
we get the fire
you get the lies
we get the fire
