im here for you 
cant you see what im doin 
i bring you news from the kingdom 
of disciples in ruin 
behold a child 
has just been born 
into a life 
of secrets sworn 
hold out yr hands 
and take these palms ive been given 
they are wild with beauty faded 
and they can guide this child to heaven 
so rest assured 
and understand 
how harvest eyes 
renew your land 
im here looking for you dear 
if i could see clear 
thry all the sun stained stations 
its all up in the air girl 
its like a snare girl 
in all its manifestations 
im here for you 
cant you see what im saying 
i have palms from the ruins 
where disciples are straying 
im coming after you 
with mercy given 
and your secrets out 
now youre forgiven 
im here looking for you dear 
cant you see clear 
all these sun stained stations 
its you under the stairs girl 
with a snare girl
