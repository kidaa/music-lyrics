To the extent that I wear skirts
and cheap nylon slips
I've gone native
I wanted to know the exact dimension of hell

come on down to the store
you can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
you can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
you can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
you can buy some more, and more, and more, and moreI grew up in a shotgun row
sliding down the hill

you can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
come on down to the store
you can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
come on down to the store
you can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
you can buy some more, more, more, more
