[Thurston]
here we go to another candle I know
all the girls there playin' on a jelly roll

time to take a ride - time to take it in a midnite eye
and if you wanna go - get on below
pinking out the day - dreaming out the crazy way
finger on the love - it's all above

everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
a satellite wish will make it just enough
you'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

time to rock the road - and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
dirty boots are on - hi di ho
pinking out the black - dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue - now it's undone

I got some dirty boots - yeah dirty boots
I got some dirty boots - baby
dirty boots

hey!
