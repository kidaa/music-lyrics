[Thurston]
I maintain that
Chaos is the future
And beyond it is freedom
Confusion is next and next after that is the truth
You gotta cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth

Stick your fingers
In your mouth
Squeeze your tongue
And wrench it out
From its ugly fucking cancer
Its ugly fucking cancer
Root
You gotta cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth

Chaos is the future
And beyond it is freedom
Confusion is next and next after that is the truth
You gotta cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth

In your mouth
Squeeze your tongue
And wrench it out
From its ugly fucking cancer
Its ugly fucking cancer

You gotta cultivate what you need to need

Tell nothing but the truth
