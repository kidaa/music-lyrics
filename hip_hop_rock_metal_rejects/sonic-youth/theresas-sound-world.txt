[Thurston]
like girl come walkin' thru the cornfield
like blue vibration thru the sea
I know I'd love her to breathe, again
like cubes are talkin' her down

I've been a wasted day
like spinning round a saint
like colored wild sign
Theresa talkin' in the rainlike girl be growin' thru town
windows are thoughts in the stain
I know I'd love her to stay
whispering signs are agreeing

like talkin' golden terrain
like thrivin' dark in the saint
a cat in gold goes along
Theresa's sound for the king
