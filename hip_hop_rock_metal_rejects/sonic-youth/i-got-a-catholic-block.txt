[Thurston]
I got a catholic block
inside my head
I let it go to work
Bring it all back home

It serves you right
And I can motor down
You got to earn yr freedom
Get it on my own

I just live 4ever
There just is no end
I just trust the oppression
Like I trust yr friendsI got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it play around
Iron to gold

Come back to me awhile

I got a catholic block it's around my head
I got a catholic block and it's blood orange red
I got a catholic block do you like to fuck?
I got a catholic block guess I'm out of luck
