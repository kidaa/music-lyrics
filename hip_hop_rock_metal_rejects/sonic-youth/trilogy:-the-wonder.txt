[Thurston]
See flashing eyes
they're flashing cross to me
burnin up the sky
sunshinin to me
yr locus crown
copkillin heartbeat
head's lookin down
bowin out to the street

I'm just walking around
yr city is a wonder town

lips red to white
lips green in blacked night
yr spirit flares
flarin up leonine

I'm just walking around
yr city is a wonder town

transmitter rhyme
transmitter all the time
lookin up to the sky
I'm seeing ghosts flyinI'm just walkin around
yr city is a wonder town

I think I been there once before
something tells me there's so much more
she's back in town to even the score
time to go

See flashing eyes
They're flashing 'cross to me
Burnin' up the sky
Sunshining into me
Your locus crown
Cop-killin' heartbeat
Head's lookin' down
Bowin' out, to the street

I'm just walkin' around
Your city is a wonder town
