Look before you leap, okay?   
Do you read me?   
May all your dreams come true   
He's standing by the door   
He's got something in his hands   
All the money's gone   
All the money's gone   
The days we spend, go on and on  
Shift  
Fucking youth  
Working youth  
May all your dreams come true   

A lot of people suffer   
From impotence   
All the money's gone  
The days we spend go on and on   
Fucking youth   
Working youth   
Fucking youth   
Working youth  
Fucking youth  
Fucking youth  
Working youth 


 [Lee]  
You slept  
Did I drift?  
Do I dream?   
Do you read me?   
I'm not speaking   
Do you read me?  
I dream  I dream  

Sound today are you sound today  
are you sound today?  
Sound today are you sound today  
are you sound today?  
Today  
These things don't happen  
automatically  
I dream  
Edith moves each step  
Fucking youth   
The days we spent go on and on  
I dream  
Do you read me?
