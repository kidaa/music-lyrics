[Kim]
smile like a sun, back over time
crazy fr you, pleasure is mine
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

you're coming thru, even it up
going too far, try understand
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?whisper kiss yr ear, I'll tell you what I fear
whisper the kisses in yr ear, I'll tell you what I fear

come on home, just ain't fair
name of rock'n'roll, where love dies
couldn't find a soul, tell it like it is
deep down inside, drunken butterfly
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?
