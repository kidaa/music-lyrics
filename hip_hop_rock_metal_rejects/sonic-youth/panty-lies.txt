don't just stare, `cause she's not wearing underwear
em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
oh how rude, at least she's got you're attention square
em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
don't you realize, It's just her disguise
ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
hey! mum look, no more panty line
ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai

peek-a-boo look into the mirror
now you see her, now you'll be her
hover your lips, twirl your hair
pretend you're there, pretend it ain't there
little girl playing in the closet

she says: ";who am I?";
inside! outside! 
inside, outside, inside, outside, inside, outside,
inside, outside, inside, outside
shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa shoewa
hm-a-hm-a-hm-a-hm-a
da-da-da-da-da

don't just stare, `cause she's not wearing underwear
em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
oh how rude, at least she's got you're attention square
em-em-em-em-em-em-em-em
don't you realize, it's just her disguise
ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
hey! mum look, no more panty line
