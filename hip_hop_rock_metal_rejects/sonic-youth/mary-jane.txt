LOOK WHO'S BACK ON THE PROGRAM
HOOKIN UP ANOTHER FLY JOINT 
WHEN I FLOW ON THE SLOW JAM.
WHEN I SHIFT I KICK TO GO
LIKE I FAT DRUNK AND I LIGHT UP A FAT SPLIFF.
TAKE A WIFF CAN YOU SMELL THAT IN THE AIR
WHEN THE SMOKE COME OUT THE BUILDING FROM EVERY WHERE.
SHIT I STILL GET DOWN SO JUST SIT DOWN
WHEN MY THOUGHTS STOPS CRAWLING
TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH
YET I GO WRONG YOU GOT TO HIT MY BONG
LATER ON THEN ALL BE GETTING HIGH ALL ALONE

AND SHE MAKE ME FEEL STANGE,
NOW I'VE GOT TO CALL OUT HER NAME.

I LOVE YOU, MARY JANE
