[Thurston]
here it comes again - out of the rain
seems to have a new - kind of same
been it playing on a - simple rhyme
the site comes alive and - speaks the mind
it turns to me and - it turns to gold
it turns to see a - the fast lane slow

it's been a way too long
it's been the way I gone
it's a-coasting on
to the west star

looking out I thought I - saw it blink
coming on to me - like a silver eye
pick it up and - turn it on and
head on out to a - western starlandit's been a man and gone ?
now it's a singing song
like a western star
it's going my way

looking out I'm back in - time to stay
into the eastern - silent way ?
comes alive through - through and clearer ?
ghost arise to - dirty mirror ?

you've been away too long 
it's been way too long
an eastern star is on
a disappearer
