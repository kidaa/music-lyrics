We all know our place 
Like the trophy in the case 
We are never known 
the wallpaper in the room 
We all know the joys 
See the beauty of our toy 
We are not your song 
Elevator, shopping malls 
We all want what's free 
'Cause we have no memory 
We are coming home 
Find out we are not alone 

Sir yes sir...

We are not the ones 
Who will take away your guns 
We are not affraid 
Of some transcendental pain 
We will win the fight 
With explosive dynamite 
You are never wrong 
Like the line in your palm 
We will not resist 
Simplify it with a kiss 
We want victory 
Fresh celebrity 
We all want what's free 
'Cause we have no memory 
We are coming home 
We know we are not alone 

Sir yes sir...

The best of everything is good enough for me, not for me 
We are not the the ones 
Who will take away your sons 
We are not affraid 
Of a splattering of brains we won't let them ? 
With a touch of ? makes a crime 
We see from above 
Send a mushroom cloud of love 
We salute 
We even speak the truth 
Shoot a victim man 
'Tis a sacrificial lamb 
We all want what's free 
'Cause we have no memory 
We are coming home 
Find out we are not alone
