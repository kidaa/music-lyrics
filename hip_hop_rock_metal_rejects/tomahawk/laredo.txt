Been shanghaied down in Laredo
The sunshine sticks to the dusty floor
I'm listenin' for the pay phone
A flask rolls in through a hole in the screen door
The cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river X4
Guess you found out that you can't hold your liquor
Keep your eyes shut, it'll go down quicker
The cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river, now
Stolen from a shoebox
Those sweet snapshots
Blackmail on rocks
Knickle on a squirt gun
The jailbirds sing at the crack of dawn
We got records, they're locked in my head
I gotta a feelin' this deal has gone bad
The cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river X4
Well, put it in the car, got revenge in my liver
Just pass the sign, outside the city limit
The cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river, now
Stolen from a shoebox
Those sweet snapshots
Blackmail on rocks
Loredo, loredo
The cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river X4
Well, put it in the car, got revenge in my liver
Just pass the sign, outside the city limit
The cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river, now
Stolen from a shoebox
Those sweet snapshots
Blackmail on rocks
