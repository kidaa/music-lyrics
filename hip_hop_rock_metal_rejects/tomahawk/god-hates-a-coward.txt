I've sewn my seeds with a metric grosse
No footsteps go beyond it
I'll eat the death
Where the rooster crows
Fresh rodeos, yee-har
It's just to push in your teardrops
Make you a cyclops
Breakin' the branches off your family tree
Keep you up like a fluffer girl
Ain't that enough of the
Look in the sewer for my pedigree
Your truly cause repeats its pulse
And makes your tears, if you needed too
Make me blow my brains out 
Pointin' the gun 
Put my neck in a noose 
But I'm hangin' tough
Day, by, day, by, day, by, day, by X2
Listen closer to your mother
You can hear ocean roar
Sittin' quiet in the corner
Put another record on
God hates a coward, sonny
Got a date with your VCR
Watch another action movie
Dream of me
On the only piano 
Wrote the fuckin' concerto 
Shoot pool with your eyeballs 
Rack 'em up 
Make a meal of your asshole 
Gnaw on your fat soul 
Dipping your heart in my vinegar 
Like a million disappeared 
Just how long did you think they would live or: just like if they were lizards 
Prepare yourself 
Come on defend 
And if you ever want to be ?????piggy? 
Give me something to squeeze 
And give me something to kill I'll never finish my plate 
Or I'll burn it up 
Day, by, day, by, day, by, day, by X2
