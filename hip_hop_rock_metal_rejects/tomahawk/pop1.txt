Something's wrong today
I cross the barricade
The police lines evaporate
What will I do with all this empty space
Seas part for my parade???
Traffic stops to give me right of way
How will I feel/fill all this empty space
Just hold my breath and dive in
This beat could win me a grammy  X6
The hole is so big and the gap is so wide
Now you're humpin' me
With hip-hop beats every night
Put a cloud up over all I've done
And now I'm coming back
?
Hit the ball before they're gonna forget
No matter who I am
And see how low I can go
This beat could win me a grammy
This beat could win me a grammy  X6
In the hole all alone
I want a sympathy vote
I'll take a promenade
I'll take the scenic route
And I can't put a band aid over the ?
No matter who I am, I fucking am, just can't
Because I'm over remembering her
And her romeo
I wish I didn't know
This beat could win me a grammy
Voices collaborate
Like wind in dried grass
What will I do with all this broken glass
7 years of good luck
