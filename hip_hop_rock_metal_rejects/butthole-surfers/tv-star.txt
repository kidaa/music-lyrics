I'm holding a letter that I wrote last night

Tryin' to remember what it says inside

The words are written but never been said

Your voice keeps calling in my head

I don't believe it's time

But I try to say goodbye

But I feel so lost inside

I don't know my name

And I can't erase what's weighing on my mind

It says I'd be leavin' on a redeye plane

But I know I'm coming back again

You've heard the story a thousand times

The song is playing in your mind

I'm asking myself why

Then I try to say goodbye...

But I feel so lost inside

I don't know my name

I can't erase what's weighing on my mind

I try to stay awake, trying to write the words

And I'm trying to write the word goodbye

... to say goodbye

But I feel so lost inside

I don't know my name

And I can't erase what's weighing on my mind

And I try to say goodbye

But I feel so lost inside

And I try to say goodbye

And I try...

And I try... to say goodbye

And I try to say goodbye

I try...

And I try...
