I've got no chauffeur to chauffeur me
I've got no servant to serve my tea
But I'm as happy as a man can be
Because I've got a girl who loves nobody but me

I don't own stock in no stock exchange
I don't hold claim to no real estate
But I'm not living my life in vain
Because I've got a girl who loves nobody but me

And everytime my sweetie goes walking
Down some sunny street
She always sets the whole town to talking
'Cause she's a genuine Athenes from her head down to her feet

I don't rank high in society
I don't possess a PhD
But I'm all set confident-u-ally
Because I've got a girl who loves nobody but me, now
