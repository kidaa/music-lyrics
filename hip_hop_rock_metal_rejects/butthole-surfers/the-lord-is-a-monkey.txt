Julie's got the word today She lost her job just one last pay
life don't come easy anymore
still strugglin' on by herself got a picture of jimmy there on the shelf
and she looks at him and says why did we let it go
I know that sometimes baby we didn't see things eye-to-eye
but I got just one question Did we have to say goodbye?
Just like prisioners in paradise
Still far from heaven's door
we had it all but still we wanted more
now I realize that I can't Turn back the future here to stay
but hey we're just children of tomorrow
hangin' on to yesterday
Jimmy still recalls the night When he took his guitar and headed on out
to find the big time that was his dream
he gave up his past and made it alright
but there's something missin' in his heart tonight
sometimes what you want ain't what you need
He misses drivin' down to the lake at night
Holdin' his baby in his arms so tight
ain' t it hard to find illusions when you're livin' in a memory
Just like prisioners in paradise
so close but yet so far
there will come a time no matter who you are
when you ask yourself was it right or wrong
for me to turn away,
but hey we're just children of tomorrow hangin' on to yesterday
