We been running strong
From the east to the west
We been banging fenders
To give you all the best
We been setting records in every state
Well their aint no car
Like a big V8

To the boys from the bush
we're back in town
Well the cars in the back and the shutters down
We're all heading for the Bathurst field
To see Brokky and the boys serving up a thrill

We've been feeling the heat
You can hear it cuss
We've been kissing the fences
Been choking on dust
We curse the rain
We curse the sand
We're running hot
Turn it on for the fans

To the boys from the bush
We're back in town
When the green flag drops
My foot goes down
We're all members of the horsepower sect
And the king of the mountain is the guy you've got to get

We work our cars
From go to whoa
It's the greatest race
It's the ultimate show

To the boys from the bush
we're back in town
Well the cars in the back and the shutters down
We're all hear we're the Bathurst Boys
And you can't hear richo above the noise

To the boys from the bush
we're back in town
When the big guns roar
It's shaking the ground
Steering straight and stay off the wall
You get the checked flag and your walking tall
You get the checked flag and your walking tall
