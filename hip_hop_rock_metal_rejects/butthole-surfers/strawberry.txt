How, how we carried on
How I used to walk with you
And talk with you
Until I moved away
Oh, although some things may change
Others stay the same
We're not four anymore
But can you come out and play

[b-sec]
You wore pigtails and hand-me downs
I banged the piano
Played the clown
And though time slips away
It can never replace
How you'll always be here in this heart of me

[chorus]
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh how Snoopy he never left the ground
Oh that is true
You remember me like I remember you

[verse]
Oh, I wonder where you are
My heart says you're not far from me
It's so hard for me
To leave those years behing
Ohhhhhh, cotton candy carousels
Gotta find that wishing well
To wish you back to me
That's the way I feel inside

[b-sec]
You wore pigtails and hand-me-downs
I banged the piano
Played the clown
And though time slips away
It can never replace
How you'll always be her in this heart of me

[chorus]
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh how Snoopy he never made a sound
Oh that is true
You remember me like I

[bridge]
How we laughed in the face of danger
Tanto and the lone ranger
There was no mountain we could not climb
We soard like eagles 'cross the sky
Heaven knows
How I miss those little toes

[short piano interlude]
[b-sec]
You wore pigtails and hand-me-downs
I banged the piano
Played the clown
And though time slips away
It can never replace
How you'll always be here in this heart of me

[chorus]
Lucy and Linus and Charlie Brown
Oh how Snoopy he never left the ground
Oh, it is true
You remember me like I
You remember me like I
You remember me like I remember you
Like I remember you
