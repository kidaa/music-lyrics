DEXTER and ARMSTRONG:

Gentlefolk of Newport

Or should I say 'hats and cats,'

Please lend an ear

That ye all may hear

Some shimmering sharps and flats.

For those cozy virtuosi,

Known as 'hipsters' to the trade,

Wish to show you now

Precisely how

Jazz music is made.

Take some skins,

Jazz begins,

Take a bass

Steady pace,

Take a box,

One that rocks,

Take a blue horn New Orleans-born.

Take a stick

With a lick,

Take a bone,

Dixie-grown,

Take a spot,

Cool and hot,

Now you has jazz jazz jazz, jazz, jazz.

Now you has,

Now you has,

Now you has,

Now you has,

Now you has,

Now you has,

Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz,

Now you

Has,

Now you

Has,

Now you

Has,

Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz.

Jazz,

Jazz,

Jazz,

Jazz,

Jazz,

Jazz,

Now you has jazz,

Now you has jazz,

Now you has jazz.

EXTRA REFRAIN

If you sail

Over the sea,

Take my tip

They're all molto hip

In Italy.

As for France,

B'lieve it or not,

Frenchmen all

Prefer what they call

'Le Jazz Hot.'

Take a plane

Go to Siam,

In Bangkok

Today, 'round the clock,

They have a jam.

Indians on

The Amazon

Beat one bar

And all of 'em are

Gone, man, gone.

From the Equator

Up to the Pole,

Through the air

You hear ev'rywhere

Rock and roll.

From the East

Out to the West,

Jazz is king,

'Cause jazz is the thing

Folks

Dig

Best.
