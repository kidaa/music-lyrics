Everybody's been caught in the act
Everybody's been caught in the act
Everybody's been caught in the act of love
I find it hard to believe
This has happened to me
I've fallen again and I'm on my knees
I'm baring my soul and it's all for you
That's what I always seem to do
I can see no other way
Than to give you all my love
So I'll take it slow
But before you know it
You've tied up my heart
I'm in chains
I've been caught
In the act of love
I feel so crazy
What can I do
I've been caught
In the act of love
And it's all down to you
I've fallen in love
I've opened my heart and I'll let you in
I should have been patient be sure I'll win
But there's nothing I could ever hide
I may be a fool but it's all for you
I can se no other way
Than to give you
all my love
So I'll take it slow
But before you you know it
You've tied up my heart, I'm in chains
