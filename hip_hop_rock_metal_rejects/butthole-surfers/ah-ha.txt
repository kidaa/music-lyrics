You turn out the light
and the dark sucks on the embers of the fire
that shoulders in the night
and these tumbling boulders of desire
come rolling off the shadows of me

You say I thought time was meant to take away the hurtin'
as your lonely silhouette closes the curtain
back on the road destination uncertain
so lets get in this car and drive
and this feeling I feel so strong
so powerful it can't be wrong
now the whole frosted night is just a song
song for you

And the moon is splashed right over the street
like my tears on your thighs so pale
its just you and me in the sheets
and I hope the whole wide world is just a jail
when you're away from me

And its rolling on by
here come the night
turn out the light
and the dark sucks on the embers of the fire
that smoulders in the night tumbling boulders of desire
rolling, rolling...
rolling out the shadows of me
turn out the light
