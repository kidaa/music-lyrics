I can't stand your nagging any more

Hey boy now just listen to me
Stop playing with me enough of it
I'm clearly fed up with you boy
Can't stand your naggin' any more

I was head-over-heels in love
Don't get your knickers in a twist
I should tell you where to get off
Just want to be alone at least

Hey stop it's chillin' me out
Don't want to be yours for free
You make me losin' my control
Can't take your cheatin' any more
