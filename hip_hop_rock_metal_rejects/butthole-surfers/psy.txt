if the punx, are united
they will never, be divided
x8

fast and loud our sound is strong
young and old singing along
all around this fucking world
underground punk will be strong

Chorus x2
together we survive- punx unite
divided we will die- punx unite

no divisions or tribal wars
no more fighting at thoe shows
drinking together singing songs
underground punk will be strong

Chorus

forming bands, setting up shows
writing zines, getting involved
no more posers at the shows
underground punk will be strong

Chorus

Repeat 1st Verse
