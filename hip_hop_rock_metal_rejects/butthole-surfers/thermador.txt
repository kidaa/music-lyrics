If We Take Our Time,

And We Stick Together,

Everything We Do Will Go Our Way.

And If We Try,

Now and Forever,

No Matter Comes Next,

We'll Be Okay.

Let's Kick It Up!

Shout Out All The Things We Can Do!

Let's Kick It Up!

Now There's no Tomorrow!

Let's Kick It Up!

Cause They Ain't Seen The Last Of Me And You!

Let's Kick It Up!

Together.

And We Realize,

What's On the Surface,

Ain't Picture Perfect,

But That Don't Mean A Thing.

One Thing I Know,

Is There's A Purpose,

And Like The Circus,

We're Hanging From The Rings.

Let's Kick It Up!

Shout Out All The Things We Can Do!

Let's Kick It Up!

Now There's no Tomorrow!

Let's Kick It Up!

Cause They Ain't Seen The Last Of Me And You!

Let's Kick It Up!

Together.

Together.

One, Two, Three!

If We Take Our Time,

And We Stick Together,

Everything We Do Will Go Our Way.

I Have No Doubt,

This Situation,

Then We'll Enjoy Another Day.
