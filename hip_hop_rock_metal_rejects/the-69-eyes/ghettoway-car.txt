I wasn't born for this drab city life
Never gonna work from 9 to 5
A voice telling me deep inside
I don't belong to this world of suit and tie
Who lives only for bread and circuses
I need more than just MTV
There ain't no future of any kind
`Cuz we ain't got a one-way ticket to ride

We got to GETAWAY from the GHETTOWAY CAR
I got to GETAWAY from the GHETTOWAY CAR
I got to GETAWAY from the GHETTOWAY CAR
I got to gotta gotta gotta GETAWAY!

They try to get you dead or alive
I wouldn't sell my soul for a dime
I need a chance that never get
Still got in me some self-respect
Mr. Corruption rules the City of Sin
Born to lose but I never give in
You better act on my advice
Fuck that one-way ticket you ride
