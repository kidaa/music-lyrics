Lights out all night
I've been lying there
Shiverin' and shakin'
Heart full of fear
Everything's gettin' much too clear
Life's a bitch
I just let you too near

On and on this beat is gettin' much too strong
Higher and higher the flames burnin' higher
I took the self-destruction desire

P-A-I-N MR. PAIN
Takes you like a hot summer rain

I'm seein' snakes
And feelin' stone dead
Spiders and roaches dancin' in my head
All fucked-up in the hospital bed
Fire queen nursie
Paint the town red

On and on...

[Chorus]

I need a fix 'n' a kiss
Can't get worse than this
Everybody's so slow
I'm goin' much too fast

[Chorus]
