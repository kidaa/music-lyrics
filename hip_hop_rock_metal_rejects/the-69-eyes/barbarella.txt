times are getting harder everyday
stars seem to be so far away
but she's waitin' for me
I'm sure she does
SHE'S BA-BARBARELLA BARBARELLA
MY LAZER-SHOOTIN' PLANET QUEEN
Everytime I see this movie
I feel so cozmic 'n' groovy
When she's starin' at me
From my own tv
SHE'S BA-BARBARELLA BARBARELLA
MY LAZER-SHOOTIN' PLANET QUEEN
She's the sleaze goddess travelling thru the space
A good body a beautiful face
The electric universe blows my mind
A trip in her shin there's no other kind
[Etc]
