Nothing's here easy
Nothing's here clean
You gotta take what you can get
Life is for real
No more sympathy
No no more humanity
Streets give and streets take
Tomorrow comes everyday
Too late 
I know we'll meet again
Streetwalking cheetahs at the world's end !
GOT TOO MUCH TO LOOSE TO LOOSE WITH YOU 
Technology and satellites
Still no-one here gets out alive 
A new star comes out in the sky 
Crazy diamonds they never ever die
I know we'll meet again 
Streetwalking cheetahs at the world's end
GOT TOO MUCH TO LOOSE TO LOOSE WITH YOU
