I wanna feel you now like a thousand lies 
Bleeding out of your heart 
Burning in the night 

Don't wanna see you crying 
Fallen out of light 

I wanna feel you now 
Like an august rain 
Kissing summer goodbyes 
I wanna see your pain 

Don't wanna see you crying 
Fallen out of light 

I don't wanna see you crying little angel on my shoulder 
I wanna see you flying back to heaven where you belong 

I wanna feel you now like a thousand knives 
Digging out of my heart 
Burning in the night 

Don't wanna see you crying 
Fallen out of light 

I don't wanna see you crying little angel on my shoulder 
I wanna see you flying back to heaven where you belong 

Don't wanna see you crying little angel on my shoulder 
I said alright gonna get you crying 
Come hell or high water since you've been gone
