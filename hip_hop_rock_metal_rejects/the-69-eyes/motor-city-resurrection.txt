The city's the bitch
We're its misfit kids
Raised on the streets
When we cut honey
We bleed
Dancin' on the dead beat

MOTOR CITY RESURRECTION HONEY
MOTOR CITY RESURRECTION

Shootin' up lika
Shit outta luck
Livin'on the Chinese Rocks
You cannot choose
The way you lose
City wolves preyin' upon you

[Chorus]
