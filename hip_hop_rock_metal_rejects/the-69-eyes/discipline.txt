My heart is burnin' w/ desire
To push the limits a lil' bit higher
Love hurts so they say
You will like it babe so you do it my way
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU RIGHT NOW
PRETTY BABE SOME DISCIPLINE
YOU BETTER TAKE IT
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU RIGHT NOW SOME OF IT
Love is much more painful than it seems
Our love is made from the secret dreams
Just obey all my rules
Be a pupil in my love school
[Repeat chorus]
