she's a woman when she's walkin' down the street
she makes you turn your steering wheels
she gives you throb and makes you sweat
all dressed up in black leather
stiletto high-heels maybe some rubber
don't burn your eyes she's dressed to kill
she's JUICY JUICY LUCY
she's gonna teach you high-class pleasures
you will learn that pain's a treasure
she's pushin' the limits you're beggin' for more
if you're a really naughty slave tonight
she's gonna punish you that's right
she locks you into a cage and loses the key somewhere
she's JUICY JUICY LUCY fulfill my dreams
