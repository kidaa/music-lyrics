As the night draws
its shadows on you
and the darkness
turns you blue
as the darkness turns to blue
and the night follows you
don't let the moonlight burn you

Please stay - don't let it burn away
and if you stay - let it turn us grey

As the night falls
seals you through
and the darkness
turns you blue
as the darkness turns to blue
and the night surrounds you
don't let the moonlight burn you

Please stay ......
