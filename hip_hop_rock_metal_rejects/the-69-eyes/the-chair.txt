Just walk away from these dreams 
And talk the pain what it seems 
Angel of my revelation 
I don't really want to let you walk 
Away from these dreams 

You gotta turn it all over, you gotta turn it all over 
All over again 

Kick the chair right down under me 
Leave me hanging alone in misery 

Walk away from these dreams 
And talk the pain what it means 
Angel of my revelation I don't really want to hurt you 
So walk away from these dreams 

You gotta turn it all over; you gotta turn it all over 
All over again 

Kick the chair right down under me 
Leave me hanging alone in misery 

Kick the chair right down under me 
Leave me hanging alone in misery
