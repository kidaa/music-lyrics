You keep on sayin' that you don't like my playin'
You can deal the cards anyway you want honey
You can roll the dice you can roll it twice
Better leave love on its own device

I wasn't born under the lucky star
I'm a gambler love's the game
I'm gonna get you no matter what it takes

LADY LUCK
You're a lipstick junkie
LADY LUCK
You made me a love-sick monkey

Play your cards smarter throw your dice harder
You're playin' for high stakes doncha realize it honey
Lucky's so blind and we're runnin' out of time
Wheel of fortune stops in you in my one-track mind

I wasn't...

[Chorus]
