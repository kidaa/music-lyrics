She got a sweet funky power machine
Shinin' chrome if you know what I mean
Speedin' the ride up to 99
Drive me on baby thru the 'lectric nite
Like a sweet ass-kickin' love machine

GOIN' DOWN ON THE DEMOLITION DERBY
Straight outta Hell
GOIN' DOWN ON THE DEMOLITION DERBY
Honey you can tell yeah

Well she rides like a motor-psycho speed queen
Hell on wheels if you know what I mean
Piercin' the nite down on the 69
Drive me on baby at the speed of light
Like a sweet supersonic sex machine

[Chorus]
