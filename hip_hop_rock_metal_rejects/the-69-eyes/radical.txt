It's not the morning
it's not the dawn
the daylight savings reminds me of the fall
I'd like to stay here all night long
but the time is near
and the summer's almost gone

Don't ask me why
I don't want to feel like forever young anymore
just catch my fall before I crawl on the floor

It's not the morning
t's not the dawn
the daylight savings reminds me of the fall
I'd like to stay here all night long
but my time is near
and my summer's almost gone

Don't ask me.... 

Is it so radical - after all
