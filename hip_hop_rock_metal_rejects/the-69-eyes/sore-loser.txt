Down to the wire down on me
Down to the wire you're down on me
I can see for miles whatcha trying to achive
You just can't hide your jealousy

YOU'RE A SORE LOSER
YOU'RE A SORE LOSER
YOU'RE A SORE LOSER
[x2]

Get outta my face you're getting under my skin
Get outta my face you're getting under my skin
Get a life you're just a thorn within
Honey i don't mind i dig you up with a pin

YOU'RE A SORE LOSER
YOU'RE A SORE LOSER
YOU'RE A SORE LOSER
[x2]

Speak of the devil and speak of the nun
You think you're both but you ain't none
Just fire upon your wicked tongue
WHY DON'T YOU SWALLOW A RAZORBLADE IF THAT'S YOUR KIND OF FUN?
