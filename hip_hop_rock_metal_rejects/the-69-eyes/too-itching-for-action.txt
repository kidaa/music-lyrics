I saw her down smilin' there
A sweet seducer w/ a dark black hair
After the show she wants to know
The place our band would go
To young but so tough
She'll make it where she is
No excuses no refuse
I like the game where I can't lose
SHE'S TOO ITCHING FOR ACTION
SHE'S TOO ITCHING FOR ACTION
she saw me up flirtin' there
a love dictator w/ a dark long hair
after the show I want to know
the place she would go
not too young but so cool
I'll make it where I am
No excuses no hesitation
I'm in the game where I can't lose
I'M TOO ITCHING FOR ACTION
I'M TOO ITCHING FOR ACTION
There comes the time that you should realize
That every drop of your love is a sacrifice
Oh yeah that's the hardest part of it
Now baby...
