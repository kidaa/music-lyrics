But your tears are not mine 
Still sailing down on them till the end of time 
All your fears still bleeding 
Out of your heart down on the sealing 
But you are what you believe in 
Come rain or shine in your garden of weeping 
still you keep on seeking the celebration of your evening 

but Your tears are not mine 
I don't care if I die 
As long as I can have you by my side 

But your tears are not mine 
Still sailing down on them till the end of time 
All your fears still bleeding 
Out of your heart down on the sealing 
But you are what you believe in 
Come rain or shine in your garden of weeping 
But we keep on seeking the celebration of your evening 

but Your tears are not mine 
I don't care if I die 
As long as I can have you by my side 
All forgotten is gone 
To sing this lonely song 
Things just happen without no reason 
Love's a stolen season
Love's a stolen season

but Your tears are not mine 
I don't care if I die 
As long as I can have you by my side 
All forgotten is gone 
To sing this lonely song 
Things just happen without no reason 
Love's a stolen season
baby, love's a stolen season

but Your tears are not mine 
I don't care if I die 
As long as I can have you...
