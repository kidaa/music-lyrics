i'm crawlin' back to you like a rattlesnake i've got poison runnin'
thru burnin' down alive without you my dear things
i've left behind make me want to disappear surrender
now lay down your arms girl can't you see for you
i've been kicked around the world fallin' back on you
don't you believe everything i've said is true burnin'
down alive without you my dear things i've left behind
make me want to disappear no use tryin' to get your sorrows drowned
don't you know they just learn to swim
