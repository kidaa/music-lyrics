let me tell you about the night of all the things
that you hide inside for in the blood that rushes red
all of life's secrets can be read no use cryin' out
i'll show you what hoodoo's about dig up the fear
that drags you down baby let me see you drown
let me tell you about the night of dark passion
that shuns the light don't you hold it back the deepest flame burns
always black it ain't hand of god crushin' your heart
let me tell you about the night where angels dance and angels die
i'm gonna get you little girl show you some underworld
no use cryin' out fear no evil that the night's all about
and don't you try to hold it back the deepest flame burns
always black it ain't hand of god crushin' your heart bleed me a river
