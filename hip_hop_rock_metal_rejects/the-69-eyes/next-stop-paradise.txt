never promised you miracles baby i only wanted to be with you
tryin' to get over it is makin' me crazy i never thought you could be so cruel
whatever happened to the promises baby we made each other
that night tryin' to get over it is makin' me crazy
if love's an angel you're a devil's spice burnin' up and down
in my spine show me the angel i saw in your eyes 'fill my last desire
and the next stop's paradise what did you want what you wanted
from me baby why did you throw my heart away tryin' to get over
it is makin' me crazy i never thought i could burn in flames
where could i find me a strong enough poison to wash down
this hurtin' pain tryin' to get over it is makin' me crazy
if love's an injection you're the cheapest brown burnin' up and down
in my veins
