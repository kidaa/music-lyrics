Hey what's a matter with you
Why doncha dance or groove
Is it something in the air
Bless my soul but save your prayer
Life ain't feelin' real
When you're so down
Come outta your shell girl
Let's paint the town

Sometimes your life ain't a bed
Bed of Roses
When in Rome they say
You gotta do as the Romans do hey babe

C'MON C'MON LET'S GET IT OFF
C'MON C'MON LET'S GET IT OFF NOW
C'MON C'MON LET'S GET IT OFF
C'MON C'MON YEAH

Hey sugar watcha tryin' to do
Ain't ya gonna give the Devil his dues
Can't you hear what I say
Keep your motor movin' all the way - hey

Sometimes...

[Chorus]
