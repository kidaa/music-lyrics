I was born in sweet innocence
My mother raised me not to be like one of them
I still have the same blue eyes
But what i've become now makes my mother only want to cry

Every time i thought i've found
Someone special i've been brought much faster down
I have learned to accept
My life as it is and i've learned to forget

DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND
I'M A BROKEN MAN

I drift around fallen from grace
But i still belive that someday i will find my place
Maybe then i'll find you
Just tell me that you won't break my heart in two

DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND
I'M A BROKEN MAN
