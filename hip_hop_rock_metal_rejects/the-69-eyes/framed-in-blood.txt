would you give me the key to the empire of bliss gimme a substance to dismiss
everybody's searching 
for a difference everybody 's searching for deliverance gimme just another reason to
live things you can 
resis things you cannot they're just framed in blood would you give me redemption in
your kiss gimme 
something that I already miss everybody's searching for difference everybody is
searching for 
providence gimme just another reason to live things you can resist things you cannot
they're just 
framed in blood
