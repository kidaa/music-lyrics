well i'm truckin' on on a heavy load million miles
from home gotta movin' on all night long baby come along to hell
and back like a heart attack best ride you ever had
and i'm comin' to you gonna blow your fuse watcha gonna do
gotta get high and real loaded gotta get back to the gator
sweat blues gotta get high and real loaded livin' on the edge
in the dead man's shoes well i'm drivin' amok doggone's my luck
but i don't give a fuck and i'm feelin' mean bleedin' gasoline
would you lick it clean everybody needs dreams to ride on by
but what i need is to see my name shinin' on the neon lights truck on baby
