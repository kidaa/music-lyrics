You can see her whenever it rains 
From Rome to New Orleans dancing on the graves 
Burden by the heart she loves her sunglasses after dark 
And every single day her little life falls apart 
She's out to look so macabre and alone 
She's close to hook on her dying 

Just like a gothic girl 
Lost in the darken world 
My lil' gothic girl 
Darkerside jewel are your razor cuts for real baby 

You can see she's on her road to ruin 
Stigmata from crucifixion on her pale white skin 
Tribal pagan art she loves her tatooed egyptian mark 
And every single day her love will tear us apart
