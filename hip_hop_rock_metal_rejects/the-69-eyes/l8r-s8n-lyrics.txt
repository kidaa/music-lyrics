Hey big fat ass you ain't got no class
I know what i'm saying
I'm a real deal badassed white trash
I've done my praying
We'd better fix now the business straight
You know what i'm saying
I'll show you some evil baptized with hate
Have you done your praying

THE DEVIL IN MY HEART IS BURNING HIS WAY OUT
THE DEVIL IN MY HEART FEEL IT BURNING
[x2]

I'm ruling the roost in a bad bad mood
You know what i'm saying
I get even pissed on you my little wisefool
Have you done your praying

THE DEVIL IN MY HEART IS BURNING HIS WAY OUT
THE DEVIL IN MY HEART FEEL IT BURNING
