Baby baby baby let me pick your cherry
Go star-gazin' on yer back
To crack a Judy's teacup I'll give you a little upshot
Doncha say your mama's comin' back
I may be too upside down
On your dead-end street
But you've got that love so deep
It's gonna be a double-event for you and me

CAN'T GET THRU
2 SMASHED 2 TRASHED

I can't help myself born to raise hell
Doin' that bone dance much too well
Been to Mexico been to Jericho
Been so blind as a boiled owl
I can't feel no pain
Now I'm right outta my brain
Don't know the way back home
Likkered up and laid to the bone

[Chorus]
