What would there be as the river of sadness turns into sea 
Could there be another thousand stories like you and me 
Wanted a heart, wanted a soul 
More than anything else in this world 
But we are doomed our flesh in wounds 
I would never give in 

Just like the moon does 
We rise'n'shine'n'fall 
Over you that I rise'n'shine'n'crawl 
Victims aren't we all 

What would there be beyond the eyes of Brandon Lee 
Could there be a revenging angel left to bleed 
Wanted the truth, wanted the faith 
More than anything else in this world 
But we are doomed body and soul marooned 
I would never give in 

Just like the moon does 
We rise'n'shine'n'fall 
Over you that I rise'n'shine'n'crawl 
Victims aren't we all
