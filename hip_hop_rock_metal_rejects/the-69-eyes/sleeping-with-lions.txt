Said you wanted to feel 
Cold metal and hard steel 
But it cuts in too deep 
To see you doing your midnight creep 

Somebody hurts you so you're hurting me 
The only way it was meant to be 
As the lights of neon slowly dim 
I can read in flesh everywhere you've been 

Dreaming of silence of the gently rain 
Sleeping with lions in the temple of pain 

Said you wanted to steel 
A heart of soul and make a deal 
With the danger that you feed 
Don't like the monsters that you keep 

Somebody hurts you so you're hurting me 
The only way it was meant to be 
As the lights of neon slowly dim 
I can read i flesh everywhere you've been 

Dreaming of silence of the gentle rain 
Sleeping with lions in the temple of pain
