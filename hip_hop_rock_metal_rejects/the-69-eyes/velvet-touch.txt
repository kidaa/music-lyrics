The autumn came took you away 
I never expected you to stay 
Black tears falling in the cold rain 
I woke up one night into the darkest dream 
Your pretty ghost whispering to me 
Just one drop and I'll give you eternity 

I'm looking at you I'm looking for love 
Never get enough when push comes to shove 
Try look at me tell me what you see 
You let fantasy become reality 
when the night is calling pretty baby screams 

I buried my heart into the deepest seas 
When the blood runs cold I feel hot in heat 
the red moon rising over you and me 

I'm looking at you I'm looking for love 
Never get enough when push comes to shove 

I never believed we would meet again 
Start it all over till the very end 
Gimme velvet touch 
Gimme a kiss of death
