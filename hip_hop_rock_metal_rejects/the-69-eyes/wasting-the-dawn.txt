been runnin' away so long from the day into the strange night of stone
to fade away as the light is gently bleedin' out of my soul
penetratin' the evening as i ride on this endless road
but you can't turn back the time it always gonna wait on the line
some may wish never to be born wastin' the dawn like a rose growin'
from the christ's thorn wastin' the dawn been waitin'
for you so long little bird of prey to fly me higher
to the brighter day where the lizard lingers long
under the sun forgettin' the night darkest july paris '71
