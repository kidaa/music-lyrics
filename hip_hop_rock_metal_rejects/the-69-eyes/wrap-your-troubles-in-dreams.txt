So much heartache and pain
Always on my way
Living on
Living day by day
I got no future
I got no past
Jut going nowhere
Nowhere fast
How long does 4ever last
I'm not living in the past for you
I've gotta find my way thru
Life goes on without any breaks
Got it baby, what it takes
Dreaming on and on of better days
So many things to get done
Everyone's here a chosen one
We've got a long,, long way to come
I'm not living in the past for you
I've gotta find my way thru
Just wrap your troubles in dreams
It ain't that hard as it seems
