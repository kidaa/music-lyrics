HEY! HEY! SUGARMAN!
By the time it gets borin'
Hangin' around 'n' doin' some whorin'
By the time you have lost yer pearls
Accusin' all those selfish girls
HEY! HEY! SUGARMAN!
By the time it gets dirty
Hangin' around 'n' bein' so filthy
By the time doctors know ya well
Askin' to use rubber cell
HEY! HEY! SUGARMAN!
