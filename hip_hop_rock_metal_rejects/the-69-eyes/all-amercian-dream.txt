On the edge of the world 
where the neon screams 
diet-coke religions 
shotdown tv-screens 
american boy loves american girl 
most beautiful people 
in the shattered world 
i do believe 
in all-american dream 
i do believe 
in all-american dream 
on the edge of the world 
where the freon streams snortin' up 
white mountains in the pools 
of white limousines 
millenium boy millenium girl 
most beautiful people 
in this shattered world 
i do believe 
in all-american dream 
i do believe 
in all-american dream 
in god we trust 
in cars we rust 
and i do believe in all-american dream
