Well i can't afford to bleed 
my blood is purest speed 
born from a restless seed 
on the gypsy road that's me 
well your chance is fifty and four 
to realize my score 
nothin' to tie me down 
i'm cheaper than a drug hound 

well i don't need you no more 
i just can't wait 
to say to you goodbye today 

well i can't tell you thousand lies 
the difference is in the eyes 
this life is built on sin 
it's deeper than the shit we're in 

well i don't need you anymore 
i just can't wait 
to say to you goodbye today 
no way 
you ain't the reason to stay 
no way no way
you ain't the reason to stay 
no way no way
you ain't the reason to stay 
no way no way
you ain't the reason to stay
