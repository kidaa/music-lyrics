So you like the evil and the ghosts
demon spirits more than most
little miss spookiness
loves to get scared to death
how could I ever forget
halloween we met

Don't turn your back my dear
never turn your back on fear
don't turn your back my dear
never turn your back on fear

never

So you like the evil and the ghosts
demon spirits more than most
little miss spookiness
always laughing at the death
how could I ever forget
halloween we wed

Don't turn.....

Am I not scary enough for you

Am I not scary enough for you 



Don't turn.....
