So much heartaches and pain
Always on my way
Living on living day by day
I got no fortune i got no past
Just going nowhere nowhere fast
How long does forever last

I'm not living in the past for you
I've gotta find my way thru

Life goes on without any breaks
I got it baby what it takes
Dreaming on and on of better days
So many things to get done
Everyone's here a chosen one
We've got a long long way to come

I'm not living in the past for you
I've gotta learn my way thru
Just

WRAP YOUR TROUBLES IN DREAMS
It ain't that hard it seems
