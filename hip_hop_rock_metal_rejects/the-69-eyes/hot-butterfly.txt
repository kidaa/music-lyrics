my girl wears a flower in her hair
her cookies make the cruel world disappear
the way she moves gives me the cicadelic illusion
she's hot hot hot butterfly
YOU GOTTA MOVE BABY
YOU GOTTA MOVE TO THE GROOVE NOW
mother nature takes care of her child
we're the children of freedom you can join us anytime
take my hand babe and let your mind run wild
she's hot hot hot butterfly
YOU GOTTA MOVE BABY
YOU GOTTA MOVE TO THE GROOVE NOW
I was walkin' on my bended knees
I was drunk 'n' seein' things
Like the warmth comes with the rising sun
She brought me the avalance of love
