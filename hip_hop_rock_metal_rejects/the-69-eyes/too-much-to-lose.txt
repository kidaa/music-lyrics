Nothing's here easy
Nothing's here clean
You gotta take what you can get
Life is for real
No more sympathy
No more humanity
Streets give and streets take
Tomorrow comes every day too late
I know we'll meet again
Street walking cheetahs at the world's end
I got too much to lose
To lose with you
Tachnology and satellites
No one gets outta here alive
A new star comes out in the sky
Crazy diamonds, they never ever die
I know we'll meet again
Street waling cheetahs t the world's end
I got too much to lose
