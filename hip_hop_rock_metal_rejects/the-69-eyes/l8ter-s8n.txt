Hey big fat ass
You ain't have no class
I know what I'm saying
I'm a real ceal badassed white trash
I've done my praying
We better fix now the business straight
You know what I'm saying
I'll show you some evil
Baptizised with hate
Have you done your praying
The devil in my heart
Is burning
I'm ruling the roads in a bad, bad mood
You know what I'm saying
I get even pissed on
You my littel wise fool
Have you done your praying
The devil in my heart
Is burning his way out
The devil in my heart
Feel it burning
