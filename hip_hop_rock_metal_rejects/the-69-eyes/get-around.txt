You've got a savage look in your eyes pretty little stranger girl
Too late to turn away you dragged me into your underworld
I think you've got your reasons
To carry a gun with you

DON'T YOU TRY TO BABY PUT ME DOWN GET AROUND
[x2]

Would you give a minute in heaven for a lifetime in hell
What's your price for eternity girl i know you've got a soul to sell

I think you've got your reasons
To carry a gun with you
if you ain't got better to do

DON'T YOU TRY TO BABY PUT ME DOWN GET AROUND [x2]
