Do you know the feeling 
When you wake up find your way to the bathroom 
Stare at yourself from eye to eye 
Feeling relieved the innocence is still there 
Time to turn over baby 
Time to turn loose 
No limits no lines 
That's yesterdays news got a rhythm in my rhyme 
Still shootimg up so high 
Got a ritual crime but I ain't no slave of time 
It's just like waking up from the strangest dream 
All the sudden 
All the people at your own age 
Are gone got fat familiazed and wrecked 
You're like the last of the lost boys of neverever land 
That's it 
Time to turn over baby time to turn loose 
No limits no lines 
That's yesterdays news got a rhythm in my rhyme 
Still shooting up so high 
Got a ritual crime but I ain't no slave of time
