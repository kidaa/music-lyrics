Down by the riverbank in the old bayou 
I'm digging a grave into mud just for you 
And the hardest rains always come from Tupelo 
The hardest rains always come from Tupelo 
Blinded by the moonshine from Mexico 
I'm singing my blues waiting for the death row 
And the hardest rains always come from Tupelo 
another dead baby born in Tupelo 

Do you believe in god do you believe in Jesus Christ 
Have mercy on me lord I must have been blind 
Got a beast inside that I sometimes just can't hide 
When the wolfsbane blooms and shadows come alive 
Death will be my bride
