Don't deny you're walking with the beast
no place to hide where the creatures meet kicking back evil, kicking back the night
run through the jungle like a real wild child 
don't rely on walking with the beast
and the creatures they feast 

I can't get no higher than this 
rising up horizon baby 
get real 

I don't need no heaven or hell 
but it's alright 
as long as you're in my heart 
I don't need no heaven or hell 
but it's alright 
as long as you're under my charm 

don't deny you're walking with the beast 
No grace to shine where the creatures meet and they feast 

I can't get no higher than this 
rising up horizon baby 
get real 

I don't need no heaven or hell 
but it's alright 
as long as you're in my heart 
I don't need no heaven or hell 
but it's alright 
as long as you're under my charm
