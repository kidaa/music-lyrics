Everytime you need me.
I'll be there for you.
Showing out no mercy 'til the fire's been burning thru.
Sailing down all the evening.
Until the river ends.
Just a calm before the storm.
On the sea of love my friend.

Maybe I just can't help.
The way I should or will.
Maybe I just can't no more resurrect my heart.
Just like before.

I wish I could remember.
The first moment and day.
To live it again all over.
Never let it go, never slip away.
Should I just forget now?
How does it feel like then?
What if I never had the chance to be in love again?

Maybe I just can't help.
The way I should or will.
Maybe I just can't go on,
when all your love is gone.
Maybe I just can't help.
The way I should or will.
Maybe I just can't no more resurrect my heart.
Just like one thousand times before.
