Hey skanky man
Tell me how you can watch me go to sleep
In a garbage can
Hey skanky man
Tell me how you sleep
Is your conscience clean
Do you rest real deep
Skanky man
Do you think it's fair you play your part
Cause you just don't care
Skanky man
I don't do dope
I'm already down
At the end of my rope
Trust me I ain't no criminal
Trust me you got it all wrong
Trust me, nothing to hide
Trust me, all I've got is my pride
Skanky man
Tell me where to go
Cause time on the streets
Passes oh so slow
Skanky man
It is a real nightmare
Do you think it's fair
Do you think you care
Skanky man
Ireally envy you
Is your wife pretty
Does she love you
Skanky man
For a dollar a day
You can make a difference
So what do you say
Trust me
