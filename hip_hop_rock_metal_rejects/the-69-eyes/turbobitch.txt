Did you know that i was born speedbound
Burning up the road faster than sound
She's got the power the power that i need
Goota keep on moving on full speed

T.U.R.B.O. gotta go
T.U.R.B.O. it ain't slow
T.U.R.B.O. gotta go
T.U.R.B.O. fucking turbo

Gimme speed bikes booze and dames
The all-american speedway right down into flames
On the freeway to hell with my customized
My v-8 baby keeps me downright satisfied

T.U.R.B.O. gotta go
T.U.R.B.O. it ain't slow
T.U.R.B.O. gotta go
T.U.R.B.O. fucking turbo

I GOTTA GET MY KICKS WITH THE TURBOBITCH
[x2]

C'mon get your kicks on Route 666
