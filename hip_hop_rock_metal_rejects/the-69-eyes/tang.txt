Hey you uptown jam-house mama
Such a superfly
Days go in dusty dreams
Nights with Doctor White
C-jams in Cadillacs
Help you to get your wings tonite
Number 3 takes to paradise
With the genuine snowbird eyes

I could see really easily
You got a monkey on your back
You ain't no better than a rat on crack
I could see really easily
Your tang is hungry
So hungry for that
Nose-candy, nose-candy

How to make your love come down without
Sonic dynamite
White girl you've gone too low
School boys callin' you Lady Snow

I could see...

[Chorus]

I can tell ya whatcha wanna
You're an uptown mama

Wanna-wanna-wanna
Superfly mama
