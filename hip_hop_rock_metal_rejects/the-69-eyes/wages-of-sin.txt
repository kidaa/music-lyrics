Fall into oblivion with me my love 
In the palm drunken night 
And stars above go west to the desert land 
The wind is like an invisible hand 
Get a gun and be a man 

Oh yeah and don't you never ask the reason 
Why bad world American so sad world l'American 
Hold me and never come again 
In the bad new world ain't no wages of sin 

Enter oblivion like a rai from the sky 

And don't you never ask the reason 
Why bad world American so sad world l'American 
Hold me and never come again 
In the bad new world ain't no wages of sin
