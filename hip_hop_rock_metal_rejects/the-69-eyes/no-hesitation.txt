I was flyin' in the extreme
On that Saturday nite eve
I got chicks on both sides
But the one I wanted couldn't deside
Tell me little sister tell me sweet lady
WHAT IS THAT YOU WANT FROM ME
There ain't no easy way
If you choose me don't hesitate
Just enjoy my magic ride
Baby let's bump 'n' grind
Tell me little sister tell me sweet lady
WHAT IS THAT YOU WANT FROM ME
i don't need NO HESITATION
i just don't like your old fashion ways
There ain't no easy way
If you choose me don't hesitate
Just enjoy my magic ride
Come over here child
let's bump 'n' grind
[etc]
