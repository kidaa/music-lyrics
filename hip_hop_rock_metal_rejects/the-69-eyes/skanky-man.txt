Hey skanky man tell me how you can
Watch me go to sleep in a garbage can
Skanky man tell me how you sleep
Is your conscience clear do you rest real deep
Skanky man do you think it's fair
You play your part 'cos you just don't care
Skanky man i don't do dope
I'm already down at the end of my rope

TRUST ME i ain't no criminal
TRUST ME you got it all wrong
TRUST ME nothing to hide
TRUST ME all i've got is my pride

Skanky man tell me where you go
'cos time on the street passes oh so slow
Skanky man it's areal nightmare
Do you think it's fair do you think you care
Skanky man i really envy you
Is your wife pretty does she love you
Skanky man for a dollar a day
You can make a difference so what do you say

TRUST ME i ain't no criminal
TRUST ME you got it all wrong
TRUST ME nothing to hide
TRUST ME all i've got is my pride
