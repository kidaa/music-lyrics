i'm tryin' hard to reconstruck my broken-hearted brain
i've been cut baby i've been shot first time ever
i'm goin' insane i can tell you what it's all about
to twist the devil's tail it's alright 'til the flames come out
and you gonna burn like a fucker who's gonna pay the bail?
yeah i'm tryin' to get over you hey babe
yeah i'm tryin' to get over you hey babe the action starts
like a sonuvabitch on a 2-horn head no remorse dial 666
should've stayed suckin' 8-balls instead
