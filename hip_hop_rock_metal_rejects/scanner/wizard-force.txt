Eternal life man's all time desire
This time I feel like a winner
I don't cling to the past the bad times have gone
Bound by the spell of the wise
My heart is full of energy
Cured by holy mystery

I've got the might to trace all evil
In every shadow it hides
Balance of power my aim has come clear
Salvation from stars is in sight
My heart is full of energy
Cured of holy mystery
One day I'll be backBound by the spell of wizard gods
They turned the bad into good
Won't die powered by wizard force
They changed my life and my mind

Planet of rock never known it before
A real that will be top secret
The only guarantee for man to survive
A headquarter of destiny
My heart is full of energy
Cured by holy mystery
One day I'll be back
I never knew it before
