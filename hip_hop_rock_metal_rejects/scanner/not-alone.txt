There'll be times
When we'll conquer the sky
We'll fly to every star
As ambassadors

We'll be a few
Out of a million minds
For the first encounters

We are not alone
They watch us and hear our voices
We are not alone
We have no choiceWe can reach
Out for eternity
Where other creatures live
Somewhere in the endless space

We believe
In our holy right
To be the only one
Unique God's creation
