When I started on this mission
There was no starlight
Now the rays are blazing in my face
I'm the spearhead of the team
That's waiting at my base
For the control of that distant ball

Roaring high on a silver streak
I know the task switching deflectors to ON

Like an eagle I descend
My intention is to scan
The whole success depends on my research
Data junction must be complete
I'm waiting for the right to send my creatures
Into universe

Roaring high on a silver streak
Thundering again

Warp Seven - a human body would have been torn
Warp Seven - a million times gale force tenWarp Seven!!!

I'm the bird of prey!

Still it feels like home, still I am a son
But I can't return though I'm the chosen one
If I touched the ground I'd lose all my might
Better enter space and dive into the sky

Roaring high on Warp Seven!
