He was a friend and was a foe
Sometimes high, sometimes low
A lion in fictitious realms
A childish hero - overwhelmed

Like the wizard of Oz
Part in the world of prose

The true-stories-teller was always the fool
He's often been blamed, he's never known rules
Gone now forever, he's telling no more
We wished we had listened before
They wished they had listened before

He made us laugh and furious, too
Never knew what's lies or truth
Superman in wonderland
Played the buffoon till the endLike the wizard of Oz
Part in a world of prose

The true-stories-teller was always the fool
He's often been blamed, he's never known rules
Gone now forever, he's telling no more
We wished we had listened before
They wished they had listened before

Like the wizard of Oz
Part in a world of prose

The true-stories-teller was always the fool
He's often been blamed, he's never known rules
Gone now forever, he's telling no more
We wished we had listened before
They wished they had listened before
