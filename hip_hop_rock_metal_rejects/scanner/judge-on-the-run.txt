Entrance to second main-floor
Pulse running high
The point of no return
Today is a nice day to die

Behind this green-grey wing door his fate was sealed
The judge who showed no mercy
Next case on his own battlefield

Access for lawyers only
Don't cross the painted line
Wait 'till your name's called over
Loaded gun
Judge on the runFor all they'd done to Billy
In years passed by
His life the worst disaster
Nobody who granted a trial

Access for lawyers only
Don't cross the painted line
Wait 'till your name's called over
Loaded gun
Judge on the run
