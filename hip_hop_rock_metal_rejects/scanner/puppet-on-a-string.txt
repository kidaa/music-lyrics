Everyone a child of the sun
But the gap is wide open yet
So we move straight to the might
Far to some demon's delight, I know

Some of them white
They always got right
How can they dare [that] there's nothing to share

And I do, no better than anyone else,
who's helping who, in any way
And I see, too many things not changed,
In a ";thousand-years"; time

Now I know, why I'm yearning
Cause life is never turning
Puppet on a string
Deliverance, roar for deliverance

And you know why I'm yearning
Cause life is never turning
Puppet on a string
Is a captive thing

Look this man is watching me
He's always been a part of me
And I see, left on the right
reflecting my body and soul, always

And I see, I look at myself into the mirror of time

Now I know why I'm yearning
Cause life is never turning
Puppet on a string
Deliverance, roar for deliverance

And you know why I'm yearning
Cause life is never turning
Puppet on a string
Is a captive thing

Save me, guardian of the poor
Watching every gamble, playing for high score

You may say I'm blind, right or wrong
Anywhere I belong
I can't deny, but my will ain't strong

All this fake
Sparkles out of gold
Did you ever die for
What your parents told

You may say I'm blind, right or wrong
Anywhere I belong
I can't deny, but my will ain't strong

Everyone a child of the sun
But the gap is wide open yet
So we move straight to the might
Far to some demon's delight, I know

Now I know why I'm yearning
Cause life is never turning
Puppet on a string
Deliverance, roar for deliverance

And you know why I'm yearning
Cause life is never turning
Puppet on a string
Is a captive thing
