I see a time
A time without hatred and riots
Sunrising cities where people can live without fear
This is why we have come right from the stars
Searching for answers that show
To stay alive
Listen, now we make you see
How you can survive

So we told
It's a place called Terrion
In a time of love and freedom
Such a place that we call Terrion
Can be real when mission is doneThere's a price for the world that we told
You must climb over the wall of hate
It is so hard to keep your anger down
Answer yourselves it will show, show the way
To stay alive
Listen so that you can see
How you will survive

It takes years for this world to unfold
You've gotta reach for the stars shining bright
Stand aside and lead the way
We must be sure that you find, find a way
To stay alive
Tell it so that we can hear
How you will survive
