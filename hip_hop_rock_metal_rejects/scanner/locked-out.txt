It's so serious
They destroyed all of us
All my comrades they have gone
I'll endure the pain
This hate I cannot tame
Sole survivor alone in space

I was changed to kill the enemy
But they launched me into space

Locked out - five lonesome years
Locked out - they don't know that I'm still here
Locked out - for 2000 days
Locked out - so much time to pray

Hear, our fate is just like yours
It's restrained by doubtful cures
We will help you to be free
To return and make them seeI deliberate
How I can infiltrate
All my vengeance must come true
No steel barricades
Could save 'em from my rage
Whole desire born of hate

Now I'm set free from non-gravity
And I must no longer stay

Locked out - five lonesome years
Locked out - they don't know that I'm still here
Locked out - still I'm alive
Locked out - so much time to build up my hate
