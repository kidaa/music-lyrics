Insanity surrounding me
Right beyond these walls
Dark corners where nurses shake the key
And quite near just behind my door
A soul leaves the corpse

I'll never accept all their reasons
What for they have done this to me
All dreams they are gone now to pieces
I'm in a mess there's no chance to flee
Why me

Forgotten prisoner they're wasting your time
Been on a mission here to create a sign
Your motivation was to change our world
Madness or genius apart
We start it tomorrowThe hate inside
Now part of me
Will burn my soul
And Jesus won't read out of my bones
So I try to get a chance
To get out of here

I'll never accept all their reasons
What for they have done this to me
All dreams they are gone now to pieces
I'm in a mess there's no chance to flee
Why me

Forgotten prisoner they're wasting your time
Been on a mission here to create a sign
Your motivation was to change our world
Madness or genius apart
We start it tomorrow
