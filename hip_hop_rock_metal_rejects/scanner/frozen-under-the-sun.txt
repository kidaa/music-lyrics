So many ways to choose for walking
Which of this paths should I try
There is a man returning
Guess he has got a false trial

And when I ask him
Hey man, what's wrong
He smiles and answers:
I think this way's too long

Pushed and pulled at points of entry
Gateway of my chances
Back and forth - two steps, I weary
I'm frozen under the sunNow that I've walked a thousand life-miles
Some of those miles I regret
Next bifurcation's coming
Which of two ways is the best

And when I'm asking
Oh, Lord what's right
There ain't an answer
To have the choice means fight

Pushed and pulled at points of entry
Gateway of my chances
Back and forth - two steps, I weary
I'm frozen under the sun
