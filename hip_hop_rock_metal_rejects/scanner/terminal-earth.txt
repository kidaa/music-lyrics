Our mission is done
And our time has come
All the stars are calling us back

But we can't leave
Ever again
Our starship won't start anymore

Never again
Will we see our home
Never again our system
Our bodies have changed
And if we approached
Disintegration would start

Terminal Earth caught in a trap
Now we are caught
Terminal Earth caught in a trap
Can we survive
Terminal Earth caught in a trap
Now we are caught
Now we can save our minds and our hope
Can we survive on
Terminal EarthWe cam to prove
And to research
To tell people all about Earth

We've been so sure
We'd leave again
Now we are filled with despair

Forced to deal
With your life and your fears
Of poisoned waters and air
Afraid of death
In a nuclear war
Our journey has come to an end

On Terminal Earth caught in a trap
Now we are caught
Terminal Earth caught in a trap
Can we survive
Terminal Earth caught in a trap
Now we are caught
Now we can save our minds and our hope
Can we survive on
Terminal Earth
