Since we're talking, mainly upright walking
Proved true the difference of fire and ice
We've built a cardhouse waving if the wind blows
Lies may walk slowly, but they return as the truth

Tollshocked, I'm tollshocked

Black is the color of darkness and evil
White is the truth as an innocent child
Women think slow, while a man's driving speedy
All red-haired women love wild
What's up, what counts

Since we're talking, mainly upright walking
Proved true the difference of fire and ice
We've built a cardhouse waving if the wind blows
Lies may walk slowly, but they return as the truth

Tollshocked, I'm tollshocked

The pope's licking dirt on his airport-arrivals
Messages light years away from the truth
";So not use condoms"; he counsels the poorest
Believes he that they need the boost
What's up, what countsSince we're talking, mainly upright walking
Proved true the difference of fire and ice
We've built a cardhouse waving if the wind blows
Lies may walk slowly, but they return as the truth

Tollshocked, I'm tollshocked

Billy looks smart with his smile sweet as honey
Boris likes vodka much more than champagne
Manni fhrt Manta und bumst 'ne Frisuese
Red-Indians endure much more pain
What's up, what counts

Since we're talking, mainly upright walking
Proved true the difference of fire and ice
We've built a cardhouse waving if the wind blows
Lies may walk slowly, but they return as the truth

Tollshocked, I'm tollshocked
