They came down late at night
Like rain over the land
No one knew of their existence
If he read no tales

Caught our minds tied to our brains
With visible chains
When they met the men in grey
The contract had been signed

One day if they cross your way
Don't believe a word they say
They're not creatures of the day
Afraid to touch the light

Giving them no chance
To realize their plans
They want to rule the earth
By the fruits of work

You are not allowed to rest
First you have to pass the test
As long as your heart beats in your breast

Touch the light with your hands
You're the only one
Touch the light with your hands
Save the frozen time
Touch the light with your hands
You're the only one
Touch the light with your hands
Only you can save the timeTime will stop a certain day
That's the chance to find a way
Only Mr. Hora knows
How to stop their fights

If you meet the men in grey
Don't believe a word they say

Touch the light with your hands
You're the only one
Touch the light with your hands
Save the frozen time
Touch the light with your hands
You're the only one
Touch the light with your hands
Only you can save the time

Heads will be rollin'
When you touch the flower
They will decay to dust in this hour
One little girl
She can sweep all their power
Aside

Touch the light with your hands
You're the only one
Touch the light with your hands
Save the frozen time
Touch the light with your hands
You're the only one
Touch the light with your hands
Only you can save the time
