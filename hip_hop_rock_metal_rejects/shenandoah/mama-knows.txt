Me and Jimmy Crowder and a single cagarette
Crouched down in a stall out in the barn
Three puffs later we were sick as we could get
Prayin we'd get better before we got home
She saw me comin through the back door screen
I knew the minute that she looked at me

Mama knows, Mama knows
Sometimes I think she's got a window to my soul
Mama knows, Mama knows
Even when I think it doesn't show
Mama knows

Me and Becky Johnson ankle-deep in ocean waves
Pants rolled up and hearts out on our sleeves
Both needin more than either one of us could get
That first love left the sweetest memory
Fifteen and shy, didn't tell a soul
How is it Mama never has to be told

I wasn't home when Mama passed away
I didn't get to say I love you
But I've got this feelin'

Mama knows, Mama knows
Sometimes I think she's got a window to my soul
Mama knows, Mama knows
Even when I think it doesn't show
Mama knows
Mama knows
