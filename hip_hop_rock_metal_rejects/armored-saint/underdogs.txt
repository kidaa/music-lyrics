Yea your riches have finally reached an end
What you call substance I wouldn't recommend
You didn't gain the strendth that lies within
I'm here to snatch your soul the faithful ones don't pretend
Don't want to be some hero
You can bet your ass I don't give a damn
Never did deny I was human
I am what I am
Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
Yea I'm tired of you sneering at the top
Flaunting green paper items you just bought
When ability is highly overcast
I'll stick to my vow to make sure that you don't last
Don't want to be some hero
You can bet your ass I don;t give a damn
Never did deny I was human
I am what I am
Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
Out to fill my quest
No contest for the rest
Nothing left undone
The lame will fall from number one
Hell your riches have finally reached an end
What you call substance I wouldn't recommend
You didn't gain no strength that lies within
I'm here to snatch your soul the faithful ones don't pretend
Don't want to be some hero
You can bet your ass I don't give a damn
Never did deny I was human
I am what I am
Underdogs Underdogs
I am what I am Underdogs
Underdogs Underdogs
I am what I am Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
Underdogs
