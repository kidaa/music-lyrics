Hey would you hear me
The out of it kid wants to be accepted
Will you listen
Got my mail with a giant will
Now I got a bed made of ten-dollar bills
Always knew luck was on my good side
Now I'm laughing at you
No use trying to pry into my life
Now I'm laughing at you
What a laugh
Concealed guilt
Friends for life is your motto
Can't believe it
Sneaky move
Just been proved
Now it's your turn to take abuse
Always knew luck was on my good side
Now I'm laughing at you
Double dealer
I'm aware what you do
Foolish maneuver
I can see right through
Get away
Get away from me
Get away
Get away you leech
Always knew luck was on my good side
Now I'm laughing at you
No use trying to pry into my life
Now I'm laughing at you
Waitin' for me
See that I'm leavin'
