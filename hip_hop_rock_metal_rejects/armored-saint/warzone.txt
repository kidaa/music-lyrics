When I dream I see movies in my head
I always have the starring role
But the scenery is never quite clear
Cause the film is growing old
But I just roll them dice
And I pray for snake eyes
Lonely warzone
That I defend
Lonely warzone
My only friend
Insanity is the word I plead
Cause the trenches are all filled up
With the bodies of men who used to laugh with me
They just got shot like sitting ducks
But I just roll them dice
And I pray for snake eyes
Lonely warzone
That I defend
Lonely warzone
My only friend
It's a bloody fighting
How I feel it
It's a bloody fighting
Won't you yield it
But I just roll them dice
I keep on rollin
Lonely warzone
That I defend
Lonely warzone
My only friend
Lonely warzone
That I defend
Lonely warzone
My only friend
