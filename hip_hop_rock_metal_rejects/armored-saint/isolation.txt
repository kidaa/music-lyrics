In time we fly
In time we die
Oh--Oh--Oh
Know what it feels to be lonely
Don't know how it feels to be free
Reacting wild, some moody child
Don't know what's in store for me
Oh
Out in the cold
Isolation
Out on my own
Isolation
Out all alone
Up go the golden mast
Float out to sea at last
Roamed a thousand miles
Still lonesome child
But my ship is comin' in
Oh
Out in the cold
Isolation
Out on my own
Isolation
Out all alone
It's my test
No fight with myself
I ain't wrong
It's my quest
A life with myself
I am gone
Oh yea
Isolation
Oh yea
Isolation
Out in the cold
Isolation
Out on my own
Isolation
Out in the cold
Isolation
Out on my own
Isolation
Out in the cold
Isolation
Out on my own
Isolation
Out in the cold
Isolation 
Out on my own
Isolation
Out in the cold
Isolation
