Colombian cartel
Coca paste potent smell
Boats off for San Pedro
Good work men! Bring my dough
Tribal dance
Tribal dance
It's a full moon yeyo de coca
Son of a milacka
Give me money then we'll do the tribal dance
Distribute USA
Demand is high today
Coffee beans were our trade
But the market
Prefers cocaine
Tribal dance
Tribal dance
It's a full moon yeyo de coca
Son of a milacka
Give me money then we'll do the tribal dance
Waiting for you
Come dance with me
That's the motto of the biggest party
Major supply
Families cry
When you gonna wake up open your eyes
The imported good is making America die
Rich Colombian man
Builds a zoo on his land
As long as we crave more
He'll dance
And win the drug war
Tribal dance
Tribal dance
It's a full moon yeyo de coca
Son of a milacka
Give me money then we'll do the tribal dance
