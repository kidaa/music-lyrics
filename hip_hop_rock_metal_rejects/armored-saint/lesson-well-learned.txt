A chance a risk try my luck again
Well this could be my win
I knew it was a lie knew it all the time
But I got sucked in
My crying for leaving was all misconceiving
now where can I turn
Without getting burned
I dealt with it fought it without any help
My fear is now gone
Battled and conquered now I'mup front
To sail through the dawn
My crying for leaving was all misconceiving
now where can I turn
Without getting burned
Ohh..it's  a lesson well Learned yea!
lesson well Learned yea!
lesson well Learned yea!
