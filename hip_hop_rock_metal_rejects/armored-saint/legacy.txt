Millions of years ago
Utopian life arose
Through my prolific eyes
Watched my equals grow
To a mess
They failed the test
But life was already conceived
Nothing he could retreive
Rolled out a second batch
And found they could repeat
Through a storm
I must reform
A legacy was made to warn man
The legacy has risen to warn again
Forty days of rain
Washed the ill away
Pairs of all living things
Stepped on ground to stay
Multiply
The land is dry
A legacy was made to warn man
The legacy has risen to warn again
A legacy was made to warn man
The legacy has risen to warn again
Hear the voice
Hear the voice
Noah cried he said
Breathe the air
But learn from my life time
Be aware
Prepare
Wrote down these special words
In hope they would be read
People of modern day
Can often be misled
Circumstance
We've got a chance
A legact was made to warn man
The legacy has risen to warn again
A legacy was made to warn man
The legacy has risen to warn again
Hear the voice
