Bureaucratic crap
Can't keep me humble
Money minded saps
Are takin' a tumble
Lies
Every word becomes a lie, lie
Lies
All the words you speak are bugging me
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Heard about your trip
In the Bahamas
Wrote and sent you a tape
But you don't want to bother
Lies
Every word becomes a lie, lie
Lies
All the words you speak are bugging me
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
On board I ride this world
It maes me wait
You don't say
Unspoken robots seniles
9 to 5'er make me a style
Give me a break
Lies, lies, lies
Bugging me
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Brain, pain, brain, pain
Brain, pain, brain, pain
Brain, pain, brain, pain
