Grasped by this certain thing
Expressing what I feel
Doin' it for my belief
Knowin' in my heart it's real
Mastermind won't let it stay
Givin' it his sentiment
You can put your thoughts away
Compromise ain't what was meant
Who gave you
The right to choose
Tell you why I'm here today
Never ever gonna lose
Make a believer
Out of you
Make a believer
What will you do
I know that I'm the only one that
Needs to prove it to myself
I don't need to fix your mind
It's already added to my wealth
Make a believer
Out of you
Make a believer
What will you do
What will you do
