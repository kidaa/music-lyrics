I realize
That my life tonight
Must deal with fate
Painful
Dwelling
I can't fight the feeling
I won't hold a grudge
I'll face the hanging judge
No reason to stall
You might as well call
The hanging judge
I have a soul
That's been lost in the climb
Too many times
Painful
Dwelling
Only left wondering
I won't hold a grudge
I'll face the hanging judge
No reason to stall
You might as well call
The hanging judge
I emphasize
That my final goal
Has been made
Painful
Dwelling
Hear my voice yelling
I won't hold a grudge
I'll face the hanging judge
No reason to stall
You might as well call
The hanging judge
The hanging judge
The hanging judge
You might as well call
The hanging judge
