You got yours
Baby I got mine
We just can't seem to make ends meet
Don't you realize when jumpin' in the water
You're gonna get wet past knee deep
Give in
Give and take
Taken by mistake
Sooner or later deceit's gonna hit
Lay your cards on the table and draw
From now on
I call the shots
Long before I die
Long before I die
Give in
Give and take
Taken by mistake
From now on
I call the shots
Long before I die
Long before I die
