Hide
Revived the pace He's got your number
With all your peers you're going down
Rabid Heady instinct
Ransacked and can't be found
Skulk inside the shadow
The concious mind won't let go
No one hears you
Then you disappear
Warn with a threat
Bow, down here
Cause the saint's Raising Fear
Everything has gone haywire
A sneak attack is going down
Bringer of bad news
Has come to spoil your pleasant mood
No one hears you
Then you disappear
Warn with a threat
Bow, down here
Cause the saint's Raising Fear
I said, bow, down here
Cause the saint's Raising Fear
Rebuilt your face you've got to wonder
Why all your fears are still around
Rubbed the wrong way
Ranked one way
Here to control your life
No one hears you
Then you disappear
Warn with a threat
Bow down here
Cause the saint's Raising Fear
I said bow down here
Cause the saint's Raising Fear
Raising Fear, Raising Fear
