You keep actin' the way you do
And soon you'll be out the door
I wont take things so mildly
I'll turn you into a morbid gore
Roughneck
Totally sick
And full of sadistic whims
I didn't come here to sing a song
or whistle a pretty hymn
Although you feel calm
You've sunk into a deadly realm
You're never alone with a madman on your trail
Scream as loud as you like
Or enjoy the fatal knife
Whatever your choice
There ain't no chance for bail
Terror thoughts and terror ways
keep me full of sin
I'd love to bury you alive
Bury you six feet in
Whatever is your preference
Make up your mind fairly fast
Sorry to say it honey
But your ass ain't the last
Still you're feelin' safe
Got no reason to be afraid
You're never alone with a madman at all
Think about what I said
Then think real hard again
By that time my switchblade's in your skin
See
Didn't you believe
Id carry out these plans
Killin' little ladies
Makes me feel more a man
If I quit the occupation
There's nothin' left to do
But as long as I stick to my job
I'm killin' more of you
I know you feel calm
You've sunk into a deadly realm
You're never alone with a madman at all
Think about what I said
Then think real hard again
See your blood splash against the wall
Get on out
Run and hide
No escape from here
My silver blade
Will slice you from ear to ear
Oh aren't you hoping
I might save you from death
I wouldn't hold my breath
No
You're never alone
