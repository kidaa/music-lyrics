Voted in I'm just the spokesman here
A robot I'm not I feel the same fears
Pressure on my back and I must respond
Say the word and I'll be gone
I'm gone
I say attack while the world is trembling
Then get criticized cause we felt the sting
An indecisive mind cannot be a judge
Stand by your fighting words
Your words
Everybody is a book of blood
Subverting society with a magic touch
Well I refuse to engage
Don't condemn the judgement of another
Cause it differs from your own
You may both be wrong
ssure on my back and I must respond
Say the word and I'll be gone
Gone, I'm gone
No end
No friend
No end
Defend
