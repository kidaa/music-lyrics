Honor abide
Choice of words
That I speak today
Consequent Evidence
Now they put astray
Conflicts forever halt
Wipe resentment clean
No thoughts of decadence
Life is now serene
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
Again it's none for this
None for that
Can we share alike
Positive identity
Creates the oversight
Never erase the light in man
No more blockades
Warfare for at last
Are to soon about to fade
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
It's taken years to mend
Can't take the high hell
Can't change the way they feel
Honor abide
Choice of words
That I speak today
Warfare for at last
Are soon about to fade
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
Again 
It's done
