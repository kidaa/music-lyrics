The cynical view that has been taken
Is blowing my mind
I can't seem to piece it all together
I guess it takes time to unwind
To let the dust settle
And let cooler heads prevail
Each and every day I rise
From the ashes I've left behind
To start anew push through
They say it's not meant to be
Well I'm parting the sea
Got to let go
Move on from a tainted past
I'll never know
Fall out from a tainted past
The selfish greedy world we live in
Is making me mad
It's always give me every marble
Then kiss my ass
Each and every day I rise
From the ashes I've left behind
To start anew push through
If you go for the green
You'll soon see what I mean
Got to let go
Move on from a tainted past
I'll never know
Fall out from a tainted past
Tainted past
Why should anyone finish last
Tainted past
You needn't be a saint
All you need is lots of cash
Why did it end this way
I'll never understand
Why my world is grey
When you combine heartache
With misery
Sets up a challenge
For destiny
Each and every day I rise
From the ashes I've left behind
To start anew push through
They say it's not meant to be
Well I'm parting the sea
Got to let go
Move on from a tainted past
I'll never know
Fall out from a tainted past
