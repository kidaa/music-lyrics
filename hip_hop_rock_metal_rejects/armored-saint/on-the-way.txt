Hold on to that vision
There'll always be some friction in your life
But you gotta keep your head high
and beat the odds with a sigh
my friend,
Keep pushin to the plateau
Find gold at the end of the rainbow, begin
Feel the sweet sensation
suddenly you've taken charge of your life
no  one can surpass
Feelinggood, you're on the road atlast
yes you're made of armor
and saints will conquer and you
ask what this thing could be
just jump on the road and follow me
I knew that one day I would reach you
and show you lives worth living for
sometimes you'll go through hell first
but at the end you'll be at heaven's door
Do you realize  your on the way
To an everlastingday
don't turn your head on the ones who placed your crown
