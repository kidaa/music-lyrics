The clouds roll in one by one
And the shapes seem to spell out caution
Many worries in my mind
Without too many options
I take a trip to soothe the pain
And get away from the problem
I'm near, sign reads clear
It's plain inside your cranium
Look at the speed you ran
You're just a nervous man
Too much for your own hand
Delirious Nomad
I find no end to this
Paranoid, well, perhaps a bit
But I am a spy
Loneliest guy
With no one to lean on
Look at the speed you ran
You're just a nervous man
Too much for your own hand
Delirious Nomad
Look at the seed you plant
Now you're a newborn man
Pounding with your right hand
Delirious Nomad
Delirious Nomad
