Weakness shines
Right off the teeth of your pathetic smile
Nerve is gone
The minute I turn my back the weasel runs
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless
Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless
Son of a bitch
Overthrow
They'll aim for the apple on your head but shoot too low
Say your prayers
Can't find room on this earth for you anywhere
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless
Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless
Son of a bitch
Spineless
Spineless
Spineless
Spineless fool
You are no exception to the rule
Heed these words
Stand up now or be the eternal nerd
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless
Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless
Son of a bitch
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless
Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless
Son of a bitch
