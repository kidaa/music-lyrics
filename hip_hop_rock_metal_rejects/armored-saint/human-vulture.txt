Daylight, lie asleep
I conserve desire
As I refuel the fire
Teethbites, in your neck
You become the gravy
Sufficed, money bet
Your last words were, "Save me"
May day, Pay day
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Cannibal
Another door's unlocked again
Easy meansI must disguise myself
To fill my veins
Keep that bloody stake away
Crosses burn my eyes
I plan to live another hundred years
Before I say goodbye
May day, Pay day
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Live human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Cannibal
May day, Pay day
Patiently I wait
Entice with the bait
Women can't resist
Eternal bliss
Stalking, once again
My body needs a refill
Surprise, you are next
The only sound is a shrill
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Live, human vulture lives
Cannibal
Out, out of the darkened mist
Cannibal
