When lonely winds blow cold
And my world moves down below
It's a sign to make a change
Among the platform crowd
Words clear as clouds
Say you can't remain the same
And familiar voices cry my name
I'm on the last train home
On the last train home
Crossroads of y life
Feel my body glide
To a place I need to be
It's within my sights
I know it'll feel so right
When I get there I'll be free
Still those voices call my name
But I'm on the last train home
On the last train home
On the last train home
Ride with the freight line
Ride with the freight line
There I go
Gotta make time
I gotta make time
I'm aboard
Boxcar wonder
Every scar shows
Where the future lies
Lord only knows
I'm on the last
Last train home
On the last train home
I'm on the last train home
On the last train home
I'm on the last train home
On the last train home
Last train home
Yeah, last train home
It's within my sights
I know it'll feel so right
When I get there I'll be free
