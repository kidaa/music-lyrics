Her painted stare
Her silky hair
Her ghostly glare
Burns holes everywhere
I waited long
I held out strong
One step beyond
On my mind all day long
I want to blame uncontrolled desire
It set my fury free
The level of my need shot up higher
Confused my mind guaranteed
She's a burning question
Does the answer lie up ahead
Burning question
The eternal flames fire red
My make believe
It made me leave
Had to achieve
Every part of her that breathed
I want to blame it all on obsession
It set my fury free
It's a fine line between possession
And smothering at the seams
She's a burning question
Does the answer lie up ahead
Burning question
The eternal flames fire red
It's got the shrewd man mesmerized
Perplexed and hypnotized
The rule of thumb sure ain't on the rise
Lost
Losing control
Raging up from my soul
Violence is in command
Her life is in my hand
Inside my hand
 I want to blame uncontrolled desire
It set my fury free
The level of my need shot up higher
Confused my mind guaranteed
She's a burning question
Does the answer lie up ahead
Burning question
The eternal flames fire red
It's got the shrewd man mesmerized
Perplexed and hypnotized
The rule of thumb sure ain't on the rise
Burning question
Burning question
Burning question
