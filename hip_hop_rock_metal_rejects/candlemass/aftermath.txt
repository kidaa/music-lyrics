Black inferno, chaos reigns supreme
a cancerous growth spreading out the dark
Leaving the wounded land in ashes
A civilization in ruins and decay
Whores and scavengers violating the dead
like a filthy flock of hungry wolves
Tortured shapes of steel against the sky
the eve of destruction, the final tragedy
Nothing left to admire
Nuclear war and the aftermath
Down in flames, a rain of fire
Time has run out
