Black heart, your soul is mine
gaze into and the secrets you'll find
Just read the signs
Gaze into the crystal
See what it tells
It can bring you all fortune
do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see in the
Crystal ball
I saw the rainbows end
I am raptured I cannot pretend
I have found Atlantis
The talisman of Seth
I have seen it all
dreamt away through the crystal ball
Tell me more I want to know
please hear my call
