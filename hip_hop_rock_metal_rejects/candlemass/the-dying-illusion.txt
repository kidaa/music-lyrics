From the bottom of the pit of nightmares she will come
from the dungeons of insanity to haunt the wicked mind
A crooked finger points, a spell is cast, words can kill
a weaver of the web of tears, a daughter of the dark
    Oh, the moon is so cold
    see the grace of her presence
Giving you the poisoned apple, beauty or beast
dancing naked in the rain with eyes that cannot see
Calling demons that have not spoken ina thousand years
old sad eyes of wisdom tell of dreams we can't reach
    When the moon is so cold
    when the air breathes of evil
    And the black skies will burn
    see her shadow is rising
    The dying illusion
    the loss of a friend
    The dying illusion
    please come back again
The hideous smile of the devils child will tease you to believe
a forbidding shape witch or virgin - over a sinister moon
Fatal grace that blinds and binds, assaults and astounds
from the cradle of eternity to the fears of modern man
    When the moon is so cold
    when the air breathes of evil
    and the black skies will burn
    see her shadow is rising
    The dying illusion
    the loss of a friend
    The dying illusion
    please come back again
