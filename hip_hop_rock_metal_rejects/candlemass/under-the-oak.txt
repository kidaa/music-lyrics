Deep was my anguish and for those words
they froze my blood and chained my soul
the master had spoken, the truth, not any lies
The devil gives and evil takes
the things in life that foresakes
a throne in hell, a price or a sacrifice?
Still the wind was blowing soft
and gentle here under the oak
which gave me shelter and rest for my trial
"I'm not strong, weak is my mind
a new biginning, where to find?
I'm the last one on earth, please forgive us our crime"
It was a time, when love was mine
now its time, to sacrifice
My heart, bleeding for my race
the traces of mankind was swept out by the hands of our lord
I cried, for the ones I had lost
Midnight in paradise, grief, away goes my hope
I cried for, the ones I had lost
"Hear my prayers, climbing on the clouds above
Silent cry, reach the inner halls of truth
Give me a sign!
A crimson sky, bless my eyes
up goes the sun, my time has come"
