Lyrics by Leif Edling
"Edge of time, the dawn of our heaven
all is black, the return of the fallen angel
amongst us, a devil in disguise
the preacher of the wicked
establishing his kingdom"
A million souls so lost and damned
alive but not so well
and the devil raised his hand
and sent them down to hell
Just like your father held your hand
he's watching over his creed
Damnation and death, they'll burn in flames
no matter how they plead
To you, coming for your soul
Just like a shepherd assembling his floack
this one rules hells domain
Satanic force, Lucifers power
attack, and he will reign
To you, coming for your soul
Into the night we will go
Into the night we will go
Out from the night he comes
saviour but black
"won't you come, come and join us?"
You had better!
There's no time to beg for mercy
the devil says no. no
You'll be his faithful servant
this time, on earth
Black is the devil, Antichrist
the Tempter damned your birth
Listen to the wicked, sell your soul
forever hell awaits
Into the night we will go
