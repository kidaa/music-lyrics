Suddenly I awoke, I must have fallen asleep under the oak,
where I used to sit and dream as a child
The dawn was soon to come, and the air was crisp and cold
Yet I felt warm
I remembered my strange dreams and knew I had the strength and
love in my heart to create something from my life. The world was waiting
I was reborn
