Let me stay here by your side
be one with you my precious child
Let me cover your bed with tears
I will save you from all fears
I burn the candles for your soul
I sing you prayers as the preacher told
I bring you flowers, I dress in black
though I know this cannot give you back
Chorus:
I sleep by your shadow
remembering your light
In my heart
I'm with you every night
Far goes your journey
into the unknown
wherever you might be
be well my son
Why just you my flesh and blood
I cannot live nor understand
my dearest treasures to be found
six feet under in sacred ground
Watch me bleed you lucky ones
I envy you your living sons
I'll give mine the strength of my faithful breath
I will mourn him to my death
