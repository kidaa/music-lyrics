Beyond all nightmares I met my fate
an ancient passage surrounded by hate
scared I was with my hand on my cross
I went into the demons gate
Across the Styx among the mists of Hades
a gate of stones marks the path
to soul's damnation and hell's wrath
Ancient evil is awaiting there
at the doorstep to hell
within it's darkness the demons dwell
From the dark age the passage hail
created by witchcraft and hate
where every sinner will meet his fate
The place is cursed by the hands of doom
unholy powers in reign
the devil's paradise of pain
Approach !
The Eibon opens for you
the choirs of damnation, call you on through
The twilight possesses, the heart of your soul
the starlight is fading to black, into the
Demons gate
