"Holy was the star from which you were born
to a world where darkness and fear take form
A lonely sould with a heart of light to find
beyond reality, forgotten in time
Seek the heart, seek in your dreams
visit your nightmares and realms yet unseen
You are alone, the last one to be
a representative for mankind to decide the final destiny
Will you be saved or will you stay blind
deep in your soul the answer you'll find"
The words were spoken, I cried in my hands
the bringer of wisdom, or the one who condemns
Can I succeed where the mighty have failed
and re-create the harmony from where salvation hails
