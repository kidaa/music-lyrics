The rain kept on falling and darkened the sky
the dawn was to come with the sunrise
Revealing the shadows that passed through the mist,
the torch light was flickering
the storm was chasing them on
A procession of dark coats followed the star
foretold to come since ages
In silence they walked on crossing their lands
on the way to Bethlehem to break the chains of the spell
Stone, they worshipped the stone
in generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
to light the way to the one who is born
The leader he knelt there to greet the new born
holding his pendant before him
tear drops were falling from his eyes as he said
"Take the stone and use it well
don't do as I did long ago"
Went into the sundown, never returned
The moon was rising and the heaven burned
Like shadows disappeared the men
and the black stone weilders were never seen again
Stone, they weilded the stone
in generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
to light the way to the one who is born
Black stone weilder is born
They came across the western sea
with powers greater than needed
The wizards commanded the lightning
every creature knelt before their will
But they weilded the black stone with evil
and their evil was cast back on them
Damned to praise God forever
till His son was born to deliver
Stone, they weilded the stone
in generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
to light the way to the one who is born
