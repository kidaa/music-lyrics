I'm standing here in silence
this grateful place of peace
watching the shadows come closer
The birds they sing no longer
the winds they blow no more
with fear of death I'm waiting for the night to fall
The sun will set forever
one after one they stars they die
the rainbow has turned to black
darkness has fallen in paradise
Love is lost in memories
all beauty and all light
have vanished from the garden of delight
The devil and his gift
the heart he stole away
but innocence was lost long ago
The morning will come no more
our dreams are all gone
midnight has come to stay
darkness has fallen in paradise
Oh father please forgive us
forgive us all our sins
please bring your light again to lead our way
but my prayers are not answered
they fade out to die
and so does the last gleam of hope
The morning will come no more
our dreams are all gone
midnight has come to stay
darkness has fallen in paradise
I know my death is near
far beyond my dreams
my fate is waiting
to show me the light ... I believe
