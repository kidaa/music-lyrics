My tears were flowing down to the ground
a sad stream of silver is a mournin' mans gold
And where the seeds of sorrow soon were found
a flower of light, the omen saw the world
Chorus: Step into the dreams of wonder
Open up the gates of wonder
Stare into the face of wonder
Free yourself from the spell you're under now!!!
I blessed the sign yes my prayers were heard
I laughed as I watched that tiny thing grow
Over the rainbow and up to the stars
A tower of dreams, waiting to come true
Chorus
I saw this divine gate between the worlds
waiting for me to take away my soul
I was no longer what I was before
A chosen one that opened up the door
Chorus
