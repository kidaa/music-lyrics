Julie's on the run so far away from home
a tiny little cottage in the woods
Hunting wolves are chasing this delicious mouse
where she went we never understood
    Nothing really matters anymore
    No Julie longer knocks on our door
    a fallen princess bends her head in shame
    in the end there's no one else to blame
    And she's falling
    falling without reach
    Julie's falling, lost in her dreams
    Afraid to go, afraid to leave
    Into the emptiness what there's to believe
Julie's on the beanstalk way up in the clouds
can't stop climbing, refuses to look down
the giant in his castle, laughs gives wonderous wows
she's cast into the stew without a sound
