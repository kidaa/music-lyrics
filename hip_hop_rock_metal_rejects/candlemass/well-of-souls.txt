I bind unto myself
today the stong name of the trinity
Crypt of despair
the old man is there
forming a circle of magic and prayers
Guarding the well
the black whole to hell
its evil must never arise I can tell
Holy mission
forever he's sworn
to protoect our world from hatred and scorn
He will not fear
though the Sabbath is near
twelve strokes for Candlemass darkness descends
Chorus:
"Break the circle and all hell comes loose
the well of souls must stay sealed
Ancient force of light against the dark
the well of souls must stay sealed"
Black wind turns out the candles
the air grows cold and threatening
Dark shadows wicked laughter
brings darkness to your heart
Behold the goat from Mendes
red burning evil eyes
Lord's prayer holy water
just faith can save you now
Disharmony, satanic serenade
Black symphony, a tribute to the plague
The twisted souls awakened by the chanting
Unchained at last, rise, they will now rise
A new days dawn, holy light
Sunlight redeems
slays the dark, warms and heals, makes you
see nightmares terror is back in your dreams
Sleep well my friend 'cause
the tale's now to end, don't
believe our world's as safe as we pretend
Chorus:
"Break the circle and all hell comes loose
the well of souls must stay sealed
Ancient force of light against the dark
the well of souls must stay sealed"
