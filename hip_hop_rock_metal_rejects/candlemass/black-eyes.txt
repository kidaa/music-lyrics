Every night outside my window, she is there
a frozen shadow in the street
Surrounded by silence and unspoken terror
hell on high heels
Demonic hunger, a mistress from the grave
welcome, she smiles
The poisoned smell of her sexuality
says love me to death
    I can't resist the fear
    her deadly demands
    Desires of the flesh
    what she commands
I cannot move, I cannot run, I cannot hide
hypnotized like a fool
Eyes of floating coal and dancing firelight
oh, hell's own delight
She has got me engulfed by her nature
a slave under her will
In her grasp she is boiling my blood
in for the kill
    I can't resist the fear
    her deadly demands
    Desires of the flesh
    what she commands
Black eyes, the crystals of fire are calling my soul
Black eyes, the burning desire is talking control
Oh no, what can I do. Can't resist ... those black eyes
