A distant calling, a faint echo from the past
the bells are still tolling, the message of sadness and death
In the city of Acheron
the priests burned the Book
worshipped false Gods
scoffed at the good
desecrated the altar
spat on the cross
teared down the temples
and laughed at their loss
of faith ... of faith
Stone by stone, the ringing goes on and on
attracting a memory, forgotten and nowhere to be found
Forged by the mighty
admired by the great
once blessed by the holy
protected* by fate
Announcing the twilight
the wrath of the Gods
the city of Acheron
was drowned by the flood
The bells of Acheron
* Abandoned 2nd verse
