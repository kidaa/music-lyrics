Part I
       Time stands still in these ancient halls
       Only the castle itself can tell what it keeps
       Dark are the secrets between these walls
       hidden in shadows of death, while the sorcerer sleeps
       Where is the morning
       where is the sun
       Thousand years of midnight
       the sunrise is gone
       An old man marked by a life so long
       Is sleeping so sweet while his magic is growing so strong
       Waiting still for new times to come
       a thousands years to see if he has won
       Where is the morning
       where is the sun
       A thousand years of midnight
       the sunrise is gone
Part II
       What has he done ?
       Why is he sleeping so long ?
       He wants to live for evermore
       Soon is he young
       When will he open his eyes ?
       When he is strong enough to rule
       Back in our time goes the legend
       of a sorcerer so old
       He drank the blood of the virgin to be reborn
       Soon a tyrant will conquer
       So spoke the wise
       of the day when the sorcerer will rise
       Blood is his wine
       The sorcerer is cheating on time
       and he'll be stronger than before
       Cursed be the sun
       the women will weep for his fun
       In the name of his magic so strong
Part III
       A thousand years have gone
       Armageddon hasn't come
       Only the cry of a child echoes in the dark
       Backwards goes time
       as the stars are passing by
       and nothing remains of this foolishman except his fate
.
