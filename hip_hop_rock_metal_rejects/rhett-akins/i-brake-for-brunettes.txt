Well I brake for brunettes
Blondes in Corvettes
Redheads I stop on a dime
Now the way I drive
It's a wonder that I
Ever get anywhere on time
So don't tailgate my pick-up truck
Or you just might wind up in a wreck
Now they ain't made the sticker for my bumper just yet but
I brake for brunettes

I let Firestone put me some new tires on
Just a few weeks ago
But man I swear that wear and tear
Is already startin' to show
Well I oughta just whistle or yell
But man I can't help myself

'Cause I brake for brunettes
Blondes in Corvettes
Redheads I stop on a dime
Now the way I drive
It's a wonder that I
Ever get anywhere on time
Don't tailgate my pick-up truck
Or you just might wind up in a wreck
Now they ain't made the sticker for my bumper just yet but
I brake for brunettes

You'll see them big skid marks by the wave pool park
And Judy's beauty salon
Lord I tore up the street in front of Betty's boutique
Where they come out with mini-skirts on
Well I know I'm gonna wear out my tread
Down by Tina's tanning beds

'Cause I brake for brunettes
Blondes in Corvettes
Redheads I stop on a dime
Now the way I drive
It's a wonder that I
Ever get anywhere on time
So don't tailgate my pick-up truck
Or you just might wind up in a wreck
No they ain't made the sticker for my bumper just yet but
I brake for brunettes
I brake for brunettes
Man I brake for brunettes
