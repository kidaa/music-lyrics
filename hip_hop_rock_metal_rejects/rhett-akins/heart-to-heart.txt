Mac McAnally/Chris Gantry/Rhett AkinsTrack 1 - Time 3:52
I pulled in her driveway
Turned the radio down low
And I sat staring at what she was wearing
Waitin' by the front door
She came walking down the porch steps
Her daddy's pride and only innocence
The way she smiled
I knew we were gonna be

Heart to heart
Falling in love by the radio light
Underneath the stars
Nothin's ever felt more right
Than being alone and lost
In each other's arms
Givin' in to the raging storm
And cherishing every part
Heart to heart

We pulled down a dirt road
Sittin' close and moving slow
The moonlight danced on a little romance
Goin' on in my old Ford
She whispered softly as she closed her eyes
If we go to far don't apologize 'Cause there's no place that I would rather be

Heart to heart
Falling in love by the radio light
Underneath the stars
No nothin's ever felt more right
Than being alone and lost
In each other's arms
Givin' in to the raging storm
And cherishing every part
Heart to heart

They say that we're too young
To know if love is real
But all we know is what we feel

When we're heart to heart
Falling in love by the radio light
Underneath the stars
Girl nothin's ever felt more right
Than being alone and lost
In each other's arms
Givin' in to the raging storm
And cherishing every part
Heart to heart
Falling in love by the radio light
Underneath the stars
Girl nothin's ever felt more right
