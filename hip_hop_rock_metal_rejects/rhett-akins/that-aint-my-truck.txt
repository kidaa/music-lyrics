She's been goin' out with him
She's been goin' out with me
Said she'd let us know by tonight
Which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was goin' on
So, I drove by her house -- and sure enough

That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl -- my whole world
But that ain't my truck

I pulled over by the curb
I've been sittin' here all night
Wonderin' what it was I did so wrong
That he did so right
I've thought of breakin' down her door
But there's nothin' left to say
That chevy four-by-four
Says it all sittin' in my placeThat ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl -- my whole world
But that ain't my truck

That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl -- my whole world
But that ain't my truck
That's my girl -- my whole world
But that ain't my truck
