Larry Boone/Paul Nelson/Rhett AkinsTrack 2 - Time 3:27
Stole the keys to my daddy's ride
And I took my baby for a midnight drive
Our hearts were racing as we headed down highway 9
We didn't have no lover's lane
But that old back road worked just the same
It wasn't long till I knew deep inside

This must be what they're talkin' about
When you find the one you can't live without
Somewhere deep in the night, I saw the light
Oh her love got a hold of me
Left no doubt
This must be what they're talkin' about

I read about it in the magazines
I'd even seen it on the movie screen
Heard 'em sing about it in a million songs
I never really understood
Till we lit that fire that night in the woods
Started a love that still burns just as strongThis must be what they're talkin' about
When you find the one you can't live without
Somewhere deep in the night, I saw the light
Oh her love got a hold of me
Left no doubt
This must be what they're talkin' about

Somewhere deep in the night, I saw the light
Oh her love got a hold of me
Left no doubt
This must be what they're talkin' about
This must be what they're talkin' about
This must be what they're talkin' about
This must be what they're talkin' about
