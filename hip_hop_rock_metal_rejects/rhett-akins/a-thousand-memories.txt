Byron Hill/Rhett AkinsTrack 7 - Time 4:21
I can curse the day I met you
And say I never loved you
Swear I'm better off now
That you're not here with me
I can tell myself it's over
That somewhere there's another
Who'll take your place in my life
But it's all just make-believe
I know it's all just make-believe

'Cause a thousand memories can't be wrong
One by one they're tellin' me to hang on
Truth is girl, I've loved you all along
No a thousand memories can't be wrongI don't need to see your picture
Or read your old love letters
To know the fool that I've been
I'm reminded all the time
I don't need to drive by your house
Or go to our old hangouts
To know the love I'm missin'
It's always on my mind
Girl you're always on my mind

'Cause a thousand memories can't be wrong
One by one they're tellin' me to hang on
Truth is girl, I've loved you all along
No a thousand memories can't be wrong
No a thousand memories can't be wrong
