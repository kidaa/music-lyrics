Make D. Sanders/Sam Hogin/Rhett AkinsTrack 10 - Time 3:28
She was a mom back when moms didn't work
She just did the laundry and brushed off the dirt
She cooked all the meals and scrubbed all the floors
And she mowed that front yard with that old push mower
All of those years without the help of a man
She held us together with those delicate hands

Those hands have rocked some cradles
Calmed many a cryin' child
Set ten thousand supper tables
Now it's time to rest those hands a while
Those hands have done some prayin'
Worn just one wedding band
Now there ain't much time
And there ain't much strength
But there's a lot of love left in those hands

If I had a dime for every button she sewed
All the tears she's dried and bedtime stories she's told
I'd buy back the years back from old father time
Just sit here and hold her hands in mine

Those hands have rocked some cradles
Calmed many a cryin' child
Set ten thousand supper tables
Now it's time to rest those hands a while
Those hands have done some prayin'
Worn just one wedding band
Now there ain't much time
And there ain't much strength
But there's a lot of love left in those hands
There's a lot of love left in those hands
