Katy brought my guitar back today
That's how she let me know it's all over
I remember all those nights
Sittin' in the fireplace light
How she loved to hear me play
Katy brought my guitar back today

Katy brought my guitar back today
I've seen it make her cry over and over
She told me when I wasn't there
She would wake up feeling scared
She'd hold it in her arms and be okay
Katy brought my guitar back today

We had our stormy times like anybody else
More than once I broke her heart
When I couldn't tell her I was sorry by myself
I could tell her with that old guitar
But I'm afraid this time things have gone too farKaty brought my guitar back today
I guess that means this time it's really over
As I sit and play it now
The songs all seem so sad somehow
I wish she'd just thrown that thing away
Katy brought my guitar back today

I remember all those nights
Sittin' in the fireplace light
How she used to love to hear me play
Katy brought my guitar back today
