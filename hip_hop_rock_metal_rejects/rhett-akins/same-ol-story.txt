Byron Hill/Rhett AkinsTrack 9 - Time 2:44
You let him by with another line again
And oh each time he swears this hurtin' you
Is comin' to an end
But Lord knows
He'll never close the book on doin' you wrong
'Cause every time you think it's over
It don't take him very long

Before he writes another page
To the same ol' story
No it don't ever change
And you'll always be sorry
If you don't put it on the shelf
And start livin' for yourself
'Cause all he's givin' you
Is the same ol' storyWell any fool can tell just where it's gonna end
And he'll keep adding more and more
To the pain he's put you in
Can't you see
This ain't the fairy tale you built your love upon
'Cause front to back, cover to cover
He's just leading your heart on
As he...

Writes another page
To the same ol' story
No it don't ever change
And you'll always be sorry
If you don't put it on the shelf
And start livin' for yourself
'Cause all he's givin' you
Is the same ol' story
Oh the same ol' same ol' story
