He never had given much thought to dancing
But she gave a lot of thought to being asked
Well he'd never been good at coming right on out and asking
And she'd never been given the chance
But something moved him 'cross that old gym floor
When fear was holding fast
And to his suprise the words came at last

And she said yes 
To his half-hearted request
And they held on for dear life
'Til the last song played
They won't let go
It's beyond their control
They lit a flame with the match God had made
When she said yes

From that night on the fire was burning
And they sure did shine in it's light
And he knew as long as this old world kept turning
He wanted her by his side
So with a ring and a nervous smile
And some lines that he rehearsed
He said the sweetest words that she'd ever heard

And she said yes 
To his whole hearted request
And they held on for dear life
'Til the last stars fade
They won't let go 
It's beyond their control
They lit a flame with the match God had made
When she said yes

They lit a flame with the match God had made 
When she said yes
