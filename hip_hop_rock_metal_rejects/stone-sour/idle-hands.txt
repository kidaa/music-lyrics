Idle Hands

Stuck to the dog, pissin' out both ends 
I got a hundred lethal weapons that I call my friends 
Ain't a person on Earth who could take my life 
I wish they would so a man could get some sleep at night
But my design is a mixture of descent and decay
I see a monster in the mirror fucking everyday
Can a man ever wash his hands of blood?
Perpetual deja vu, isn't that enough? 
Peel back the layers and see what I've become 
Satisfied? Now I feel nothing 
Stay away - I swear it wasn't me! 

See if you can relish if you close both eyes 
Every time I make an issue of it, someone dies 
Carried out like a hit man, set in stone 
Don't know why I even bother to be left alone
In my opinion, it's a self-serving fucked-up phase
Got a picture in my wallet that I keep, in case I 
Gotta go, gotta split, gotta make it to a higher level than this 
But I could be wrong, what I say is wrong, what I really want to say is

Peel back the layers and see what I've become 
Satisfied? Now I feel nothing 
Stay away - I swear it wasn't me! 

Run------ it doesn't matter, 
I need all the miracles that I can gather 
Run------ I can't pretend 
I put myself in idle hands again

Here's how it ends, just a bit too soon 
River deep in all the shit I let myself get into 
Doesn't anybody like it here? 
Blank looks, television drama and no fear 
Let another person fuck with your mind 
I bet you become the person who will fuck in time 
Man I just stopped caring, the music is blaring 
I feel you glaring, WHY WON'T YOU STOP STARING? 

Peel back the layers and see what I've become 
Satisfied? Now I feel nothing 
Stay away - I swear it wasn't me! 

Run------ it doesn't matter 
I need all the miracles that I can gather 
Run------ I can't pretend 
I put myself in idle hands again

GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!!
