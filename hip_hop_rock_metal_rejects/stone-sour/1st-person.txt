Why - is everything so grey - is everything so strange
Is everything so thrown together by mistake?
Why - is everything contrite- is everything a plight
Is everything so insincere and out of sight?

WHY - DOES EVERYTHING SEEM WRONG
DOES EVERYTHING LOOK DEAWN
DOES EVERYTHING SEEM BLASTED LIKE IT DOESN'Y BELONG?

I wanna make it a way - I wanna make it a waste
I wanna make it a gross misadventure
I WANNA MAKE YOU ALL!
I WANNA MAKE YOU ALL!
I WANNA MAKE YOU... lie to me... lie to me...

When - did everything go bad - did everything fall flat
Did everything decay and lose itself so fast?
When - did everything succumb - did everything go numb
Did everything lobotomize what it's become?

WHEN - DOES EVERYTHING COME BACK
DOES EVERYTHING RELAPSE
DOES EVERYTHING SAVE FACE AND FIND ITSELF AT LAST?

I wanna show you the way - I wanna show you the waste
I wanna show you the worst misadventure
I WANNA SHOW YOU ALL!
I WANNA SHOW YOU ALL!
I WANNA SHOOW YOU HOW TO... die for me... die for me...

I wanna give it a way - i wanna give it the waste
I wanna give it the worst misadventure
I WANNA GIVE IT ALL!
I'M GANNA GIVE IT ALL!
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP!
Lie to me... die for me...

Now - everything's a lie - everything's your lie
Everything's a face inside another lie
Now - everything's a side - everything's one side
Everything depends on just which side you're on...
