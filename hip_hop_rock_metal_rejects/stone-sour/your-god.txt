Reveal to me this ugly thing
I must've meddled by your head
It's getting out of hand again
Nobody sees it, but I can

You thought of everything, I bet
But did you think that I might die?
I haven't really smiled, and I don't know how long you know
Something's going to give again, somethings going to give again

I try to fight, but did you listen?
Even though you're gone, I'm never finished
I can never be your God
And I don't even think I want the job, anymore.

Say something, anything to me.
I did believe, but I have doubts
So many reasons to hold on
Conflicting interest is not it

I guess I'm better off in the end
Coz you were always there to blame
I havent' felt so bad, and I don't know how long you know
I can't get away again, I can't get away again..

I try to fight, but did you listen?
Even though you're gone, I'm never finished
I can never be your God
And I don't even think I want the job, anymore. [x2]

What am I supposed to now?
How am I supposed to live now?

All I ever did was try, but the story ends
So I guess I'ma have to die

Where am I supposed to go now?

Go ahead, and go away [x4]
Go away.

What am I supposed to now?
How am I supposed to live now?

All I ever did was try, but the story ends
So I guess I'ma have to die

What am I supposed to now?
How am I supposed to live now?

What am I supposed to Now?
How am I supposed to live Now?

How am I supposed to live?
