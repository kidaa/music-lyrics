Can you take away every single day? 
That we have given to another false prophet 
Can you give us all a reason not to fall? 
Before you take away another broken promise 

Show your pretty face 
Hide the bitter taste 
You're still the rapist of an entire nation 
You wanna be the man you gotta be a man 
But you were nothing but a sad insinuation 
Oooooh 
How can we ever live this down? 
Oooooh 
How can we ever live this down? 

Keep your fingers crossed 
The truth is at a lost 
Big decision for an ordinary coward 
The only problem is your fucking rhetoric 
We're more in danger then before you took power 

Now it's just a game 
God you'll never change 
You'd sell us out if you could only find a buyer 
You don't give a shit 
As long as idiots 
Are in your corner you could set us all on fire 
Oooooh 
How can we ever live this down? 
Oooooh 
How can we ever live this down? 

You never wanted to be 
They only wanted a parody 
You want the world to be free 
But what the hell is free about it?! 

Now we reached the end 
Just get it over with 
But this is building to an adament conclusion 
Come what ever may 
There's gonna be a day 
When we have figured out a possible solution 

Every thing you've done 
Is killing everyone 
A little smile on a homicidal bastard 
You wanna be a man 
You gotta have a plan 
Another failure is a guarenteed disaster 
Oooooh 
How can we ever live this down? 
Oooooh 
How can we ever live this down? 

You never wanted to be 
They only wanted a parody 
You want the world to be free 
She only wanted the world 
You never wanted me 
They only wanted a parody 
You want the world to be free 
But what the fuck is free about it?! 
What the fuck is free about it?! 
What the fuck is free about it?!
