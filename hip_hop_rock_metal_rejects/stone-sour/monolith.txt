Monolith

Is this wrong of me? I've come so far, so fast
I'm in the dark about a lot of things
Seems so real - TO ME!
I'VE CONSECRATED!
I WISH THAT I COULD HATE IT
I SAW MY BLOODY HANDS COME CLEAN BEFORE MY EYES!
And I hear my wants and needs again, can you help me?
And I hear a different kind again, someone stop me
And I feel the strain inside my mind, am I crazy?
And I need to shed my skin, reveal this monolith within

Visions plague my dreams - oh God, what beast did this?
I couldn't have oh Jesus, I just don't know
What's inside - OF ME?
I'VE DESECRATED!
MY GOD, I LOVE TO HATE IT!
MY HANDS ARE BLOODY AGAIN, THERE'S NO REASON WHY!

And I hear my wants and needs again, can you help me?
And I hear a different kind again, someone stop me
And I feel the strain inside my mind, am I crazy?
And I need to shed my skin, reveal this monolith within

Solo: Josh

And I hear my wants and needs again, can you help me?
And I hear a different kind again, can you stop me
And I feel the strain inside my mind, am I crazy?
And I need to shed my skin, reveal this monolith within

WITHIN!
