HEAR ME!!
Remember all the times you bent our truth and crossed our lines?
All things considered, it was just our normal way of life
But somewhere in the middle, we got caught and dragged away
So my tribunal brings us here so I can fall today

All - you want is soulless
All - you got to break us
All - I have to do is
Stop - your fucking nonsense

I CAN'T BETRAY!
I CAN'T BETRAY - MYSELF!

I stand before you as a victim, as the system rots
I couldn't focus, so I staggered when I heard the shots
There are no labels and no rehabilitation here
You are surrounded by the very fucking thoughts you fear

All - you want is soulless
All - you got to break us
HEAR ME!!!

All - I have to do is
Stop - your fucking nonsense

I CAN'T BETRAY!
I CAN'T BETRAY - MYSELF!

I watch the hope I had disintegrate before my eyes
I take a minute and reflect on all your fucking lies
Behind the door, you have two choices, but you don't get to choose
You can survive or you can die - either way you lose

All - you want is soulless
All - you got to break us
All - I have to do is

Stop - your fucking nonsense

I CAN'T BETRAY!
I CAN'T BETRAY - MYSELF!
