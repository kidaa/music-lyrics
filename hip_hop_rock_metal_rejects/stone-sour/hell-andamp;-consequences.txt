I'm not a victim,
till I let you take me down.
Im not a target at the sites of your mercy,
I never asked for anything,
Im not asking now.
I will not be afraid,
I will not be afraid.

Ive done this on my own
and I don't care what you do to me,
I woulnt hand over what is mine
Ive done this for too long,
to let you take it away from me,
its to late to stop me
cause I refuse to die.

I havent weakened just because ive shown my self
ive taken everything, except everything that's forgranted
I'll leave hypocrisy for everybody else
I will not be afraid
I will not be afraid,

Ive done this on my own
and I don't care what you do to me,
I woulnt hand over what is mine
Ive done this for too long,
to let you take it away from me,
its to late to stop me
cause I refuse to die.

I'm not a problem
untill you make one out of spite
Ill give you hell and consequences for trying,
don't want an enemy,
DON'T FUCK WITH MY LIFE

I will not be afraid,
I will not be afraid,

Ive done this on my own
and I don't care what you do to me,
I woulnt hand over what is mine
Ive done this for too long,
to let you take it away from me,
its to late to stop me
cause I refuse to die.

Ive done this on my own
and I don't care what you do to me,
I woulnt hand over ,
I woulnt hand over what is mine
Ive done this for too long,
to let you take it away from me,
its to late to stop me
cause I refuse
I refuse... to die.
I refuse to die!
