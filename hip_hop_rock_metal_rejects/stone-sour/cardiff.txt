This fluid feels like pain
This stoic mood is all in vain
I reach into the dark
I tear the sun and me apart
How many years ago
How many deaths I can't let go
My flesh is temporary, my God extraordinary

You.. can't.. kill.. MY... MIND
A man delivered can never make his way in darkness I know tonight will end but I won't give this life
Away again

Sifting through the seen debris
Oh my father call to me
This smoke is in my blood
This home is just no good
Save me from my bitterness
Give me up I did my best
Chalk this system full of shit
Lock this fucker lost in it

You.. can't.. kill.. MY MIND
A man delivered can never make his way in darkness I know tonight will end but I won't give this life
Away I won't give this life away

A man surrendered can never find his own forgiveness I know my life will end but I won't give tonight
Away.. I won't give tonight away!

Oh yeahh!
