This one came from looking 
This one opened twice 
These two seem as smooth as silk, flush againt my eyes 
This one needed stiches and 
This one came from rings 
This one isn't even there, but I feel it more because you don't care 

Yeah, Cut right into me 
Yeah, Cause I am Made Of Scars 
Yes I am made of scars 

This one had it comming 
This one found a vein 
This one was an accident, but never gave me pain 
This one was my fathers and 
This one you can't see 
This one had me scared to death,
But I guess I should be glad I'm not dead!! 

Yeah, Cut right into me 
Yeah, I am made of scars 
Yes, I am made of scars 

God, Don't you believe it 

And I will find a way 
Everything you are I will betray 
Oooh, I swear that I will find a way 
Everything you are's inside me 

This one was the first one 
This one had a vice 
This one here I like to rub on dark and stormy nights 
This one was the last one, 
I don't remember how 
But I remember blood and rain 
AND I NEVER SAW IT COMING AGAIN 

Yeah, Cut right into me 
Yeah, Cause I am made of scars 
Yes, I am made of scars 

That's what I'm made of!!!
