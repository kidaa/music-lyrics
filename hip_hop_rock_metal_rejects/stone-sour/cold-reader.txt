I can only hurt your case
It's written on your face
You always come to me
I won't be used, but
I - can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up the door, oh

NO! I WON'T! I CAN'T! NOT ANYMORE!
ONE MORE TIME AND I THINK I'LL FUCKING DIE!
WHY? DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES?

Stay Away from who I am
Cuz I know what you are
I can't believe you're here
Then again, you know that

I - can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul, oh

NO! I WON'T! I CAN'T! NOT ANYMORE!
ONE MORE TIME AND I THINK I'LL FUCKING DIE!
WHY? DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES?

Stop I know your goddamn game
It's always been the same
The story hasn't changed
Neither will you, but

I - can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul

NO! I WON'T! I CAN'T! NOT ANYMORE!
ONE MORE TIME AND I THINK I'LL FUCKING DIE!
WHY? DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES?
