I am walking through your streets
I am looking in your windows
I am elemental now
You'll never even know I'm there

I am watching over you
I am living in the shadows
I am just a word to you, but I am very real and cold
Cold to all of this
Cold to how you feel
Cold to all your loose reason

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be...

Yeah

I am all there is to know
I am all that you've forgotten
I am enigmatic now
You never even knew my name
I am dressed in tragedy
I am by design immortal
I am just the last one left but I am always here and old

Old and very strong
Old as all you feel
Old as all the world around you

Yeah

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be...Reborn
This is the start of something
