Inhale

Come one and all and see the broken man, talking to himself
He sits and waits for something better, he'll never find it here
The people touch his hair and pinch his cheek; he can't even feel it
There it goes again, he's listening to someone
He hears the bitter laughter
And all he wants to know is

Why------ does any of it matter? I can't take it anymore
You've gotta try------ the inhale that makes the exhale so much better 

He wipes his hands on anything in reach, he never feels clean 
He shakes at night because his nerve is gone, every muscle hurts 
Come one and all and see what happenedthat broken man is me 

There it goes again, I can hear it louder
It doesn't feel good anymore
All I want to know is

Why------ does any of it matter? I can't take it anymore
You've gotta try------ the inhale that makes the exhale so much better

NOW I KNOW I DISAPPEAR!
I CAN'T FIND MY WAY FROM OUT OF HERE!
EVERYTHING IS FADING ON ME!
SOMEONE TELL ME someone tell me
Someone - tell me 

Why------ does any of it matter? I can't take it anymore
You've gotta try------ the inhale that makes the exhale so much better 

WHY?! YOU'VE GOTTA TRY!!
