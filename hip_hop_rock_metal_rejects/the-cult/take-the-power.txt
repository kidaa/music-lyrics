You love it, you need it
You taste it and you'd breathe it
You want it, you feel it
You gotta recieve it

You hate it, can't leave it
You shoot it, you cheat it
Reject it, respect it
Don't try to decieve it

Take the power, we're all free, yeah
Take the power, you gotta let it bleed, yeah
C'mon, take the power, you gotta just beleive, yeah
Take the power, it's all in me, it's all in me

You love it, you need it
You taste it and you breathe it
You want it, you feel it
You've got to recieve it

You hate it, can't leave it
You shoot it, you can't cheat it
Reject it, respect it
Don't try to decieve it

Take the power, we're all free
Take the power, you gotta let it bleed
C'mon, take the power, gotta just beleive

Kiss the heart that hides this face, it never fades
Take a little leap of faith
Kiss the heart that hides this face, it never fades
