I float through day and nite life most of the time
Till I hung up my blues on a nail on your wall
It rained flowers when the music began
Love all around when the music is loud
Every day Nirvana
Always this way
I wish every day was like nirvana
Always this way
I'm not looking for girls or cheap thrills and pills
Always this way
I wish every day was like nirvana
Always this way every day
Like the sun Nirvana
Always this way
