Drag me back
Drag me back
Through the revolution without solution
As the wall gets taller
As you get smaller
As we get smaller
The fear is getting taller
The big neon glitter pushes into you
Sex from the hip at the crack of a whip
The wall gets taller
While you get smaller
Push against the big neon glitter
Pushes into you
