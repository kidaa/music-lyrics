If that's the way that it is, ooh
If
If that's the way that it is

If we put our hearts together
And overcome our hesitation
Maybe we could join our love as one
And storm the gates of heaven, yeah

If the winds of change
Would blow in the favour of man
Resolve our situation
Undo the work of idle temptation

Oh yeah
well, the test of time, the test of time
Oh yeah
You know, freedom will fly, yeah

If
If that's the way that it is
We gotta fight to live
If
If that's the way that it is, yeah
We gotta fight to live, yeah

If the tribes of Eden
Could find some common ground
Share in life and wisdom
And free our minds from prison, baby
If there came a prophet
Will he show us to the promised land?
Gotta start talkin'
Gotta start talkin'
Talkin', yeah

Whoa yeah-yeahOh, the test of time
Oh, freedom will fly

Runnin' out of time, yeah
Coming like a holy war

Gotta struggle now
