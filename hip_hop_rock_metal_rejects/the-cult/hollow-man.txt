It's so nice to get away for a day
I see a hollow man gun in hand it points my way
He follows me everywhere and everyday
I got to get away
I won't miss him if he goes away and stays away
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man hollow man hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man hollow man hollow man
