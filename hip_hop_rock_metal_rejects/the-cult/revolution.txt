Swirling pictures of never ending dreams
I can't see what these images mean
Locked inside can't set the rainbow free
Like perishing flowers they sag and twist and die
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
Joy or sorrow what does revolution mean
To save today is like wishing in the wind
All my beautiful friends have all gone away
Like the waves they flow and ebb and die
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
