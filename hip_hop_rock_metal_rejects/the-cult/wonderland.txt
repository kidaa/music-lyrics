Divine intervention in this decaying world
While a hip young dude stood passionately
Succumbing to the he-dog sound
Of the mystifying beat combo that
Breaks down your door
Gonna take you high now, take you real high

Kickin' down the devil's door
Cheap thrills baby, I need some more
City on fire becoming me
Let's hurry lover and fly together
Majestic high and soaring now
Babylon bares her breast again
Time's like quicksand
Soon again, I'm standing naked in

Wonderland
I feel mistreated, yeah, ow
Wonderland
I feel defeated but not for long

Oh, tear the petals from this sweet narcissus
Crumbles gently in the palm of my hand
What once was inviting is dull and blinding
Once magnificent has slipped away
Serpent in my belly stomach crawlin' now
Wipe the sweat from my furrowed brow
Time's like quicksand
Soon again, I'm standing naked inWonderland
I feel mistreated, yeah
Wonderland
I feel defeated, yeah, but not for long
Wonderland
Bound and branded, yeah, on my back
Wonderland
Tired and cheated, yeah-yeah
Ooh yeah

Divine intervention in this decaying world
While the hip young dude stood passionately
Succumbing to the he-dog sound
You know the sound that breaks down your doors?
Are listening to me, now?
The sound of a mystifying beat combo
That's gonna take you higher, baby

Wonderland
Bound and branded, look out
Wonderland
Tired, tired and cheated, yeah

Earth's your mother...
Heed your brother...
