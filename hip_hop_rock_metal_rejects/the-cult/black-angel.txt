A fugitive has been away so long
A thousand years and now he thinks of home
The long men are waiting in the wings to put him in chains upon his return
Emptiness his bitterness is gone
Journey the road to the eternal reward
It's a long way to go
A black angel at your side
A long way to go that angel at your side
A long way to go the reaper at your side
A long way to go
A black angel at your side
The sirens call a sailor to die
Enchanted by the sound his desires have been found
In his mind his life is rushing by
All this while the storm it rages on
