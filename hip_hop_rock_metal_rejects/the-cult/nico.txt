Hey Nico, stay strong in this world
My girl, ignore their cold words
The song of your heart's so true
The sigh is a way for you
Hey Nico, stay strong in this world

I watched your spirit fly 
Across the velvet sky
The secrets that you hide

I'm lost inside your sweet kiss
Hey Nico, the life that you missed
Sometimes you're so strange to me
Alone as your heart that bleeds alone
Hey Nico, stay strong in this world, my girl

I watched your spirit fly
Across the velvet sky
The secrets that you hide
Yeah, the secret that you hide, that you hide

Then you fell
And then you fell
And then you fell
And then you fell straight to hellStraight to hell
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Striaght to hell

The silence of your wings
The beauty that it brings
A kiss before we die
One kiss before we fry

I watched your spirit fly
Across the velvet sky
The secrets that you hide
The secret that you hide
Whoa-whoa, yeah

I watched your spirit fly
Across the velvet sky
The secrets that you hide
A secret that you hide, that you hide

Yeah, yeah...
