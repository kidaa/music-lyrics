You are the sun, I am the flame
You are the blood, I am the same
We are the love that rises again
They are the snake that bites on your veins

We are not chained to the wheel

You are the tear, I have no fear
You are so strange, I feel the same
Sorcerous mind, we ride again

We are not chained to the wheel, to the wheel

It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
You got wings upon your back and you can fly

It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
'Cause you're up against the world and still you rise
And still you rise

You are alive and high in my dreams
You are the stars that mystify me
And you are the wolf that frightens the thief
And you are the voice that they disbelieve

We are not chained to the wheelAnd you are the spark that sets us all free

We are not chained to the wheel, to the wheel

It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
You got wings upon your back and you can fly

It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
'Cause you're up against the world and still you rise
And still you rise

Whoa, baby

It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
You got wings upon your back and you can fly

It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
'Cause you're up against the world and still you rise
And still you rise
Still you rise
Still you rise
