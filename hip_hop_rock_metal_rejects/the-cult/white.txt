Snow is crystal, the fire is cold
I sit back, watch the sun turn gold
In the morning, love is healing
Warms the frost deep in my bones
And then your mother said

White
It's shining
Shining bright

The hunter sits on a pure white stallion
A hawk in flight, the bow in his hand
A deer approaches at the end of the forest
The arrow flies, blood on the snow
Said brother, said

White
Yeah, white
Shining
Shining brightly
White

Blood on the snow
Said brother, say
White
Shining
Shining bright

Snow is crystal
Love is pure
I look out and see a hawk in flight
The forest awaits me, the keel awaits me
I reel back, watch the sun turn to gold

Earth in the mother
Said white
Sure crystal clear, yeah, virgin white
Wilderness, lost to us
Wilderness, we reach out
Wilderness, we must embrace you once more

Yeah...
White

Shining brightly
Snow is pure now

When the barbarians approach on the frontiers of a civilization, 
it is a sign of a crisis in that civilization.
When the barbarians come, not with weapons of war, but 
with songs and icons of peace. 
It is a sign of the crisis in one of a spiritual nature.
That a spiritual nature.
We have forgotten our spiritual nature.
Cause we are wrapped up in too much shit all day, all night.
