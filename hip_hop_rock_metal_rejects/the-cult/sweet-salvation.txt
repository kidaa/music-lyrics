Oh, ask the dust
No harm will come between us
Oh beautiful, radiant child
Eyes azure, vow to me
Your golden heart
Ooh, she moves in silence
Then whispers to me
Sets my soul harp on fire

Sweet salvation, baby
Melts my heart made of stone
Please guide me and carry me on
Sweet salvation is 
For this man made of stone
Please hold me and embrace my soul

Seduced by your glance
Overwhelmed and enchanted by you, baby
Well, when the loving is good
Do you feel strong now?
You know past lives, they don't matter anyhow
Oh, she moves in silence
Then she whispers to me
Sets my soul harp on fire

Sweet salvation, baby
Melts my heart made of stone
Please guide me and carry me on, yeah
Sweet salvation is 
For this man made of stone
Please hold me and embrace my soul
