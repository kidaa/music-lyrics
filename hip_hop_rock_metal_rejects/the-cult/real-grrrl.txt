Free baby
Free baby
Free baby

I shaved my head
Yeah, wiped the sheet clean
Hangman has packed up 
I continue to dream

My words are broken
It's not easy to chew
So much unknown 
So much is knowing, too

Lost 
I'm lost in your shadow
Lost, oh yeah-yeah 
I'm lost in your shadow

I explode in your belly
My skull in your hands
You drive me like honey 
Across sour taste glands
Free baby
Free again baby
Yeah, semen is pure
It's divine on your vine

Lost 
I'm lost in your shadow
And I'm lost, yeah
I'm lost in your shadow

Yeah real girl, you cut through my blues
Yeah real girl, well you're golden to your shoes
You're really, really, really, really, really, really, real, yeah
Yeah real girl
Oh, femme fatal with fur

Na-na-na-na-na...

Let's flow together
Let's come together
Let's swim together
Hypnotize each other

Yeah real girl, you cut through my blues
Real girl, well you're golden to your shoes
Real girl, yeah 
Femme fatal with fur

I explode in your belly 
My skull in your hands
Drive me like sugar 
Across sour taste glands

I shaved my head 
Yeah, wiped the sheet clean
Hangman is packed up 
I continued every day

Lost, oh yeah-yeah 
Lost in your shadow
Lost, oh yeah-yeah
I'm lost in your shadow

I'm lost in your shadow
Lost
Lost 
Lost
I'm lost in your shadow

I am lost
I am lost
I am lost
