I was standing on the mountain, back against the world
Left it all behind me, how my life had turned
Seen so much destruction, the fear upon your skin
Don't let it turn against you, drive you down again

Caught up in the moment, accelerated dream
Possessed by a notion of how my life should be

All you true believers
You gotta move on, gotta move on, gotta move on
All you true believers
You gotta move on with your life, yeah

Pick up your pretty head, girl, stop crying to yourself
Run into the wild places far from here
We are darker angels, black lighting in our heads
We are far beyond the moment, too far to care

Standing on the mountain, our backs against the world
When we leave it all behind us, how our lives have turned, whoa-oh

All you true believers
You gotta move on, gotta move on, gotta move on, yeah, c'mon now
All you true believers
You gotta move on with your life, whoa-oh

I believe that it shines...

I was standing on the mountain, my back's against the world
Left it all behind me, and how my life had turned
I seen so much destruction, the fear upon your skin
Don't let it turn against you and drive you down again

All you true believers
You gotta move on, gotta move on, gotta move on, whoa, yeah
All you true believers
You gotta move on with your lives, whoa-whoa

I got a mortal skin
Got a mortal life
Wanna be immortalized
Living in forever skies
I wanna live forever, yeah

I got a mortal skin
Got a mortal life
Wanna be immortalized
Living in forever skies
I wanna live forever

Got a mortal life
Got a mortal skin
Wanna be immortalized
