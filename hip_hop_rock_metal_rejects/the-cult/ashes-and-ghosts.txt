Ashes and ghosts are all around me, yeah on
On the night of the assassins, they came, and I was ready

Do you beleive? 
Oh, yeah
Do you beleive?

I look around the world and see
The winged waifs powdered on petal dust
I can't believe the sorcerer's dream has come
And never chosen one of us

All around, the atoms raging
I can see your magic's failing
I do believe they're gonna get you
I do believe, can't cast a spell on me

Ashes and ghosts are all around me
I don't believe in what you're saying, no, no, no, no
Ashes and ghosts, they fill my heart
Can't cast a spell on me

Ashes and ghosts are all around me
You broke the truth and now you're fading
Ashes and ghosts, they fill my heart
You're a fake, yeah, you're a fraud

The assassin's hand has planned 
To pull the wings off every one of us, yeah
Cracked fairy head's are spinning down
The blood shot eyes, nostrils flared at us

All around, the atoms raging
I can see your magic's failing
I do believe they're gonna get you
I do believe, can't cast a spell on me

Ashes and ghosts are all around me
I don't believe in what you're saying, no, no, no, no
Ashes and ghosts, they fill my heart
Can't cast a spell on me

Ashes and ghosts are all around me
You broke the truth and now you're fading
Ashes and ghosts, they fill my heart
You're a dog, you're a fake, you're a fraud

Can't cast a spell on me

Ashes and ghosts are all around me
I don't believe in what you're saying, whoa, oh-oh
Ashes and ghosts, they fill my heart
Can't cast a spell on me

Ashes and ghosts are all around me
You broke the truth and now you're fading
Ashes and ghosts, they fill my heart
You're fading, yeah, you're fading, fading

Don't believe in what you're saying
Can't cast a spell on me, oh-whoa, no, no, no, no
You broke the truth and now you're fading
Yeah, you're fading, yeah, you're fading, yeah, you're fading
