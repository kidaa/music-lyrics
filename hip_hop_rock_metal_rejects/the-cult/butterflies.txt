The wild wide eye with her painted wing 
She crushed the gray boy 
Don't you know my selfishness was my suicide 
Her painted wing became my suicide, suicide

The whole world did not start to cry 
They just got inside me 
And now they walk behind me 
They walk behind me
They walk behind me
Oh lord
Like little dogs 
Like stony dogs, you know 
Stony dogs
Stony dogsThey walk behind me, oh lord
They walk
Behind me
Behind me, oh lord
