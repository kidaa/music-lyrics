Hail the guitar, all tuned down
In a power circle, obey the crowd
All ride a wave, crash right in
Lovers and fighters, adrenaline

The singer spits, our hearts all rise
Energy is visible, we all crush tight
All washed away, tsunami wave
Fragile human, all the same

And now, I face the sound 
When all around is burning
I'm like Hermes, drifting down

I am the saint, your path into the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint, the path into the light

Caught in a trap, the systems are down
Communication's broken, I feel underground
Weight of the storm, in sound, we all drown
You'll never understand what drives us all onAnd now, I face the sound
And all around is burning
I'm like Hermes, drifting down, down, down, down

I am the saint, your path, the way, the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint, your path, the way, the light

I am the saint, your path into the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint, your path, the way, the light

I am the saint...
