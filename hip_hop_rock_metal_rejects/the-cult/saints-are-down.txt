I'm so blind, I cannot see
You're so warm to me
I'm not there and you are here
Please take me

Yeah, the saints are down
Oh, the saints are down
The saints are down
The saints are down

Life's so long, or short should I say?
I am here to get it on with you today
Girl, you should know that I love you more than I can say
Sometimes I fear all those things that come down on us anyway

But I gotta tell ya that my
My saints are down 
That my saints are down
Let me tell you why
Saints are down 
The saints are down 

Hey, pretty good, what do you got to say?
Whose fucking life is it anyway?
Don't you know anything about anybody else?
You're so wrapped up in your tiny self

Oh, let me tell ya
Saints are down, yes they are
Your saints are down
Your saints are down
The saints are down

They're down 
And they're not coming round
Yeah, they're not easily found
Buried
And they're buried in the ground
Yeah, they're buried upside down

Saints are down
Saints are down
Saints are down
Saints are down
Saints are down

The saints are down
Yes they are
Yes they are, well
You'll never see them again, no

Your saints are down...
