You're a righteous child, got a tear tattooed on your face
Yeah, sometimes you drink too much, well hey, that's ok
Don't you know the truth is killing you?
Ain't it strange all the things in your life
Hey, that you're going through?

Some of my friends, they died real young
Oh, yes they did...
They never got to fly to the heart of the sun, no they didn't
There's one thing in my life that I love
Naturally high
Naturally high
Naturally high
In the kingdom of your love

A little bit of grease on my halo
Like some holy dharma bum, hey
I'm drunk on, I'm drunk on truth, and truth, and truth
This time it's not for fun, it's for real

Some of my friends, they died real young
Yes they did...
They never got to fly as high as the sun 
No they didn't...
There's one thing in my life that I love
Naturally high
Naturally high
Naturally high
In the kingdom of your love
