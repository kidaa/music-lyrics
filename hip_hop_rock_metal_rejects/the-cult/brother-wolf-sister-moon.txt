Embrace the wind with both arms
Stop the clouds dead in sky
Hang your head no more
And beg no more
Brother Wolf and Sister Moon
Your Time has come
Brother Wolf and Sister Moon
Your time has come and the wind will blow my fears away
And dry my tears away
And the wind will will blow my fears away
And dry my tears away
