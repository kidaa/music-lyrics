Cultivate a war breed
Get the head your soul needs
Crystallize at light speed
Dis the lies that they feed

Get the head your soul needs
Crystallize at light speed
Dis the lies that they feed, that they feed

We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control

War, a state of mind
War, our hearts are blind
War, is nature dead?
War, war

Holy war, tears of man 
Drop your front, baby, obey the command
Holy war, tears of man 
Drop your front, baby, obey my command

Split the lip that dope feeds
Exterminate the bad seed
Tread the path that monks breathe
Ride the horse that runs free, that runs free

We're burning out of control

War, our hearts are blind
War, is nature dead?
War, war

Holy war, tears of man 
Drop your front, baby, obey the command

Drop your front, baby, obey my command

Lies, drugs, hate, guns, God, fear, flies, sex
