Shaking your fist, yeah
Do you feel like a man?
Got a rock in your pocket
Got the girl by the hand

Flick the bird to the world, yeah
'Cause the world is your plan
Don't stand still for no one
Don't take it, take it, take it

All my life, I never learned
My bridge is raised, yay-yay, my bridges burn
And all my dreams seem faded away, yeah
My bridge is raised, yay-yay, my bridges burn

Hang your head 'till tomorrow
Look to the stars for your muse
Yeah, the world's better mellow
Yeah, you're judged by your shoes

Yeah, your mouth is so dirty
Since you were a kid
Rise up like a flame
Don't take it, take it, take it, take itAll my life, I never learned
My bridge is raised, yay-yay, my bridges burn
And all my dreams seem faded away, yeah
My bridge is raised, yay, well, my bridges burn

Don't be a zero, be a hero
A sex pistol, guitar hero
Don't be a zero, you gotta be a hero
A sex pistol, guitar hero

All my life, I never learned
My bridge is raised, my bridges burn
And all my dreams seem faded away, yeah
My bridge is raised, well, my bridges burn, yeah

Be a hero, oh
A sex pistol, oh
An alert atomic bomb, yeah
