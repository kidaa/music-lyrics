Go west young man 
And break bread in the new lands 
And my life is over 
While your's just beginning 

Go west young man 
And break bread in the new lands

Are your dreams in the new lands?

While your's just beginning

Go west young man
And spread your wings in the new, new, new, new, new lands 
And my life is over while your's just beginning
Say hey

We can offer you everything...

Go west young man 
And break those heads in the new lands 
And my life is over 
While your's just beginning

Say hey
We can offer you everything...
