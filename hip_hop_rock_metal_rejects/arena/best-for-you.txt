I love you too much baby
To stand in yor way
You know I'm not afraid
To hear what you have to say
I know it maybe time for you to leave
But you always got a friend in me

Cause I only want the best for you
My darling, the best for you

My baby, the best for you

So many nights, baby
I've spent in your arms
How could I ever change
This feeling inside my heart
I hope you'll find happiness with me
But even if it's not too big

I only want the best for you
My darling, the best for you
I only want the best for you
My baby, the best for you

If there's anything that I can do
Please tell me
Cause I only want the best for
Only want the best for you

Oh baby we've got time

Only want the best for you
