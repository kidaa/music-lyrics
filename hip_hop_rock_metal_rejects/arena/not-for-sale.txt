Here we are
Face to face
Who would have ever believed we could 
End up in this place
You and I 
We've come so far
And darlin' though
You're amazed
That I keep on loving you more everyday
But there's something I want you to know
Even if all my dreams should come true
Even if I should fail
I made you a promise
So don't you worry
This soul is not for sale
Not for sale
You're the one
When it rains
Who I can run to for cover
And comfort from my pain
And bloom like a rose in your sun
And we hold on
To what is real
Not willing to sacrifice this love that we feel
Cause we know where our joy comes from 
Even if all my dreams should come true
Even if I should fail
I've made you a promise
So don't you worry
This soul is not for sale
Even if all my dreams should come true
Even if I should fail
I've made you a promise
So don't you worry
This soul is not for sale
This soul is not for sale
Not for sale
Baby it's not for sale
