It took me twenty years to stand up straight and tall
It took me all of twenty seconds for everything to fall
I don't worry about my pride anymore
'Cause pride is something, I just can't afford 

I'd go beggin' in the rain
If I could spare you any pain
When it comes to you, I have no shame
No shame, no shame 

There's no life by your side, I wouldn't live
There's no sin you could commit that I would not forgive
I don't try to understand anymore
'Cause I just know my world, begins at your door 

If I could keep you from the cold
If I could make your tears my own
I'd do anything, I have no shame 

No shame - for the first time in my life
No shame - to get it right for you I wouldn't think twice
No shame - nothin' I won't sacrifice
There's nothing I won't do baby
To get you through the night 

Fallin', fallin'
I'll be there to reach you baby
To catch you when you're cryin'
I'll be callin', I'll be callin'
With a love for you that no name
I have no shame 

I'd go beggin' in the rain
If I could spare you any pain
When it comes to you, I have no shame 

No shame - for the first time in my life
No shame - to get it right for you I wouldn't think twice
No shame - nothin' I won't sacrifice
There's nothing I won't do baby
To get you through the night
