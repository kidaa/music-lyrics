Woo woo, woo woo woo 
Woo woo, close to my heart 

No secrets between us 
It's time for us to both come clean 
Let the water wash away illusion 
From now on I need more than a dream 

I demand attention from the one I love 
You'll get my affection when you give enough 
So tell the truth from the very start 
Then I'll keep our secrets 
Close to my heart 

Woo woo, woo woo woo 
Woo woo, close to my heart 
Woo woo, woo woo baby 
Tell the truth from the very start 

Red roses cool champagne 
You know it really doesn't matter to me 
There is only one door through my soul 
Be good and I'll give you the key 

I demand attention from the one I love 
You'll get my affection when you five enough 
So tell the truth from the very start 
Then I'll keep our secrets 
Close to my heart 

Woo woo, woo woo woo 
Woo woo, close to my heart 
Woo woo, woo woo baby 
Tell the truth from the very start 

Woo woo, woo woo woo 
Woo woo, close to my heart 
Woo woo, woo woo baby 
Tell the truth from the very start 

I demand attention from the one I love 
You'll get my affection when you five enough 
So tell the truth from the very start 
Then I'll keep our secrets 
Close to my heart 

Woo woo, woo woo woo 
Woo woo, close to my heart 
Woo woo, woo woo baby 
Tell the truth from the very start
