If I was the sun
I would shine my light
To light your world
If I was the rain
I would wash your tears away
I keep your world right
Be your light in the night
If I was the sky
I would rain down love into your life

If I was a river
You would be my ocean
Every stream would lead me to your arms
And if
If I was a river
I'll flow to you forever
Love would run forever in this heart of mine
If I, if I
If I was a river   

If I was the wind
I would carry you
Above the clouds
And if I was the earth
I would be your solid ground
If I could I'll be
All you ever would need
I would be your world
You're the only world there is for me   

If I was a river
You would be my ocean
Every stream would lead me to your arms
And if
If I was a river
I'll flow to you forever
Love would run forever in this heart of mine
If I, if I
If I was a river   

I'll run into your arms
Into your arms
Oh yeah
I'll run to you baby
Oh yeah 

If I was a river
You would be my ocean
Every stream would lead me to your arms
And if
If I was a river
I'll flow to you forever
Love would run forever in this heart of mine
If I, if I
If I was a river
