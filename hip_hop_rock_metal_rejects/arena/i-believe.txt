I believe when I fall in love 
With you it will be forever 

Shattered dreams, worthless years 
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell 
Life began, then was done 
Now I stare into a cold and empty well 
The many sounds that meet our ears 
The sights our eyes behold 
Will open up our merging hearts 
And feed our empty souls 

I believe when I fall in love 
With you it will be forever 
I believe when I fall in love 
This time it will be forever 

Without despair we will share 
And the joys of caring will not be replaced 
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm 
They won't be hard to find 
And the words of love I speak to you 
Will echo in your mind 

I believe when I fall in love 
With you it will be forever 
I believe when I fall in love 
This time it will be forever 

I believe when I fall in love 
With you it will be forever 
I believe when I fall in love 
This time it will be forever 
[Repeat to fade]
