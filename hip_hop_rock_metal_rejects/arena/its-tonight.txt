You're like a shooting star 
Sparks are flying everywhere 
No matter where you are 
They're gonna follow you right there You're gonna find it 

Now come into my ray of light 
It's a slice of heaven called sheer delight 
You can't escape the light of day 
Anything you wanna do to satisfy 
It's alright 
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow's out of sight 
It's tonight 

Come on get on your feet 
And let the music take you there 
Change your reality 
And feel the fire if you dare you're gonna find it 

Come into my ray of light 
It's a slice of heaven called sheer delight 
And if you can't escape the light of day baby wait 
Anything you want to do to satisfy 
It's alright 
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow's out of sight 
It's tonight 

Leave the entire world in tatters 
Here and now is all that matters 
Alice and all her mad mad hatters 
Had it right it's tonight 

Go into imagination 
Feel the silence and sensation 
Your life is your own creation 
Make it right 

Your like a shooting star ... 
No matter where you are ... 

Anything you want to do to satisfy 
It's alright 
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow's out of sight 
It's tonight 
Anything you want to do to satisfy 
It's alright 
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow's out of sight 
It's tonight 

Go into imagination it's tonight 
Feel the silence and sensation 
Your life is your own creation it's tonight 
Make it right 

Leave the entire world in tatters it's tonight 
Here and now is all that matters 
Alice and all her mad mad hatters 
Had it right it's tonight
