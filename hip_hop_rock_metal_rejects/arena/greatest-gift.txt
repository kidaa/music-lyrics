I awake to my beating heart
You save my soul from falling apart
Say goodbye I'm leaving the race
How I long for your embrace
How long did it take me to find
So close I won't be left behind
I believe and to you I confess
I gave up on me
But you showed me happiness

Your love is the greatest gift I could hope to receive
I'm on my way to being so complete
I'd make no change to a perfect idea
Your love is the greatest gift I have ever seen

I found was missing inside
No longer does this girl need to hide
Lay me down that I may be strong
'Cause together is surely where we belong

Nightly I pray, no harm befalls you
Needless to say, it's all I can do
Your every desire I promise no less
It's true I can say, because of you I've found happiness
