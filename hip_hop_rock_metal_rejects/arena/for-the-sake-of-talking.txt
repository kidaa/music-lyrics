Wheels within wheels 
You think you're such a big shot 
Manipulate, whoever you can 
Just as long as you get what you want 
You promise the world 
"Stick with me: and I'll make you a star 
'Cause I know the game 
I've got it all planned 
Without me you won't get very far 

You talk but you don't say anything 
You talk and your words don't mean a thing 
You just talk for the sake of talking 

Knowin' all the right people 
You've got an 'in' with everyone 
But I've heard from your so called friends 
And they're all sayin' your face is run 
Never admit to being wrong 
Keep losing in your quest for fame 
Look for the ladder in someone else's song 
Then at the top you shout your own name 

You talk but you don't say anything 
You talk and your words don't mean a thing 
You just talk for the sake of talking 

You talk but you don't say anything 
You talk and your words don't mean a thing 
You just talk for the sake of talking 

You talk as if you've been everywhere before 
You act as if you know so much more 
You never talk to, but you always talk down 
You wanna soar like an eagle 
But you're stuck on the ground 

You talk but you don't say anything 
You talk and your words don't mean a thing 
You just talk for the sake of talking 
[Repeat]

You talk but you don't say anything
