Heard a rumour 
You've been seen out late at night with a friend 
And there's a word that's going 'round 
That soon our love will end 
Heard a rumour 
I don't believe it 
It's all over town 
I won't believe it 

There's a story I heard 
That you've met somebody new 
That she's young and beautiful 
And means a lot to you 
Rumour has it 
I don't believe it 
It's all over town 
I won't believe it 

'Cause if you lied to me 
After all we had 
If you break us apart 
I'll be more than mad 
I won't believe it 

There'll be thunder on the mountain 
Darkness on the sea 
I've given everything
And you won't take that from me 
There's a rumour 
I won't believe it 
Rumour has it 
I can't believe it 

There are certain things I've heard 
You'll find hard to deny 
I'll accept it if you say 
It's just a pack of lies 
There's a rumour 
I don't believe it 
The word's been going 'round 
I won't believe it 

'Cause if you lie to me after all we had 
If you break us apart 
I'll be more than mad 
I won't believe it
