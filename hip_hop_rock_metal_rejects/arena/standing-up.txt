There was a time I was not so certain
All the games I played just multiplied the hurtin'
Mixed emotions
Never knowing right from wrong
I kept it all inside
Pretending to be strong
I'm a woman, to myself I must be true
Finally I believe I know just what to do

I'm standin' up, willin' and I'm able
Now I'm standing up for the first time in my life
I'm standing up, now I'm ready for love

I was pushed around until I came to find
My insecurity was just a state of mind
Even though I only had myself to blame
Now I've learnt to trust my heart
And I'll never be the same
I'm a woman, but just like anybody else
I've got a lot to give, don't wanna keep it to myself

I'm standin' up, willin' and I'm able
Now I'm standing up for the first time in my life
I'm standing up, now I'm ready for love
