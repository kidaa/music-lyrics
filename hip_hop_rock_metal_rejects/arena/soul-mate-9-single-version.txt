Soul Mate Number Nine,
You say that I'm the only one,
But I know it's just a lie.

Soul Mate Number Nine,
You're living in a fantasy,
In your mind.

You live in a made up world,
You think that I don't see,
It's a world of make believe.

You spin a tangled web,
Just like a fairy tail,
It's all in your head.

You promised me the world,
You promise me the sun,
You promise me heaven,
That you're gonna turn it 'round.

Soul Mate Number Nine,
You say that I'm the only one,
But I know it's just a lie.

Soul Mate Number Nine
You're living in a fantasy,
In your mind.

Soul Mate Number Nine.

You say you're a grown up man,
You've got it in control,
Your pockets lined in gold.

That's not what I need from you,
Just remember what you say,
It's only what you do.

You look into my eyes,
You try to hypnotise,
To say that it's forever,
But forever means good bye.

Soul Mate Number Nine.
Say that I'm the only one,
But I know that's just a lie.

Soul Mate Number Nine,
You're living in a fantasy,
In your mind.

Soul Mate Number nine.
I would have loved you,
If you'd just be who you are.

If you just say that you want me.
Let the feeling feel so real,
I feel you coming from the heart.

Soul Mate number nine,
Say that I'm the only one,
But I know that's just a lie.

Soul Mate Number Nine,
You're liven in a fantasy,
I'm your mind.
