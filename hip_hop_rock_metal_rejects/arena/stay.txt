As the days go by without number
One by one
As the clouds divide
I sit and wonder
When our time will come
From the Northern Lights 
To the Southern Cross
Between the earth and
The Milky Way
I must chart my course
As I go back and forth
And I wonder if it ever will change
Someday
Maybe not so far away
One day
I'll be in your arms to stay
You don't know what I'd give
You don't know how it is
You don't know what I'd give
So stay
Another day
