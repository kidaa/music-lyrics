duet with Rick Price

Discontent is in the air 
I feel it in my bones 
Chills me to the deepest reaches 
Of my weary soul 
You're always goin' your way 
Following you heart 
I wish you could be true to yourself 
Without tearing us apart

A house divided will not stand 
Everybody knows 
A house divided will not stand 
When the cold wind blows

Nothing's ever black and white 
There is no right or wrong 
But we just can't go on this way 
No not for very long 
Somewhere out across the sky 
Over the horizon 
Beyond the heights of the great divide 
A mighty storm is rising
