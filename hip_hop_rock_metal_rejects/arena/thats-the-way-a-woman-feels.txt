When the sky is gray and it looks like rain
Just think of me, I'll come running from wherever I am
Just as fast as I can
How could I ever stand by
And watch all your hopes and your dreams just die
On my word, I'll be there soon
I'm coming to the rescue

That's the way a woman feels
She'll walk through fire if she has to
That's the way a woman feels
When she loves someone, like I love you

When lightning strikes and the thunder rolls
And you can't find shelter from the cold
If you close your eyes and say a prayer, I'll be there
How could I turn away
From the one whose life I'd die to save
There's no sacrifice too great to make
When you are the reason

That's the way a woman feels
She'll walk through fire if she has to
That's the way a woman feels
When she loves someone, she'll be there for you

How could I ever stand by
And watch all your hopes and your dreams just die
On my word, I'll be there soon
I'm coming to the rescue
