Once again I sit and wonder
Was something I said so wrong
You're the one I really need now
Give me the strength to carry on
There again I'm falling, can you here me calling
I need you with me now

I've just got to get a message to you
It's only you I want to run to
I'll do anything I can do and I won't stop 'til I get through

I see myself pretending, afraid that I'll fall behind
When I close my eyes I feel you
Your tender touch keeps me alive how do I survive
When I can't, you say I can
No one else could understand the thoughts I keep inside

I've just got to get a message to you
It's only you I want to run to
I'll do anything I can do and I won't stop 'til I get through

I feel so alone, the feeling so strong
Your love sets me free, it's where I wanna be
I've just got to get a message to you
It's only you I want to run to
I'll do anything I can do and I won't stop 'til I get through
