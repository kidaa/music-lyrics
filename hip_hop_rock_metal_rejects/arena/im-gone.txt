I'm gone 
My spirit will take me somewhere 
I'm gone 
I'll be leaving before I get there 
I need to see 
I can be free inside of me 
I'm gone 
I know that a heart can be kind if broken 
Although it's a door that is always open 
I need to breathe 
I need to always believe 
Every time a tear is falling down like rain 
Everything that burns inside me still remains 
Yeah and it's true, my colour is blue 
But I know what I've got to do 
I'll carry on until the right one comes along 
I'm gone 
Inside 
I'm a million different rainbows 
I won't hide 
'Cause my light will shine through the shadows 
I'm gonna breathe 
I'm gonna always be me 
Every time a tear is falling down like rain 
Everything that burns inside me still remains 
Yeah and it's true, my colour is blue 
But I know what I've got to do 
I'll carry on until the right one comes along 
I'm gone 
I wake up in the middle of the night 
Cold sweat 'cause I lie here thinking of you 
I hope to god I can see the light 
No matter what, I'm gonna get it right 
Every time a tear is falling down like rain 
Everything that burns inside me still remains 
Yeah and it's true, my colour is blue 
But I know what I've got to do 
I'll carry on until the right one comes 
I'm gone 
Oh yeah, baby I'm gone 
Yeah and it's true, my colour is blue 
But I tell what I've got to do 
I'll carry on, until the right one comes along 
I'm gone 
Baby I'm gone 
I'm gone
