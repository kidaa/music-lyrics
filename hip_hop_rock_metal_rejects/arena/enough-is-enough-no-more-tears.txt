feat. Donna Summer

Raining, it's pouring
my lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
we don't stand a chance

I've always freamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
our love, our love

Raining raining
pouring pouring
there's nothing left for us here
and we won't waist another tear

 If you've had enough,
don't put up with is stuff,
don't you do it
 If you've had your fill,
get the check pay the bill,
you can do it

Tell him to just get out
Pack his raincoat, show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, Enough is enough, I want him out i want him out that door now 

I've always freamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
our love, our love..Our love, our love.

Enough is enough
I can't go on, Enough is enough, I want him out i want him out that door now
Enough is enough, is enough, is enough, etc...
