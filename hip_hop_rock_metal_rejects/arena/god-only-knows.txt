I took a ride that took me out of nowhere 
Life is an open door 
I took a chance on you when it was unclear 
What we were hoping for 
This world can be oh so cruel 
But I've paid my dues 
God only knows 
What you do to me 
Where we will be tomorrow 
If you should stay 
Please promise me nothin' 
'Cause god only knows 
I am just a traveller on a journey 
No destination sign 
Even when you're on the road to nowhere 
Take one step at a time 
'Cause life can be oh so cruel 
That's yesterday's news 
I can say it 
God only knows 
What you do to me 
Where we will be tomorrow 
If you should stay 
Please promise me nothin' 
Yeah 
God only cares 
When you're through 
To the bone, can you feel the sorrow 
If you should go 
Please promise me nothin' 
'Cause I'm alive and I'm here 
And I don't want to fear 
There are mountains to climb 
And this is my time 
I can say it, 
God only knows 
What you do to me 
Where we will be tomorrow 
If you should go 
Please ask me for nothing 
Yeah 
God only deals 
To the ones that he knows 
Have the strength to handle 
'Cause god always throws 
A line to the wanderer 
Who god only knows 
Yes god only knows 
Woah 
God only knows
