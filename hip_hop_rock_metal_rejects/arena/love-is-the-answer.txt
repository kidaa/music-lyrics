Imagine you, imagine me
We could be happy, we could be free
If we could only try
No more hunger, no more greed
Do you ever wonder, can you believe
This world's for us to share
'Cause I hope and I pray
Open our hearts and show us the way

I know love is the answer
And fear serves only to bind
Keep us all together
We all belong in heaven above

No more deception, no more war
And peace we would treasure for evermore
No need to be alone
'Cause I hope and I pray
Open our hearts and show us the way

I know love is the answer
And fear serves only to bind
Keep us all together
We all belong in heaven above
