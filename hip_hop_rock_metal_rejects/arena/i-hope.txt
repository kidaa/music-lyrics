I hope you can see the truth 
That I still trust in you 
This moment's here to stay 
Don't let it all just slip away 
So the demon has his way 
Please help me to believe 
That blessings come, from up above 
Deciding to move on 
Is never fun, for anyone 

Ask the angel for the way 
Maybe he will say your prayer 
So let me say 

I'll miss your call 
But I hope you'll find 
A heart that's worthy of your time 
I hope you may in every way 
Find what you are looking for 

yeah yeah 

Please don't you apologise 
Cos it takes two every time 
These moments are lessons for 
A soul to learn about this life 

Ask the angel for the way 
Maybe he will save the day 
So let me say 
I'll miss your call but I hope you'll find 
A heart that's worthy of your time 
I hope u may 
in every way 
Find what you are looking for 
I'll miss your call 
But I hope you'll find 

And every time I close my eyes 
You better believe in what I'm trying to say 
You may be asking yourself why, you did it 
And now it's just a matter of time 
Its just a question of time 
yeah yeah
