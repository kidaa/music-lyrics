I've seen it all 
I've soaked it in 
I've taken breaths in world's, you've never been 
I've tasted kisses 
Under influence 
It was beautiful, but there was no suspense 
Do you know what it feels like 
For a woman 
When the love is right 
Do you know what it's really like 
When you brave the fight 
And come home alive 
When you're a woman 
I've walked the line 
I've been undermined 
Put on a skirt even when it hurt, just to satisfy 
'Cause I've learned to abide 
Not allowed to cry 
I understand, I need to be a man, just to survive 
Do you know what it's really like 
For a woman 
When the love is right 
Do you know what it's really like 
When you brave the fight 
And come home alive 
When you're a woman 
I can change your world 
I can give you life 
I can sing you lullaby's at night 
I can see your eyes 
Before they flicker blind 
I can rescue you in the nick of time 
Oh, don't you know, 
What it feels like, For a woman 
When the love is right 
Do you know, what it's really like 
When you brave the fight 
And come home alive 
Yes, I'm a woman 
I'm a woman
