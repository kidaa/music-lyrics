Yeah, yeah

Don't you feel natural lying beside me
Running your fingers through my hair
A kiss so tender
Baby surrender
Is it so hard to say you care

Don't know how to take it
Don't know where we are
How we gonna make it
If you can't put your heart

On the line
Line, got to be willing
Let the way you're feeling
On the line

Try to imagine how it will sound
If you close your eyes and no words came out
It's so easy
Tell me the truth
Say you love me like I know you do
Where do we take it
How do we start
If you want us to make it
Got to put your heart

On the line
Line, got to be willing
Let the way you're feeling
On the line

On the line
Line, baby how willing
To let the way you're feeling
On the line

Oh I
Don't think that saying you love me
Make you less a man
I know it's not an easy thing
Come on put your heart
Put your heart in my hands
No, no, no
Baby I'm willing

Where do we take it
How do we start
If you want us to make it
Got to put your heart

On the line
Line, baby how willing
To let the way you're feeling
On the line

On the line
Line, got to be willing
To let the way you're feeling
On the line
