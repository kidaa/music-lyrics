Wonder if it's always been this bright 
I could never tell you where it all went wrong 
Because you were always right 
I could spend a lifetime handing out the blame 
I could call it all a big mistake 
But love that we are given never goes away 
It just changes every day 
Guess I'll find it if I wait 
And every day gets better, everything is almost fine 
'Cause every night I'm still pretending you're not on my mind 
But I lied 
There's nothing in your heart that I don't understand 
I know yesterday has come and gone 
Wishes are like water slipping through my hands 
And I never could hold on 
Truth is complicated when it comes to you 
Every edge is dangerously rough 
Nothing ever changes but my point of view 
And today I'll call it love 
As if calling was enough 
And every day gets better, everything is almost fine 
'Cause every night I'm still pretending you're not on my mind 
But I lied, But I lied, But I lied 
Stumbling through this journey is an uphill climb 
So much effort gone and more to come 
If I was to make love to you one more time 
Would I wonder what I had done Would I be the only one 
And every day gets better, everything is almost fine 
'Cause every night I'm still pretending you're not on my mind 
And every day gets better, everything is almost fine 
'Cause every night I'm still pretending you're not on my mind 
But I lied 
Yeah yeah
