Who knows what the future holds 
Who knows what tomorrow brings 
Somewhere there's a place for us I know 
You chose to go your own way 
Kept searching for brighter days 
But the feeling that keeps haunting you won't go 

I'll be here when you really want me 
I'll be here when you need me right here 
I'll be here when you're thinking of me 
I'll be here 
Waiting with my love to draw you near 

You won't ever find a love 
Like mine you were so certain of 
I gave it all to you and non-one else 
I'll hold on till time stands still 
But until you say you will 
Come back to me so we can love again 

I'll be here when you really want me 
I'll be here when you need me right here 
I'll be here when you're thinking of me 
I'll be here 
Waiting with my love to draw you near 

What we left behind was out key to love 
We both made our mistake 
But it's never too late 
To get back where we belong 

I'll be here when you really want me 
I'll be here when you need me right here 
I'll be here when you're thinking of me 
I'll be here 
Waiting with my love to draw you near 

I'll be here when you really want me 
I'll be here when you need me right here 
I'll be here when you're thinking of me 
I'll be here 
Waiting with my love to draw you near
