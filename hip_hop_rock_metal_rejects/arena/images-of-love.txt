One step forward 
Two steps back 
Everytime I meet someone new 
I draw another blank 
Circular motion 
It always ends up the same 
A voice in my head
Keeps on calling your name
Calling your name 

Images of love
Keep on coming back to haunt me
Images of love 
Keep on turnin' my mind around 
Images of love
Of when we were together
Images of love
Will haunt me forever
Forever

A flick of the wrist
Another roll of the dice 
One more chance for romance
But something makes me think twice
No physical intervention
You don't have to be there
'Cause I'm chained to your name
And the love that we shared
All the love that we shared

Images of love
Keep on coming back to haunt me 
Images of love
Keep on turnin' my mind around 
Images of love
Of when we were together
Images of love 

After all this time you are still on my mind 
I keep feelin' the hurt and livin' the pain  
'Cause no power on earth 
Can ever put out the flame

Images of love 
Keep on coming back to haunt me 
Images of love
Keep on turnin' my mind around
Images of love
Of when we were together 
Images of love 

Images of love 
Keep on coming back to haunt me
Images of love
Keep on turnin' my mind around 
Images of love
Of when we were together
Images of love
Will haunt me forever 
Forever

Images of love 
Images of love 
Images of love 
Images of love
