7:45 on the radio, and the voice says
Time to rise and shine 
Gotta get you up, then I disappear 
In the time that I'm away from you 
Gotta start the grind, gotta turn it on 
Make it happen, gotta use my mind 
Start again tonight with a fantasy 
But today it's just survival 
Trying to keep it all alive 

A woman's work is never done 
I don't stop take care of everyone 
A woman's work is never never done 

Stayin' home ain't easy and who's to say 
It don't count, if the job don't pay 
Workin' double duty, doin' overtime 
All I need is what I'm gettin' from you 
Takin' care of business with the money man 
Is a game, don't misunderstand 
Tonight you'll make it right, take me away 
All I need is some affection 
Shoot a little love in my direction 

A woman's work is never done 
I don't stop from dawn to setting sun 
A woman's work is never never done 

You should know 
What I need, yea 
Baby what you got 
What you got 
Won't ya show me some affection 
Shoot a little love in my direction 

A woman's work is never done 
I don't stop Take care of everyone 
A woman's work is never never done 

A woman's work is never done 
I don't stop from dawn to setting sun 
A woman's work is never never done
