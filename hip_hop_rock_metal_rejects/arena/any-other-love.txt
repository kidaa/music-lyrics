Window with a view
Sea breeze is blowing
Maybe together
We can't fight anymore
As long as you're the army
And I'll be your soldier
Tell me when to cover
May I come crashing through the door

Champagne and roses
Sit around just collecting the dust 
There is Jesus hanging on the wall
But really hear my call

Any other love
Wouldn't have the touch
Any other love
Would never be enough
I've got reasons in my head
So why didn't he get what I get
Cause any other love
Wouldn't be quite the same

Now I know it's true
The coming and going
Maybe that's better
Than what we had before
I got someone to charm me
Someone to hold me
And help me discover
What I've been searching for

Champagne and roses
Sit around just collecting the dust 
There is Jesus hanging on the wall
But really hear my call

Any other love
Wouldn't have the touch
Any other love
Would never be enough
I've got reasons in my head
So why didn't he get what I get
Cause any other love
Wouldn't be quite the same

Yet I thought I was dead
I was drowning in sorrow
No one to turn to
I was going out of my head
Yet you came through out of nowhere
And you help me believe in tomorrow

Any other love can wait
Any other love yeah yeah
I've got reasons in my head
So why didn't he get what I get
Cause any other love yeah
Wouldn't be, wouldn't be quite the same

I've got reasons in my head
Any other love yeah yeah
I've got reasons in my head yeah yeah
I've got reasons in my head
Any other love
