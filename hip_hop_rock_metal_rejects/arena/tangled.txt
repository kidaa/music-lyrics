I'm not sure, if I love 
Or I hate you 
I'm not sure of anything at all 
Why should I, have to hide 
What I'm feeling 
Deep inside I have the taste of you 
I'm so consumed, do I have to choose 
Tangled deep inside my emotions 
Twisted is it love or devotion 
Hands tied only to keep us tangled 
Do I want you tonight 
I'll never see you again 
Should I care about this at all 
I'm so confused, when it comes to you 
Tangled deep inside my emotions 
Twisted is it love or devotion 
Hands tied only to keep us tangled 
I don't know, what I need 
Outside of you, inside of me 
Tangled deep inside my emotions 
Twisted is it love or devotion 
Hands tied only to keep us, I'm so tangled inside 
Deep inside my emotions 
Is it love or devotion 
Only to keep us, tangled 
I'm so tangled inside 
Oh babe I know, I know, I know, I know 
I'm so tangled 
Only to keep us tangled 
Oh you know I'm twisted inside
