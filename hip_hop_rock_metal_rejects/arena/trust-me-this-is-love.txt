feat. Rick Price

I look at this mountain
So many heartaches wide
I can't help but wonder
Where's the other side

I've got to be honest
I've got my doubts
And your tears are asking me
What's this got to do with love

Darling please, tell me something
To help me through this long dark night

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love
Survives another test of faith
You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
Trust me baby, this is love

Love isn't easy, I'm torn, I confess
When a heart isn't certain
It's bound to second guess
This love won't forsake us
So dry your tears, I promise you

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love
Survives another test of faith
You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
Trust me baby, this is love

Here forever, there's nothing I want more
Our day is coming
And we'll reach that peaceful shore

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love
Survives another test of faith
You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now
Trust me baby, this is love

One more mountain ain't so wide
Trust me baby this is love
