Every dreamer needs a dream
sometimes I just wanna scream
everybody needs a shock

We are dreamers and we know
got to let your spirit go
everybody needs to rock

Chorus:
Turn up the beat
turn up the beat, lets make some noise
get on your feet, you got no choice
you've got the power in your hand
Turn up the beat
turn up the beat, lets have some fun
come on and dance now everyone
we're gonna generate some heat
turn up the beat

They can't make the music stop
they can't stop us when we're hot
raise your hands and celebrate

Turn the music up and loud
we are young and we are proud
and this feeling just can't wait

Chorus

Turn it up x4

Chorus til fade
