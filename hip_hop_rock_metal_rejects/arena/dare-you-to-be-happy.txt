I dare you to be happy, 
hit it 
What does it take 
Stop me making the same mistake 
Now I see, it's not me 
What a fool I've been 
Yeah Yeah 
I'm not ashamed 
Everybody can play that game 
It's ok, it's one way 
And we all survive 
You talk about my freedom 
Talk about my love 
Talk about my living 
And I know that's not enough 
I just want my freedom 
I just want to love 
I just wanna know that I can have a little fun 
Oh Oh 
I dare you to be happy 
Oh Woah 
I dare you to be happy 
Yeah 
Go figure it out 
Oh this is what the world's about 
I can tell, what the hell 
I can be there too 
Yeah Yeah 
At the end of the day 
I'm feeling good and I'm on my way 
When in doubt 
Leave it out 
Put your faith in life 
Woah 
We can talk about freedom 
We can talk about love 
We can talk about livin' 
But somehow that's not enough 
I just want to be givin' 
I just wanted to love 
Now I know it's time to have a little fun 
Woah Oh
