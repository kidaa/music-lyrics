We got together
And then we fell apart
We had to move on
And make a brand new start

Time went on You started missing me
Realise You could be kissing me
Now you're here Here to stay
I wouldn't have it any other way

Oh ...
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh ...
I wouldn't change a thing
No ...

Sometimes a breakup
Can really bring you down oh so down 
But then it's better
The second time around

You and I We just belong together
Can't deny But baby we could never
Be apart For very long
Cause what we got is just too strong

Oh ...
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh ...
I wouldn't change a thing
No ...
Oh ...

After you put your whole heart and soul in it baby
Sometimes you still got to lose your love to the end
We begin, we begin, we begin again
Baby, baby, we begin again

Oh ...
I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh ... 
Baby, I wouldn't, I wouldn't
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh ...
Oh ...
