I'm leaving now
Sixteen years and comes to this
Parting lines and a final kiss
Your hands are shaking
A cab waits in the rain
Now I've never felt more alone
I can't believe that these days are gone
After all that we've begun
You say you'll be there
I just have to call
Must you choose between 
Me and all your dreams
When you can be free right here with me
Those sixteen years
Don't they mean anything to you
How can you leave
With so much to loose
When you walk away
You're taking the morning from my day
Show me the pain
That's inside of you
I need to understand
Sixteen years now my thoughts run wild
How you held me like a child
I'll fight these tears 
But I can hide the way I feel
When you find what you want
Isn't it all you need
With you wanna run right back to me
Those sixteen years
Don't they mean anything to you
How can you leave
There's so much to loose
Oh when you walk away
You're taking the morning form my day
Show me the pain that's inside of you
Time moves on
And you'll be gone
And I hold on to the finer things
I need to keep me strong
But one sweet day
We'll put them all away 
I'll hope you know that no one stays the same
Those sixteen years
Don't they mean anything to you
How can you leave
There's so much to loose
Yeah
When you walk away
You're taking the morning from my day
Show me the pain that's inside of you
I need to understand
Someday you'll understand
Yes you will
