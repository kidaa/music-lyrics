Today I'm in the middle
Of getting by
I had a premonition
Let me tell you why
I still think about you baby
More than a memory
A flame that will not die
Let me tell ya'
You wanna know it 
Yeah
I'm havin' a flashback
Tonight
I just need to walk about for a while
Cause you're not understanding me
So just close your eyes and try
Tonight
I know there's is no turning back
This time
If you're not understanding me
Well then close your eyes and try
Baby
You've just gotta try
The four walls that surround me
As I'm reeling through the years
Still echo with the feelings
The laughter and the tears
Ahh lets talk about it baby
Lets rise above it all
And get on with our lives
Let me tell ya'
You wanna know it
Yeah
I'm havin' a flashback
Tonight
I just wanna walk about
For a while
Cause you're not understanding me
So close your eyes and try
Tonight
I just wanna walk about
For a while
But baby
Can't you see 
What it's doin' to me 
Open up your heart and 
Set those demons free
Baby baby
I'm havin' a flashback
Tonight
I just need to walk about
For a while
Cause you're not understanding me
So just close your eyes and try
Tonight
I know there is no turning back
This time
Try and understand me
Just close your eyes and try
Can't you see that it's a flashback
Oh flashback
Ooh whoo ooh yeah
Baby it's a flashback
Aah come on
Baby lets walk about for a while
Ooh understand me
Understand me
It's a flash back
Oh flashback
I know there is no turning back now
You're not understanding me
