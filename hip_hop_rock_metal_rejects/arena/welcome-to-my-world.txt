Come inside
Sit yourself down beside me
Help me find
The way to heal what divides me
Please take my shield
That hides my heart
Pull the curtains far apart
Welcome to my world
I've waited oh so long
For you to share my crazy life
Welcome to my
Welcome to my world
My world
Come prepared
Expect to see the unexpected
Cause I'm not scared
No I'm not
Can't you see we're connected baby
Oh don't you know
The road you're on
Only leads where you belong
Welcome to my world
I've waited oh so long
For you to share my crazy life 
Welcome to my
Welcome to my world
My world
Oh yeah
Same days there's a river of raging pain
Some days there's a lover 
To drive you in sane
But what you give me
I don't really mind
All I ask is please be kind
Welcome to my world
I've waited oh so long
You'd have shared my crazy life
Then welcome to my
Welcome to my
Welcome to my world
This is my world
My world
This'll be the rest of my life
Cause I know
My world
Waited oh so long
Welcome to my world
This is the rest of my life
