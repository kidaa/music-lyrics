Ave Maria 
Please pardon me 
Of in your house
I have come stealing 

Ave Maria 
No one ever taught me 
About kneeling 

Ave Maria 
Please will you keep me 
From the misery, madness, and fools 
Who rule this evil world? 

Ave Maria 
I'm a stranger and you're my last recourse 

Ave Maria 
Please can't you hear me 
Please take me down all these walls between us 
We all should be as one 

Ave Maria
Please watch over my life night and day 

Ave Maria 
Oh ! Please protect me 
Please guard me and my love now I pray 

Ave Maria
