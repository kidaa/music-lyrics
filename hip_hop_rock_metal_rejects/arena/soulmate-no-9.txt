Soulmate No.9
Say that I'm the only one
But I know that's just a lie
I'm your Soulmate No. 9
You're living in a fantasy, in your mind
Woah woah woah woah

You live in a made up world
You think that I don't see
It's a world of make believe
You spin a tangled web
Just like a fairytale
It's all in your head

You promised me the world
You promised me the sun light of sunrise
You promised me heaven
But your gonna turn it round

[CHORUS]
'Cause Soulmate No.9
Say that I'm the only one
But I know that's just a lie
I'm your Soulmate No. 9
You're living in a fantasy, in your mind
Soulmate No. 9

You say you're a grown up man
You've got it in control, your pockets lined in gold
That's not what I need from you
It's never what you say
It's only what you do

You look into my eyes
You try to hypnotise
You say that it's forever
But forever means goodbye

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[Bridge]
I would have loved you
If you'd just be who you are
If you just say that you want me
And let the feeling feel so real
I feel you, coming from the heart

[REPEAT CHORUS X 2]
Soulmate No. 9

Hey hey, woah woah woah woah

[REPEAT CHORUS]
