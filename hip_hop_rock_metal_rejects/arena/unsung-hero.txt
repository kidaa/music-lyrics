You sit in silence in the shadows
You don't complain or citicise
And while the world may see me as a fool
They're not looking through your eyes
No questions asked
You're there 
When I need you
With a love that inspires
Me to be
Everything you deserve
Cause you're my
Unsung hero
And I know it's not easy
To walk in your shoes
Day after day
You continue to amaze me
Now I sing this song of love
For you
While other long to steal the spotlight
You work your magic quietly
Cause you're not in it for the glory
The love you give comes naturally 
I may not have much
What I have
I give it to you
This song that I sing
Is my gift
And I swear that I mean every word
Cause you're my
Unsung hero
And I know it's not easy
To walk in your shoes
Day after day
You continue to amaze me
Now I sing this song of love
For you
My unsung hero
And I know it's not easy
To walk in your shoes
Day after day
You continue to amaze me
Now I sing this song of love
For you
Now I sing this song of love
For you
Sing this song of love 
Sing this song of love
I'll sing it for you baby
Sing it for you
You are my hero
