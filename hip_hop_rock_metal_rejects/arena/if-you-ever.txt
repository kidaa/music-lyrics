We are not strangers 
Could we have met some place before 
Am I in danger of myself 
You're like a magnet 
You pull me right across the room 
It's like were thinking out loud 
I can feel an unexplained connection 
I can feel your undivided attention 
I know that you're with somebody else 
But I do 
Feel like I have loved you 
In another place and time 
If it's true 
Then I'll be waiting for you 
If you ever change your mind 
Let me change your mind 
You leave me breathless 
While sweet seduction takes a hold 
You lied to everybody else 
I can feel an unexplained connection 
I can feel your undivided attention 
I know that we have to say good bye 
But I do 
Feel like I have loved you 
In another place and time 
If it's true 
Then I'll be waiting for you 
If you ever change your mind 
If you ever change your mind 
If you ever realise 
That it's me you want in your life 
You know where to find me 
If you ever change your mind 
Yeah ,Yeah, Yeah... 
But I do 
Feel like I have loved you 
In another place and time 
If it's true 
Then I'll be waiting for you 
If you ever change your mind 
Woah 
If you ever change your mind 
Baby change your mind 
I'll be waiting... 
If You ever, ever change your mind 
Baby change your mind 
Woah change your mind 
Woah
