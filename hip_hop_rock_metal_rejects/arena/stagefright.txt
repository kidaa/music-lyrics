Walking in the shadows 
Constantly evading the light 
Shattered dreams cry out 
As you move through the night 
Cautiously I look around 
A sense of fear tells me you're near 
Suddenly I catch a glimpse of that frozen state 

Stagefright whenever I see you 
Stagefright whenever I'm near you 
Stagefright stagefright 
Whenever it's you 

I know I should just walk away 
But the feeling's so hard to ignore 
Magnetic eyes hypnotize 
As you peer through the door 
You know my every weakness 
You control the movement and sound 
From the dark I hear you voice 
But there's no-one around 

Stagefright whenever I see you 
Stagefright whenever I'm near you 
Stagefright stagefright 
Whenever it's you 

You speak my name and I'm breathless 
I can't run I can't hide wanna scream 
All motion stops as if in a dream 
Just one more hour to midnight 
The witching hour is at hand 
There's no use running 
Now I know I'm part of your plan 

Stagefright whenever I see you 
Stagefright whenever I'm near you 
Stagefright stagefright 

Stagefright whenever I see you 
Stagefright whenever I'm near you 
Stagefright stagefright 

Stagefright whenever I see you 
Stagefright whenever I'm near you 
Stagefright whenever I see you 
Stagefright whenever I'm near you
