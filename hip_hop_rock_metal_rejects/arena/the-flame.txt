Is this the hope of the world in my hands
I'll take this moment, to be all that I can
Look to you to see the future
Stronger and free

Today we will show who we are
We are the earth
And we're together again
My friends, will you show us the way
We travel on, guided by the flame

The fire within makes you reach out to the goal
You redefine the best, by stretching the soul
A world in need of inspiration
And looks to you and me

Today we will show who we are
We are the earth
And we're together again
My friends, will you show us the way
We travel on, guided by the flame

Since ancient times we've come together
In the light of the flame
To stand for all the world to see
People reaching out to greatness
And all we can be

Today we will show who we are
We are the earth
Together again
Today you will show who you are
The best on earth, and you bring the world together again
My friends, you have shown us the way
Look to your heart
You will find the flame
