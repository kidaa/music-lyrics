I was lost in a world looking inside 
And no one could hear me 
I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else 
When no one can see me lying, I'm crying 
I need some peace 
But I haven't found it 
Something's gotta change 
Nothing stays the same 
Something's gotta change 
'Cause I can't live this way yeah 
I've had love, like a drug running though me 
But nothing that's lasting 
Turn my cheek, when a man gets weak 
Too guilty to speak, when nobody asks me 
That's passed me 
I am sad, but I'm still laughing 
Something's gotta change 
'Cause nothing stays the same 
Something's gotta change yeah 
'Cause I can't live this way 
Something's gotta change 
Nothing stays the same 
Something's gotta change 
'Cause I can't live this way 
Somebody open a door 
Somebody give me something more 
'Cause for sure 
Something's gotta change 
Something's gotta change 
'Cause I can't live this way 
Something's gotta change 
Oh Woah Yeah 
'Cause nothing stays the same 
Something's gotta change 
Yeah 
'Cause I can't live this way 
Something's gotta 
Something's gotta change
