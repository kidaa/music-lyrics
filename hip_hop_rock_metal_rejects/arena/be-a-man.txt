If you think I'm satisfied
If you believe everything's al right
Then you don't know day from night
You don't see the tears I cry, can't you see I feel the fire
I can't deny the way you touch that desire in me
Oh baby, God knows you do, like nobody can

So baby, baby be a man
Baby be a man, baby be a man, be a man to me
I'm doing everything I can to make you understand
Be a man to me

Used to be love at all hours
I never got a good night's sleep
Now it's hard to believe not long ago
You couldn't get enough of me
I know that you can deliver
Why don't you lay down and give it to me
If you don't want me to leave, just take my hand

And baby, baby be a man
Baby be a man, baby be a man, be a man to me
I'm doing everything I can to make you understand
If you want me for your woman, then baby, baby, baby

Come to me, talk to me, tell me what's wrong
But baby don't keep me waiting too long
I can't hold on
