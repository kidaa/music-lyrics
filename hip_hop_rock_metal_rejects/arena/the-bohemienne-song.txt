Bohemienne
No one knows where my story begins 
Bohemienne I was born on a road that bends 
Bohemienne, bohemienne 
Come tomorrow, I'll wander again 
Bohemienne, bohemienne
Here's my fate in the lines of my hands 

My mother told me tales of Spain 
I think that's where she longed to be 
Of mountain bandits she once sang 
Andalusia memory 
There in the mountains she was free 

My mother, father all are gone 
And I've made Paris be my home 
I dream of oceans rolling on
They take my heart where I must come 
Andalusia mountain home 

Bohemienne 
No one knows where my story begins 
Bohemienne I was born on a road that bends 
Bohemienne, bohemienne 
Come tomorrow, I'll wander again 
Bohemienne, bohemienne 
Here's my fate in the lines of my hands 

When I was a child in Provence 
Barefoot in the hills I dance once 
But the gypsy road is long 
The road's so long 

Every day I see a new chance
Maybe some road will lead from France 
I will follow till I come home 
Till I come home 

Andalusia's streams 
Run through my blood 
Run through my day dreams 
Andalusia's sky 
When it calls me 
I feel my heart fly 

Bohemienne 
No one knows where my story begins 
Bohemienne I was born on a road that bends 
Bohemienne, bohemienne 
Come tomorrow, I'll wander again 
Bohemienne, bohemienne 
Here's my fate in the lines of my hands 
Here's my fate in the lines of my hands
