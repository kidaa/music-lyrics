Listen to me now
Wanna be's
That's all they are and all they'll ever be
Not like me
I know the rules and how it's gonna be
Imagining
The dream that is the heart of everything
Then you do
What must be done to make it true
But when at last I finally touch the stars
I'll still be who I am yeah
Cause I know where I come from
And who's in command
When I fall
I'll read the writing screaming off the wall
Learn it all
But I'll be careful with who I call
Cause philosophy won't save you when you're public property
Yeah
Psychology oh baby
Is all you offer me yeah
But when at last I finally touch the stars
I'll still be who I am yeah
Cause I know where I come from
And who's in command
Oh I'm telling you
But when at last I finally touch the stars
I'll still be who I am
Cause I know where I come from
And who's in command
I'd give it all yeah
I'd give it all in a day
Cause I'm telling you
And when I finally walk among the stars
I'll still be who I am
Cause I know where I come from
And who's in command
Yes I am
Ooh
Cause I know where I come from
And who's in command oh yeah
Oh yeah
Cause I know where I come from
I'm in command
I'm in command
Yes I'm in command
Oh yeah yeah
