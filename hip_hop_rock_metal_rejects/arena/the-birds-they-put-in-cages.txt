feat. Garou

[Esmeralda]
Will the birds they put in cages
Ever ride upon the wind 
Will the children life outrages 
Ever learn to love again 

I lived my life like a swallow 
I arrived here with the springtime
All the little streets I'd follow 
All the gypsy song were mine 

Where's my friend who rings the church bells  
Where are you my Quasimodo  
They will hang me as the light swells 
You can break these bars I know 

[Quasimodo]
Esmeralda, have you left me  
Do you hide yourself away 
I have counted every hour 
I have missed you every day 

Have you left upon a journey
With your handsome, shining soldier 
With no marriage, taking love free 
Like the gypsy girl you are  

Have you died out in the small streets 
With no prayer to get to Heaven  
There's a priest who counts tour heartbeats
If he comes near, you must run 

[Esmeralda]
You remember at the street fair

[Quasimodo]
When they hurt me on the great wheel 

[Esmeralda]
When you begged, I gave you water

[Quasimodo]
At your feet I had to kneel 

Quasimodo and Esmeralda
On that day our friendship started
It will last as long as we live
Once together never parted
All we have to give we'll give
Will the birds they put in cages
Ever ride upon the wind 
Will the children life outrages 
Ever learn to love again
