She'll suck the living down to size three 
She'll suck the living and she'll kill me 
Necks are crooked and it's time to sing 
Her beak is wide open at the sound of wings 
Oh ay 

She kisses harder than me 
She kisses harder than me 
I guess I'm not that hungry 

Veins are rivers flowing to the sea 
Fish will eat it, but don't ask me 
Angels looking make it hard to cry 
People looking make it cool to die 
Oh ay 

She kisses harder than me 
She kisses harder than me 
I guess I'm not that hungry 
She kisses harder than me 
She kisses harder than me 
I guess I'm not that hungry
