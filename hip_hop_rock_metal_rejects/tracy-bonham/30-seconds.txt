For every stone there's a rock 
Waiting for someones head 
Here it come, and you wish you had two heads 
30 seconds. 30 seconds. 
Sell half your soul 
And you realize that you are 
No one. no one. no one. 

For every star 
There's another one that's fading 
Fading away, hating every bit of life 
30 seconds. 30 seconds. 

One day of sun 
And the rest you're spending as a 
No one. no one. no one. no one. 

Out of my way 
Out of my way 
Before you know you're 
Out of my way 
Out of my way 

For everyone there's another one that's stronger 
So out you go like the trash that you drug in 
30 seconds. 30 seconds. 

Paving the way 
For the ones who made you feel like 
No one. no one. no one. no one. 

Out of my way 
Out of my way 
Before you know you're 
Out of my way 
Out of my way
