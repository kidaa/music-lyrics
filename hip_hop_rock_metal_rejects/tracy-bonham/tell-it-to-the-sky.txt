It makes you weak 
It makes you strong 
Been in your blood too long 
I took your nights 
You took my star 
One I wished on last year 

Tell it to the sky 
Tell it to the sky 
For no one 
So you fucked all 
All that we had 
I took the ball and ran 

It makes you weak 
It makes you strong 
Been in your blood too long 

Tell it to the sky 
Tell it to the sky 
Tell it to the sky 
For no one 
Tell it to the sky 
Tell it to the sky 
For no one 
I see you.. coming back to me 
I hear you're coming back 
To me 

Tell it to the sky..for no one
