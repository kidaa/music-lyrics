I sleep the day away giving you all I can 
Ready to reach new lows dying to wash my hand 

You're the one, you're the one that froze the sun 
Say you love me as you pull the trigger 
Better today rather than tomorrow 

Heaven is in the air hiding behind your blinds 
Heaven is right out there leaving me here behind 

You're the one, you're the one that froze the sun 
Say you love me as you pull the trigger 
Better today rather than tomorrow 

You're the one, you're the one that froze the sun 
Say you love me as you pull the trigger 
Better today rather than tomorrow 

You, you should enjoy the weather 
Soon you'll burn with what you've done 

You'll hurt no one 
You'll hurt no one 
You'll hurt no one 

I sleep the day away giving you all I can 
Ready to reach new lows dying to wash my hand
