This damn bean won't jump for you anymore Jumping bean won't jump for you 
anymore 
Keep on moving 
This damn pea won't split for you anymore Damn shine won't spit for you anymore 
Keep on moving 
I can't be your jumping bean anymore 
I can't be your beauty queen anymore 
I won't jump for your team anymore 
This damn bush won't burn for you anymore 
Beer can won't learn for you 
anymore 
Keep on moving 
This damn horse won't buck for you anymore 
Damn lips won't suck for you 
anymore 
Keep on moving Keep on moving 
I can't be your burning bush anymore I can't be the one you touch 
anymore 
I won't be the perfect rush anymore 
I can't be your jumping bean anymore I won't be your beauty queen 
anymore 
I can't jump for your team anymore 
I can't be your jumping bean anymore I won't be your Krispy Kreme 
anymore 
I can't jump for your team anymore 
I won't wear that navy bean anymore I can't be your beauty queen anymore 
I won't be your hit machine anymore
