Little man big heart said to big man little heart 'I got what I want 
I got what I want 
I got what I need But you can't always not get what you don't want 
Flaunt what you got and what you got flaunt Speak double doom as much as 
you want but you can't always not get what you don't But you might get 
what you need 
Street smart big mind said to little learned book brain 'I got what I 
want I got what I want I got what I need But you can't always not get 
what don't want Flaunt what you got and what you got flaunt 
Speak double doom as much as you want but you can't always not get what you don't But 
you might get what you need
