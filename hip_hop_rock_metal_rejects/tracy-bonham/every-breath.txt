I see you runnin and it's all over now 
The devil's comin and he's showin us how 
He's goin down on the street light 
It's such a cool sight 
The lizard king is here and where are you now 
The monkey brain is here he's showing us how 
He's goin down on the cool right 
And I am loosing sight..and... 

Every breath is like the one before 
Yeah it's like the one before 
You get it right you breathe no more 

Sold my shadow on the blackest of nights 
Sometimes it pushed me right out of the light 
It's going down on the cool right and I am losing 
Your're here to tempt me and it's all I can do 
To keep from running just to try something new 
I'm goin down on the cool ride and i am right behind...and.. 

Every breath is like the one before 
Yeah it's like the one before 
You get it right you breathe no more 
No more 
No more 

Every breath is like the one before 
Yeah it's like the one before 
You get it right you breathe no more 
Every breath is like the one before 
Yeah it's like the one before 
You bank on it you breathe no more 
No more
