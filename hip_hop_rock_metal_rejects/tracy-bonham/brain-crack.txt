Have you ever heard the sound 
Of you head in the ground 
And you're afraid to say 
And it won't go away 

That's the sound of your brain cracking 
That's the sound of your brain cracking 
That's the sound of your brain cracking 
That's the sound of your brain cracking 

Have you ever heard the sound 
Of you head on the ground 
And you're afraid to say 
And it won't go away 

That's the sound of your brain cracking 
That's the sound of your brain cracking 
That's the sound of your brain cracking 
That's the sound of your brain cracking
