Headache. The girl she says she's got a headache 
What she needs is just a handshake 
Squeezing out all of the bad excuses she can make 
Mornings- There will be some ugly mornings 
But at least I'll know what love means 
Love that lets me be as human as can be 
I don't have to fake it 
I won't have to lead you on 
I'm as real as they come and 
I don't see how some women put you on 
Fakers With your lipo and your lipstick 
You make it easy for a real chick 
To see the horror pouring out of your ruby lips 
Perfect I thank God that I'm not perfect 
I happen to like all my defects 
But my TV don't agree and I don't give a shit 
I won't have to fake it 
I don't have to put you on 
I'm as real as they come 
And I don't see how some women lead you on 
I won't have to fake it 
I won't have to put you on 
And I don't like the way that I'm put on display 
For your sorry eyes sorry eyes 
Here comes the real one 
Here comes the real thing 
Here comes the real one 
I don't have to fake it 
I don't have to put you on 
I'm as real as they come 
And I don't see how some women lead you on 
I don't have to fake it 
I won't have to lead you on 
And I don't understand why would a man 
Want a circus clown
