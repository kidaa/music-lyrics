Mother mother how's the family, I'm just calling to say hello 
How's the weather how's my father am I lonely heavens no 
Mother mother are you listening, just a phone call to ease your mind 
Life is perfect never better, distance making the heart grow blind 

When you sent me off to see the world, where you scared that I might get hurt 
Would I try a little tobacco, would I keep on hiking up my skirt 

I'm hungry 
I'm dirty 
I'm losing my mind 
Everything's fine 

I'm freezing 
I'm starving 
I'm bleeding to death 
Everything's fine 

Yeah, I'm working, making money I'm just starting to build a name 
I can feel it around the corner, I could make it any day 
Mother mother can you hear me, sure I'm sober sure I'm sane 
Life is perfect never better, still your daughter still the same 

If I tell you what you want to hear, will it help you to sleep well at night 
Are you sure that I'm your perfect dear, now just cuddle up and sleep tight 

I'm hungry 
I'm dirty 
I'm losing my mind 
Everything's fine 

I'm freezing 
I'm starving 
I'm bleeding to death 
Everything's fine 

I miss you 
I love you
