A navy bean is bigger than it seems put it on and don't ask what it means 
Parade around 
Cellophane is thicker than it seems put it on and don't ask what it means 
Parade around 
Shaving cream is thicker than it seems shave 'em off and don't ask what it means 
Parade around 
An angel wing is caught up in the tree if you know what's best get the hell away from me! 
Parade around 
Oh you little navy bean oh you're caught up in the tree 
Navy bean, navy bean 
Oh you little navy bean oh you're caught up in the tree 
Navy bean, navy bean, navy bean, navy bean 

Cellophane is thicker than it seems put it on and don't ask what it means 
Parade around
