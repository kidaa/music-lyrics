I've got my heart crammed in a bottle 
And all the while I fought so little 
What is this fear we hold so deeply 
To stand alone alone completely? 
It's do or die It's now or never 
It's cats and dogs It's helter skelter 
'till I'm 
Free Yeah free 
Something inside me is begging to be free 
We hardly live for fear of dying 
Then fall asleep and call it living 
I hardly love for fear of losing 
I'll hardly loose but I'm not loving 
'till I'm 
Free yeah free 
Something inside me is begging to be free
