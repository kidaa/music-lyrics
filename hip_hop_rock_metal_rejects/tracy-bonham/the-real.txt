I know the sun's around 
To wake the dead 
You've got if anything 
A bigger head 
Most likely to perform 
Was who I knew 
But now it's you that I have to know 
Silly who ya know 
Has got away 
Sweet little who ya know 
Lives in L.A. 
Most likely to conceive 
Was who I knew 
But now it's you that I have to know 
Only the real world 
Is so unreal 
Only the real is real 

Pocket the business card 
Be on your way 
Pocket the smiling face 
And save the day 

Most likely to perform 
Was who I knew 
But now it's you that I have to know 
Only the real world is so unreal 
Only the real is real
