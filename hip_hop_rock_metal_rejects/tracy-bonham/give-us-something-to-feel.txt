We live and by the dust devil's sanction 
We live here by the dust devil's family 
Waiting for him we're all waiting for him 
Come to our emotional desert 
Come to our emotional desert 
Then leave us high 
Then leave us high and dry 
Give us something to feel 
I fell far from the tree of knowledge 
I fell far from the tree of knowing 
What to feel do you know what we feel? 
Come to our emotional vacuum 
Come to our 
emotional vacuum 
Then leave us high 
Then leave us high and dry 
Give us something to feel
