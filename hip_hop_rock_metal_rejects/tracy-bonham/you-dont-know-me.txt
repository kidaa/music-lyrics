You say you knew Jackie Onassis 
When she was an actress 
You say you knew Buffalo Bill 
Before he could kill 
You've got your head twisted 'round the back 
So you can't see 
My life colliding with your life 
And you say you know me 
But you don't know me 
You don't know me 
And in no way am I a mystery 
Just hang a bell around my neck 
And call me ol' bessie Yeah take that cattle prod back 
Before I see red 
You've got your neck twisted 'round the back 
So you can't see 
My horns colliding with your ass 
'cause you think you own me 
But you don't know me 
You don't know me 
And in no way am I a mystery 
You don't know me 
You don't know me 
And your thickness is hard to believe
