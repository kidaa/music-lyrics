You've got a rocket 
Inside your bullet head 
I've seen you walk it baby 
Your knack for greatness 
Has never done you wrong 
You showed that sweet old lady 

Who's got the bulldog 
Who's got the bulldog 
Who's got the bulldog down below 

You talk of genius 
I feel an undertow 
Which head of yours is bragging now 
One made of lettuce is smarter than you both 
You showed that manhole anyhow 

Who's got the bulldog 
Who's got the bulldog 
Who's got the bulldog down below 

He'll bend you over 
Little red rover 
Bend you right over 
Some casanova 
Go to your momma 
Little chihuahua 
Get back to your momma 
Little chihuahua 

Oh, the bulldog!!! 
Oh, the bulldog!!! 

Who's got the bulldog 
Down below
