They call you the one hit wonder 
If I could just hit you right 
Yeah right between yeah right between 
Your eyes 
If ever a girlie wonder 
Could ever be more than just 
One thing yeah more than one 
Thing at a time 

I give you my four leaf clover 
Cause God only knows that is 
The only one the only one 
Of mine 
And you'll hear it over and over 
Until it is built right in yeah right into 
Your filthy little mind 

I own the world 
I bought the whole damn world 
From the man who sold the world 
A million dollar caddy world 

So could you just bend right over 
To see how it feels to be 
To see just how it feels 
To be alive 

And you'll get it over and over 
Cause God only knows that is 
The only one the only one 
Of mine 

I own the world 
I bought the whole damn world 
From the man who sold the world 
A million dollar cranky world
