What's the matter? The new millennia the new millennium's a chewin' at 
you, 
The Californians the headless horsemen the number zero the number 
zero 
That little goose egg it eats the world and the people in it a can you 
hear me? 
Life's a battle Life's a battle Hallelujah Hallelujah 
It may be a cold day in hell 
It may be a cold day in hell 
Sit and spin well you're wearing thin and the "forni-gate" it's a bit 
too late for it 
It's getting hotter we're getting hotter The only good news is hell 
feels cooler 
Life's a battle Life's a battle HallelujAh Hallelujah 
It may be a cold day in hell The hotter we get the harder to tell 
It may be a cold day in hell The hotter we get the harder to tell
