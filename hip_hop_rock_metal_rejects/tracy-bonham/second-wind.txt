Second wind calling all the forces in I'm in need of a second wind 
A second wind down here 
Saving grace calling every puckered face I'm in need of a saving grace 
A saving grace down here 
Wake the thunder lightly whisper in his ear in his ear Tell him 
We're in need of stirring things down here Down here 
Wicked wind you taught us how to love again While rain and thunder are 
threatening they're circling us here 
Wake the lightening softly whisper in her ear in her ear Tell her 
We're in need of finishing things down here Down here
