Mmm- Set your wildabeast free 
Mmm- Let your lady bug be 
Gladiolas don't go to sleep 'til dawn 
Sexy people sleep with their hair do's on 
Mmm- let your jack hammer sing 
Mmm- pretty angels get wings 
Thumbelina girl with her tongue tucked in 
Angry woman caught with her mouth again 
Margaritas walk with their hips 
And win in the end 
One day when everyone's gone 
What will it matter what kind trip you're on 
Mmm- Give your soul sucker gin 
Mmm- Let your sore loser win 
Pretty people swim with their lipstick on 
Little matches sleep with their lashes long 
Margaritas walk with their hips 
And prove me all wrong 
One day when everyone's gone 
What will it matter what kind of trip you're on 
One day when we're all gone 
What will it matter what kind of spell you're on 
Thumbelina caught with her tongue tucked in 
Yellow belly ran from the rain again 
What will it matter 
Who's watching in the end 
One day when we're all gone 
What will it matter 
What kind of trip you're on 
One day when we're all gone 
What will it matter 
What really turned you on
