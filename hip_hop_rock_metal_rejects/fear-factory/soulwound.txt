A tortured whipping dog defiled
Stalked by oblivion and denial
Scarring lacerations
Hopeless devistation 

The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper, deeper, deeper 

These wounds are small slices of death
Draining my soul and final breath
Self-inflicted dementia
Bone shallow gravedigger 

[Repeat second verse]

[Chorus:]
Soulwound
Soulwound [x2]

[Repeat chorus]

Soulwounds I can not conceal
These wounds are so hard to heal 

[Repeat first verse]

[Repeat second verse]
