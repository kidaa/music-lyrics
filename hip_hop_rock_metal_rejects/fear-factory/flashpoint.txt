I lied
Right to your face
And I'll burn
In flames
Instinct
Has failed me now
Enslaved
By my deceit
Lies sink in like gasoline
Saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty
And that will be the death of me
Damned
In flames
Damned
In flames
Damned
In flames
Damned
In flames
Lies engulf me
Lies they burn me
Lies they purge me
Lies they free me
Lies sink in like gasoline
Saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty
And that will be the death of me
Damned
In flames
Damned
In flames
Damned
In flames
Damned
In flames
