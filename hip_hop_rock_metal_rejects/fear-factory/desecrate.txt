Desecrate the vows within
Sanctify all your fears
Desecrate the holy church
Desecrate

Fill the abyss
With you hatred
Slaughter my child
Before your eyes
Fill the abyss
With you hatred
Slaughter my child

[Repeat 1st verse, 2nd verse]

Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Drink his blood like wine
Taste his body like bread
He's not my god
He's not my god
He's - Not - My - God

Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Drink his blood like wine
Taste his body like bread
He's not my god
He's not my god
He's - Not - My - God
He's - Not - My - God
He's - Not - My - God

Not my god! 
Desecrate! 
Not my god! 
Desecrate!
