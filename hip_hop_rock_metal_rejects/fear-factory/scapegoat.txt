Judges have decimated
Meanings of our laws
Already guilty
Something has a flaw
Wrongly accused
Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Try to realize

[Chorus:]
Don't you know
You can't see
Too damn blind
To judge me!

Wrongly accused
Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Try to realize

[Repeat Chorus]

Laws are meant to follow
But they've misled you
Conceal their meaning
So they can suit you
Misjudged by the system
No one ever knows
Adding injury to insult
No one ever knows
No one
No one knows
No one
No one
No one knows...

Judges have decimated
Meanings of our laws
Already guilty 
Something has a flaw
Wrongly accused
Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Wake up, realize! 

[Repeat Chorus, 3rd verse]

Scapegoat
Scapegoat
Scapegoat
Scape - Goat
Scape - Goat
