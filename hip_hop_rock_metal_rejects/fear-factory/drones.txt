You waste away
A spinning cage
Mass bided by the sun

You spend your day
Stuck in a race
And life has just begun

A paradise is in eclipse
And lives are lost
And for distress

The wage of sin is money spent
Your life a debt full of regret

We are lost in the maze
Falling
Falling...

And now your life
Amounts to nothing
A fortune has a price

Cause in the end
All humans die
A debt your in the hide

A paradise is in eclipse
And lives are lost
And for distress

The wage of sin is memory spent
Your life a debt full of regret

We are lost in the maze
Falling
Falling....

Falling away again...

Get! Up!

Lost in the maze
Falling
Falling...

Falling away again...
