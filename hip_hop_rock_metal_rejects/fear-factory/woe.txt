Caught beneath visions of hatred
Drowning fast in sounds of silence
Caught between divisions of hate
Can't breathe under this weight of existence

[Chorus:]
Too strong, 
Too strong for you
Too strong, 
Too strong for you

[Repeat 1st verse, Chorus]

Drowning
Drowning
Drowning
Drowning [X2]

[Repeat 1st verse, Chorus]
