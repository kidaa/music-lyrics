violence in my head
like a thorn that pierced my skin 
spilling strength on the floor where i stand
it surrounds me, controls me 
shows weakness inside me 

they've tried to kill me
but they won't succeed!

no one
no one
no one can deny 

sadness in my heart
like a storm that ripped apart 
all the fragments of what was happiness
it takes over, and numbs me 
shows the fear inside me 

they've tried to kill me 
but they won't succeed! 

no one
no one 
no one can deny 

take one more shot at me 
and believe! 

takes over and numbs me
shows the fear inside me! 
inside! 
inside my head!
