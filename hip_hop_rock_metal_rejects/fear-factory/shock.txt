Welcome to my world
Headfirst to the Earth
With my sights on the goddamned kill switch
I've become a fuse
Charged with attitude
Fixed and dialated by my anger
I have become a direct
I have become a current
I have become a direct
I have become insurgent
I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified, amplified
Shock to the system
Alternate to the wires
Heat my core desire
I will not stand for condemnation
I've become the volts
To lead the revolt
Fuck with me ensues danger
I have become a direct
I have become a current
I have become a direct
I have become insurgent
I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified, amplified
Shock to the system
I am the power surge
I am the insurgent
Electrified, amplified
Electrified, amplified
Shock!
