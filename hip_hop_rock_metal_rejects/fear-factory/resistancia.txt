Resistancia

They walk over you 
As if you weren't there 
Equality does not exist 
In our cold life since... 

Chorus:
They don't know who you are 
They don't care 
They don't see that we are 
Everywhere 

Nation under fire 
And they just sit back 
They don't seem to realise 
That we will fight back 

Repeat chorus 

Out of sight 
Out of mind 
Out of sight 
Out of mind 

They walk all over you. 

Look into their eyes. 
Make them see their foes. 
Be the individual 
To strike the fatal blow. 

Repeat chorus 

Out of sight. 
Out of mind. 
Out of sight. 
Out of mind. x3
