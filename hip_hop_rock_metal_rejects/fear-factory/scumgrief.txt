Cry, cry, cry, cry

Wires around your arms
Like wires around your head
A crucifix of me
Above your bed

I've seen your wounds
That you can't hide
You bleed well
When I cry

[Chorus:]
Cry, cry, cry
Scumgrief, Scumgrief
Scumgrief, Scumgrief

Smell the rats of deviance
Coursing through your veins
Rotting faith in yourself
Confined alone to decay
I've seen your wounds
That you can't hide
You bleed well
With the rats inside [X2]

[Repeat Chorus]
