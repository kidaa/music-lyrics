Invade and encompass to judge and dissect
Witness and persecute to serve and protect
To serve, and to protect to serve
To serve, and to protect to serve
Watchful and aware,  contrain every movement
Admit the consequences,  freedom's an illusion
Where is security governed through scrutiny
Your privacy denied,  organized and confined!
No place to hide!
No place to hide! 
There is no place to hide
Plugged in your mind
Conformed design
To concede your rights
Concede your mind
Surrender to authority
"All must abide and all must adhere"
Future opression becoming more clear
This is a warning so you must take heed
This coming vision is reality
Where is security governed through scrutiny
Your privacy denied,  organized and confined!
No place to hide
No place to hide...
