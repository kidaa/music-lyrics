consequences that had left me for dead
repercussions that went straight to your head
trusting in no one 
believing in nothing 
living in a world of pure deception

so far this life is contemptuous
this mind, a gun, so relentless 

damn! i am damaged for life!
damn! like i've been crucified!
damn! i am damaged for life 
and i can't believe i'm alive! 

determined to destroy all that you know 
conceal your lies in the web you compose 
trusting in no one 
believing in nothing 
living in a world of pure deception 

so far this life is contemptuous 
this mind, a gun, so relentless 

damn! i am damaged for life! 
damn! like i've been crucified!
damn! i am damaged for life damn!
and i can't believe i'm alive!
