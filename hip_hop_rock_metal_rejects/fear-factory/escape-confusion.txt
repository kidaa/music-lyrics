Escape, escape

Escape confusion
Escape animosity [X2]

From morality
A morbid animosity
Addicted to the epidemic
That deteriorates progression
Escape confusion
Escape animosity

Desperately washing away
The gore that's hidden beneath the dismay
Thoughts of eternal despair
And self hate
Escape confusion
Escape animosity

Terrorism within
Dreams become reality
Visions of hope
Attempt to escape
Attempt to escape
Attempt to escape the sickness! 

Terror
Dreams become reality
Visions of hope
Attempt to escape
Attempt to escape
Attempt to escape the sickness! 

[Repeat 1st verse]
