Hurt Conveyer 

All that you have 
And you really have nothing 
To show for the life that's your own 
Suddenly you realize 
That this world has no meaning 
And you're left alone 

I fall down into your own despair 
I was lost, now I'm found 
Now what do you want from me? 

I force my way inside your head 

Come to your senses 
And this will repent us 
And judge you for all that you are 
Comatose and you're oblivious 
To the confession that proved you a liar 

I fall down into your own despair 
I was lost, now I'm found 
Now what do you want from me? 

I force my way inside your head 
Not part of this world!
