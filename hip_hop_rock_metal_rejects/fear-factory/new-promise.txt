Understand that,
I will keep you safe from every scar that bleeds,
I will keep you free from all that's hurting me,
This i promise...
I promise,
One more time,
This i swear,
Trust in me,
My faith is sincere,
Love is stronger,
When the end is near,
Then there will be,
Nothing more to fear,
I promise,
Trust in these,
Love, life, hands,
You need me,
To help you stand,
I can release you,
From your pain, dear,
Then there will be,
nothing more to fear,
I promise...
Love is stronger,
When the end is near,
I can release you,
From your pain, dear,
Understand,
I promise...
