dark bodies floating in darkness
no sign of light ever given 
imprisoned in a world without a memory
unconscious, or am i conscious
cut from the heart i am part of 
sometimes i feel as though i'm frozen in heaven

and i saw my own face in the dark and lonliness 
and i saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven

in dreams i see myself flying
closer to the sun, and i'm climbing 
tried to touch the sun 
but the brightness burned my eyes
unconscious, or am i conscious
fell from the sky like a star 
sometimes i feel as though i'm frozen in heaven

and i saw my own face in the dark and lonliness 
and i saw my own face like a spark

dark 
my life was so dark... 
my mind was so dark... 
everything was dark 

unconscious, or am i conscious 
fell from the sky like a star 
sometimes i feel as though i'm frozen in heaven 

and i saw my own face in the dark and lonliness 
and i saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven 
dark bodies floating in darkness...
