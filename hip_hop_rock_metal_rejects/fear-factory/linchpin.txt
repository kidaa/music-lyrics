can't take me apart!

see the light, a new day has arrived for us 
genesis of our evolution 
a linchpin holds within a means to an end 
can't you see that we are one 

can't take me apart!
no you can't! 

we see no end to the dream 

we will never see the end
we will never be the end 
all my life i've felt discarded 
never feeling a part of it 

no you can't! 

without me you will fade, you will not remain 
we are one, and of the same future machine! 
a linchpin holds within a means to an end 
can't you see that we are one 

can't take me apart! 
no you can't! 

we see no end to the dream!

we will never see the end 
we will never be the end 
all my life i've felt discarded
never feeling a part of it 

no you can't take me apart 

you can't change me now
