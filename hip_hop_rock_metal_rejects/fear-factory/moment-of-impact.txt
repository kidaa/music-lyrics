Falling from the sky and I have lost all track of time
Every image of my life flashes before my eyes
Going to the precise time of my demise
My said prayers of circumstance have recently expired

I pray in spite
My soul my life

Straining every muscle for my contact with fate
I could never dream my life would end this way
Cross my heart and hope to die
Fade to the black
Brace myself the time is now the moment of impact

I pray in spite
My soul my life
My cross I pray
Will Hide In spite I pray
My cross In spite
My fears of impending doom that I'm about to die

Brace for PAUSE the shock
The trauma
Brace myself for the impact
Brace for PAUSE the shock
The trauma
Brace myself for the impact

I can hardly breathe
I can hardly breathe cause I am choking on this deadly scream

Brace for PAUSE the shock
The trauma
Brace myself for the impact.
