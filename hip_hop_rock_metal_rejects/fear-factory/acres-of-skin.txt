walk through the ashes of man
skin like fields on fire
pain is only a weakness 
death is just an escape 

we are connected like tissue 
feed on the shame you've raised 
why continue the harvest 
we are already dead 

no one can reap these scars we've sown

there is no morning sun
no falling rain
for acres of skin 

wait! can you hear the machines 
gears that cultivate flesh 
why continue the harvest 
we are already dead 

no one can reap these scars we've sown

there is no morning sun
no falling rain
for acres of skin 

all i want and wish for 
is to end this suffering 
all alone and unaware
all primed up for dying

without face, without mind 
without dreams, without memory
