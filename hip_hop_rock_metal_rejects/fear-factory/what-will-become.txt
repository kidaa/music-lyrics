we've cut in, cut out 
the face of man 
cut in, cut out 
the face of... 

time has given us no reason to live 
look to the future and you will see nothing 

what will become 
what will we be 
when we can see our own eternity 

we've lost hope, lost fate 
we've lost our way 
lost time, lost grace 
we search for... 

man has taken time from all that you see 
look in his eye, see the future hold nothing 

what will become 
what will we be 
when we can see our own eternity 

what will become 
what will we be 
when we can change our own eternity

man has taken time from all that you see
look in his eye and you still will not see
no! you will not see!
