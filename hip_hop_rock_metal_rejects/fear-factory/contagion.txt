A man held hostage, by this contagion
Alone abandoned, in search of legion
Under pressure, under black skies
We must find the cure, before we die
I can see the bullets rip, inside the crossfire,
My suicide run through, the razor wire

All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever

Terror awaits me, at every turn
Honour is stronger, we fight all at once
Hate spreads like wildfire in foreign lands
Incurable pain is this gun in my hand

All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever

Who wants to live
Who wants to live...forever

All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure for the mercy of one
All must endure for the mercy of one

Mercy of one
Mercy of one
Mercy of one
