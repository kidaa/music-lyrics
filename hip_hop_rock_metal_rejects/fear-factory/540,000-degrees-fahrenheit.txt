Witness a blinding light, Sudden bright light from a blast
Pulsing radiation moving through cracks under skin
Feel the fire in the wind
Deadly kiss of scorching sands

Not a prayer of hope or redemption in your eyes
Hell exploded on this earth to take all thats alive
Standing at the face of death
Terror stealing your last breath

Watch the firestorm incinerate you into ash!

All that you know burns away into dust
So many lives
So many inocent
Burn!

Every particle returns to its natural form
Ashes into ashes blown away just like the dust
Heaven burning with the sky
Hell is not the reason why

Feel the firestorm melting your spirit into glass!

All that you know burns away into dust
So many lives
So many innocent
Burn!

So many lives
So many innocent

All that you know burns away into dust
So many lives
So many innocent

So many lives
So many innocent
[repeat]

Burn!
[repeated until the end]
