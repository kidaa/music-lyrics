A paralyzed mind embracing decay,
Dead like carrion just wasting away,
There is nothing...
Numbed by excess and complete saturation,
Scarred influence by degeneration,
There is nothing to believe...
All has been lost,
All have lost their way,
Every eye has been disgraced,
Dead like carrion,
We must carry on...
There is nothing...
Lost innocence and blank revelations,
Searching for a hope in static transmissions,
There is nothing to believe...
All has been lost,
All have lost their way,
Every eye has been disgraced,
There's no reason,
There is no reason for empty vision
