Chosen to speak
Truth of the weak
Where is your god 
Truth has been lost

Where is the way 
Whose life will pay 
No one is wrong
Grief is too strong

Lose the way
Pain today
Who can say
Who will pay
No wisdom
No vision

All is lost
Pain is lost

[Repeat 2nd verse]

Lose the way
Pain today
Who can say
Who will pay
No wisdom
No vision

All is lost
Pain is lost
All is lost
Pain is lost [X2]
