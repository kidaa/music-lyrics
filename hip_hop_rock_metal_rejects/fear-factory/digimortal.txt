one step! 

as i witness the death of innocence 
a predator feeding on its creation
through the fallout of this hallucination
i walked into darkness 

must not surrender my god to anyone
or this body will become carrion 

one step closer 
one step closer to my fate 
one step closer 
one step closer to the grave 

as i witness my own degeneration 
the future condemns me 

must not surrender my god to anyone 
or this body will become carrion

one step closer 
one step closer to my fate 
one step closer 
one step closer to the grave 

one step closer...
