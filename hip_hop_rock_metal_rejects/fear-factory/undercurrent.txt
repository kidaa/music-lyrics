Lies are all that we hear
Death your undertones of fear
Lies are what causes fear
Death you and all that I hear

This in your eyes
So clear your eyes

Undercurrents
We cannot believe
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me

Face me
Look in my eye
Hate me
I see through your mind
Face me
You still cannot
Hate me
Drowning in lies

Your lies can't hide
So clear your mind

Undercurrents
We cannot believe
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me

Drown!

Haha!

Undercurrents
We cannot believe
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me

Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning me
Undercurrents
Slowly drowning
