In my eyes stagnation surrounds
Blood that life beaten and bound
An act of mercy, a scene pain
There is no difference
It's all in your name

This act of god

Lights of fate brighten my eyes
Fires of hate scourge through the sky
Lost in your darkness, burned by your flame
Forced to believe it's all in your name

This act of god

Honesty's heresy in this holy war
Contradiction and affliction hardening my heart
My heart..

Life conflicts with open decay
Death resticts enlightenment
Love is paradise hate is insane
There is no difference it's all in your name

This act of god

Honesty's heresy in this holy war
Contradiction and affliction hardening my heart
My heart..

This act of god
This act of god

Holy war
Holy war

Honesty's heresy in this holy war
Contradiction and affliction hardening my heart
My heart..
