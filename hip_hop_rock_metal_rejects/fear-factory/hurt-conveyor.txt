all that you have 
and you really have nothing 
to show for the life that's your own
suddenly you realize 
that this world has no meaning 
and you're left alone

i fall down into your own despair
i was lost, now i'm found
now what do you want from me 

i force my way inside your head

come to your senses 
and this will repent us 
and judge you for all that you are
comatose and you're oblivious 
to the confession that proved you a liar

i fall down into your own despair
i was lost, now i'm found
now what do you want from me

i force my way inside your head
not part of this world!
