Some men believe
Animals aren't seen
Testing on their minds
Testing with their lives
You can't believe
Not even percieve
Animals that die
Animals that cry

[Chorus:]
Crash test! So what! 
Crash test! So what! 

Catastrophies
To the animal species
Politically correct
On animals, to dissect 
What does it mean
When animals can dream 
Destroying a pure life
Only for a price

[Repeat Chorus]

Animals that die
Animals that cry
Testing on their minds
Testing with their lives [X2]

Crash! Test! 

Animals that die
Animals that cry
Testing on their minds
Testing with their lives

[Repeat 1st verse, Chorus]

Crash!
