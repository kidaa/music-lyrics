So much violence in our name
A life, a silence masked in shame

Children running in the streets
Soldier boots are on their feet
Mothers bare the burdens of our defeats
Fathers are on their knees praying for mercy

So much violence in our name
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
So much violence in our name
A life, a silence masked in shame

No more, no more, no more no more
No more, no more, no more no more
No more, no more, no more no more
No more, no more, no more no more

Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield
Holding me like your shield

No more violence in our name
No more violence in our name

No more, no more, no more
