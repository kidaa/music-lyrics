Fear me not but fear my hell
Man made me so I could kill
Praise me in the name of war
I destroy both rich and poor
I am the way, prepare for salvation
I am the way, prepare for salvation
Strength in time of suffering
Man alone is a weakling
Ascension is what you ask
I will be the fall of man
I am the way, prepare for salvation
I am the way, prepare for salvation
Salvation...
Those of you who dare to stray
I will tear your mind away
Those of you who dare to stray
I will take your life away
Salvation...
I am the way, prepare for salvation
I am the way, prepare for salvation
Salvation...
