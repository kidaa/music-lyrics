This lonely isolation,
Follows me through my dreams,
I wander around with doubt,
So cold and incomplete,
There is nothing here for comfort,
No spark of hope i see,
I breathe deep and fill my lungs,
To silently release...
This is more than a dream to me,
I breathe deep and drown my lungs,
And release silently,
I gasp for breath to only hear,
What's inside me,
An echo...
More than a dream to me,
An echo of my scream...
I gasp for breath only to hear,
An echo...
More than a dream to me,
An echo of my scream...
