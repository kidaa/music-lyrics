Nothing is the way it seems
Discerning man from machines now
Dominate as to erase
Wiping man off Earth's face now
Defaced by all inept justice
Shamed by the mental abuses
Branded "inferior weakness"
Ordered to cease and desist!
Man is obsolete!
Our world, obsolete!
Man is obsolete!
Erased,  extinct!
Obsolete! 
Fueling engines through deceit
To eradicate humanity
Defaced by all inept justice
Shamed by the mental abuses
Branded "inferior weakness"
Ordered to cease and desist!
Man is obsolete!
Our world, obsolete!
Man is obsolete!
Erased,  extinct!
Obsolete!
