i'm nothing more
nothing less 
than a single piece of flesh 
nothing more
nothing less 
than a worthless piece of flesh! 

no, i have not forgot 
what you said to me 
this is reality, cast me away!

i've lost my mind
lost my faith
the machine made me the slave 
lost my mind 
lost my faith the machine made me the slave!
worthless 

no, i have not forgot 
what you said to me 
this is reality

falling, fading... 
traces of my soul 

i have no more memory 
no more past that i can see 
devoid of that which defines me 
devoid of all humanity
don't know how i got here 
but i wish that i was dead!

no, i have not forgot
what you said to me
