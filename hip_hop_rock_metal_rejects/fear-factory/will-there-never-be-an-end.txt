Will There Never Be An End 

After the smoke clears 
And the pain subsides 

Will there never be an end? 

Lying on the pavement 
Looking at the sky 

Will there never be an end? 

Where is the finish line? 
Racing against time 

Will there never be an end? 

After the smoke clears 
And the pain subsides 

Will there never be an end? 
Will there never be an end? 
Will there never be an end? 
Will there never be an end? 

Will there never be an end?
