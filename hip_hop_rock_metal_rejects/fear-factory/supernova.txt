This ever changing world ever changing me
It feels new pathways for my soul to see
soul to see
It lights so bright, so bright in your eyes your eyes
Casting off the shadows that darken your mind

Shine it brighter than the sun blinding every eye I was
Fires burning inside me blinding lights for all to see
To shine brighter
To shine brighter

This storm will rage me to end before the dawn
This star is bright before the end is come
It lights so bright, so bright in your eyes
Casting off shadows that shrouded your spoken eyes

Shine it brighter than the sun blinding every eye I was
Fires burning inside me blinding lights for all to see
To shine brighter
To shine brighter

An ever changing world ever changing me
An ever changing world ever changing me
This ever changing world ever changing me
It feels new pathways for my soul to see
Eternally

Shine it brighter than the sun blinding every eye I was
Fires burning inside me blinding lights for all to see
To shine brighter than the sun
To shine brighter of what's to come
To shine brighter burning
To shine brighter burn
To shine brighter burning
To shine brighter burn
