Securitron [Police State 2000] 

Invade and encompass to judge and dissect 
Witness and persecute to serve and protect 
To serve, and protect to serve 
To serve, and protect to serve 

Watchful and aware, constrain every movement 
Admit the consequences, freedom's an illusion 

Where is security governed through scrutiny? 
Your privacy denied, organized and confined! 
No place to hide! 
No place to hide! 

There is no place to hide 
Plugged in your mind 
Conformed design 

To concede your rights 
Concede your mind 
Surrender to authority 

"All must abide and all must adhere" 
Future oppression becoming more clear 
This is a warning so you must take heed 
This coming vision is reality 

Where is security governed through scrutiny? 
Your privacy denied, organized and confined! 
No place to hide! 
No place to hide...
