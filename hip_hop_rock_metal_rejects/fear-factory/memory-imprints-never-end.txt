Memory Imprints Never End 

After the smoke clears  
And the flames subside  
We have been forsaken...  

A thousand eyes were upon me  
Soulless, and without mind  
We have been forsaken...  

Will there never be an end?  

If I could be forgiven  
Every breath would be a prayer  
We are not forgiven...  

Will there never be an end?  

I have tread, and spanned the horizon  
I've seen this world, the beauty in decay  
I strike down the faceless and unknown  
I feel blessed, for I can see  
The stars look down on me...  

Will there never be an end?  

As the stars look down on me...
