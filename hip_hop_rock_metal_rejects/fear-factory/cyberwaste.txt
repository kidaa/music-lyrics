Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
Fuck you

Spread your word this point of you
And connect the machine
Goddamned words, ocean of lies
Taunting you to decieve

Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of hate
Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
Fuck you

So you'll seize up in your lies you
Tell up at the site
Sees you, signals and hate me to stand
Me with your lies

You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of hate

Reap what you sow
Your words are shit

You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of hate

Assume that you know my thoughts
All I want to do is see
Infect me with your disease
Tapping only on the keys
Change your face in front of me
Safe behind the cyberscreen
Wishing that you knew the truth
All I know is what I read

Nothing you say matters to us
