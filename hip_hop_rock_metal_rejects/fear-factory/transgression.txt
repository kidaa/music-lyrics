One nation of gods, divided by faith,
A nation is divided by faith,
Witness deliberate war of attrition,
Judge me not, lest you be judged,
Eyes are blinded, blinded by violation,
I hate your contention,
I hate you violation,
I hate your corruption,
I hate your life destruction,
I am your enemy...
Witness deliberate war of attrition,
Kill my mind, my mind is the weapon,
Words are banned, these words meant to enlighten,
I hate your contention,
I hate your violation,
I hate your corruption,
I hate your life destruction,
I am your enemy,
I will resist,
Endlessly...
