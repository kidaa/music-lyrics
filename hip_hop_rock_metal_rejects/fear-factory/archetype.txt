You must never forget
The essence of your spark
All of that which defines you
Is the essence of your blood

The infection has been removed
The soul of this machine has improved [x2]

Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Someone real
This is real
What you wish to be

You must never forget
To modernize performance
Malignancies on the system
Will handicap slow up and rust

The infection has been removed
The soul of this machine has improved [x2]

Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Someone real
This is real
What you wish to be

Fuck!

Can you see
Can you see

Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Someone real
This is real
What you wish to be

Open your eyes open your eyes, open your eyes [x7]
