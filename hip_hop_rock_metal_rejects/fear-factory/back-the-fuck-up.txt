from the wasteland
cold steel under my wasteband
hazardous times
enemy lines drawn in the middle the streets 
the concrete's stained with blood
i still got to eat 

when i hit the street i made the man understand 
i fought with flesh and i bled like a man
i rode that edge of darkness my friend 
stood up to the enemy so life could begin 

you know you got to
back the fuck up 
back up off of me

traces of ignorance 
offense of hatred 
the faces change in the same old places 
dark nights and lost souls
collide to cross those 
the line between a death and dream 

i never wanted to lead your leash 
to pull around your ton of grief 
i'll come back with a fist of lead 
to educate your mind with a blow to your head 

you know you got to
back the fuck up 
back up off of me

don't let the time pass waitin' for the answer 
you are exposed to all of the danger! 

you know you got to 
back the fuck up 
back up off of me 

don't let the time pass waitin' for the answer
