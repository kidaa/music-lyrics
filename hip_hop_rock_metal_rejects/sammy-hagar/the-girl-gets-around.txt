Well, she'd like you to think she was born yesterday
With her innocent looks and her little town ways
When she's smiling at me, she's got angels in her eyes

But I've seen how she moves and the girl really cooks
And she taught me some tricks that you can't learn in books
And I'm starting to think there's a devil there inside

Well, I'm not just a boy who believes what he sees
But she's got a kiss, brings me down to my knees
Over and over, I never get my fill

And she might try to talk like she's pure as the snow
She blushes a lot, but she'll never say no
When her motor is running, this girl don't sit still

The girl gets around
She knows what she likes
I got what she needs
And one of these nights
We'll both make our moves
We'll cover some ground
The girl gets around
Good God, the girl gets around

Well, she holds me so tight and she whispers so sweet
But she knows all the names of the guys on the street
She broke hundreds of hearts, but I won't be that blind

The girl gets around
She knows what she likes
I got what she needs
And one of these nights
We'll both make our moves
We'll cover some ground
The girl gets around
Good God, the girl gets around
