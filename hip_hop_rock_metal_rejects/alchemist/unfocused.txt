All my thoughts are unfocused.
help me focus the distorted - my
conscious span is spun all my thoughts
unfocused - a collage of thoughts in my
mind help me focus the distorted -
conscious span is spun protruding
exertion of concentration - perception
corruption is my frustration unbearably
undecided - undefined and uttered.
