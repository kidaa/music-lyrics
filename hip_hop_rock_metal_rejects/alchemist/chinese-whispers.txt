9:32
Speaking my mind
Single trail of thought
Difference in the way we perceive
Your ability to receive
I know you listen, faults lie between us.
You hear my speaking, something changes my words.
Chorus
Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts.
Your interpretation of my actions, convenient to your cause.
I'll say again another way.
Splintered slithers of truth, rumored tales, my proof.
Tolerance prevents and outcome.
Repeat Chorus
Words a mouldable form of matter, 
interpretation, your point is shattered,
lies a manifestation of truth
changes arise because of a difference,
Words a mouldable form of matter,
interpretation, your point is shattered,
lies a manifestation of truth
Don't accuse me because of a difference
I know you hear my words,
But somehow there's faults that lie between us.
Speaking my mind
Single trail of thought
I know you're listening
But some faults lie between us,
I know you hear my words.
Repeat Chorus
