3:38
The commands of an ancient sultan
whispers through the sandstorm wind of time.
Calling across the centuries
A lost ghost city of the mind.
Far beyond the valley of the kings,
lies buried deep within the sand.
A city of decadence ? and greed,
that's why the gods condemned the land,
Furthest reaches
recorded time, lay
Ubar city of lust and greed
reading the chiselled inscriptions.
A funerery temple.
Osrisis tributes to the gods
The sultan of ?
Denied the ? of this land
Decipher the heiroglyphics
City overcome by lust
Ancient ?
Angered by the king of sin
Let the holocaust begin
This was the city of Ubar
Watch our modern life return
to ancient ways.
We're on the road to Ubar
