The past is open,
but the future still hides.
Natural selection,
the strongest will survive.
Planatery process of
eveloutionary change.
Natures chosen aspects from
hereditary range.
Repeat twice
Perspectives of truth,
Artificial selection,
Rather than supernatural intervention
Could life possibly be 
as simple as your revelation
because we have evolved
there is no myth of creation.
We may have been created
But not from two single beings
Eternal genetic process of mutating genes.
Random shuffle
Random mutation
