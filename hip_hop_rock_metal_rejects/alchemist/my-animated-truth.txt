I exist yet still exist intoxicated with the
senses of life an awareness, an example
in this world I am god picture mind's eye
to stimualte the nuclei I am the god of
the inner world, all I see and comprehend
is mine visions taken in remain sublime,
overcrowded ethics overwhelm -
Welcome to my animated truth.
Picture of a world of imagination,
physical world is just interpretation.
Reconstruct myself. Dreamscape.
Imagine images of your imagination.
