Clot - by my own closed mind poisoned
images self imagination - sense of
reckoning haluts its gestation attitude
and feelings unable to relate the iron
barrier my subconscious creates
- clot, CLOT, CLOT, microelectric
memories solitarily confined preventing
new additions to the archives of my
mind confrontation of my lobes to bridge
the gap where knowledge flows knowing
what I thought is hidden from me -
confrontation of my lobes to bridge the
stream where knowledge flows
