I can't hold this day
Anymore
Understand me
Anymore

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done

Ooh this uncertainty, is taking me over

I can't mould this stage
Anymore
Recognise me
Anymore

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done

Ooh this uncertainty, is taking me over
is taking me over

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done

Ooh this uncertainty, is taking me over
is taking me over
is taking me over
