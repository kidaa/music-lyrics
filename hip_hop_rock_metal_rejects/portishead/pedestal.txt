How can I believe this miracle
Where the wind blows dry
Thru the force of a man
Undenied by his eye

You abandoned me
How I suffer
Ridicule breathes a sigh
You abandoned me
Lost forever
Hush, can you hear.....

Enter and rejoice this pedestal
Where the rainbows hide
Your destiny
Mystery of all time

No time make or reason
Ridicule breathes a sigh
No time make or reason
Hush, hear him cry.... 

[INSTRUMENTAL]

No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason
