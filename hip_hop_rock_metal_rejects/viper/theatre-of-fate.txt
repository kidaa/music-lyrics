The crowd came to silence
The spotlights are shining
A tale has to be told

In any age
All the world is a stage
A play will now begin

There once was a child
With a dream in his mind
And a thousand things to learn

But with each passing day
His childhood sleeps away
How soon the first act ends

All the dreams that we have
Are lost along the way
Victims of real life

Now the child is a boy
And new dreams have evolved
He strives to make them real

Not the fear in his heart
Nor a past full of pain
Will take away his hope

But how cruel life is
And although he resists
New problems will appear

So he'll loose one more chance
Time destroys all his plans
The second act is done

All the dreams that we have
Are lost along the way
Victims of real life

We are looking
For the meaning of our lives
But our faults remain the same

And the truth
Will be distant from our hearts
Where our dreams will never endBut our fate is in command

Now the boy is a man
Though his visions remain
He knows they have no chance

A heart full of hate
All his hope driven away
Life's worn down his defence

How many lives
In the world born and die
In disillusionment

Not allowed to have dreams
And one day make'em real
This tale will never end

All the dreams that we have
Are lost along the way
Victims of real life

We are looking
For the meaning of our lives
But our faults remain the same

And the truth
Will be distant from our hearts
Where our dreams will never...

We are looking
For the meaning of our lives
But our faults remain the same

And the truth
Will be distant from our hearts
Where our dreams will never end

But our fate is in command
But our fate is in command
But our fate is in command
