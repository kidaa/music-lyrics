Sunday
I'm never in the mood to find a place
Where I can get a bit of inspiration
It's also hard to be awake

I never meant to be too hard
But I can never be nice on sundays

If I can give you more and more
Tell me if you're here 'cause I'm not sure
Or leave me while I sleep

When you're feeling down you're feeling down
You turn the radio and never find your sound
You know I'm not ready to get upLonely
I'm waiting for the night to come
To walk away from people calling me for something
That I don't care anyway

You say that I should have more friends
But why
I live as all my days were sundays

If I can give you more and more
Tell me if you're here 'cause I'm not sure
Or leave me while I sleep

When you're feeling down you're feeling down
You turn the radio and never find your sound
You know I'm not ready to get up
