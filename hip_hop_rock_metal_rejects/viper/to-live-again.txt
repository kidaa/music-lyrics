Prowling through the city
Destination nowhere
Passing through the windows
Of a million lives

Drowning in depression
Looking for some action
An answer to the pain
Of my last thousand nights

If I had a way
To make some moments come back
So true and real
I will spend my life in memories
Of the past

But nobody lives in dreams
And nobody really cares
If I'm really fuckin' tired
Of this fuckin' life

So I head into a bar
And I drown all my emotions
Forget the disillusionment
I have inside

If I had a way
To make changes in the pages of
My past
Feelings are to share
Everybody needs somebody it's a factWrong choice but
C'est la vie
I'm waiting for the dawn
To live again
The lonely shades of my days

Prowling through the city
Destination nowhere
Passing through the windows
Of a million lives

Drowning in depression
Looking for some action
An answer to the pain
Of my last thousand nights

If I had a way
To make changes in the pages of
My past
Feelings are to share
Everybody needs somebody it's a fact

Wrong choice but
C'est la vie
I'm waiting for the dawn
To live again
The lonely shades of my days
