Lifestorm broke my anchors
Like a wreck I've been
Sea and sky were just one darkness
Such a brilliant radiance you came

I'm alive, I'm alive
Just by the light
From your eyes

And I need you to be
Like the heaven I seek
But clouds showed me
And I saw

You were just the moonlight
And the moon belongs to
No one, no one,..
