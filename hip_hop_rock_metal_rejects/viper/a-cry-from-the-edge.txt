Six AM and I'm still awake
Living thoughts and words of yesterday
But I'm too tired to think what is right
And I'm alone, I can't decide on my own

Take me beyond the lies
All the time you can stay by my side
And if you show me
A little and everyday
Then you'll know that I can find my way
All you hear now
Is a cry from the edge

Hey my friends! You've got to bring me back
We all begun and now you hide the fact
Illusions fly for those that understand
Memories that keep me tied to my pastTake me beyond the lies
All the time you can stay by my side
And if you show me
A little and everyday
Then you'll know that I can find my way
All you hear now
Is a cry from the edge

Painful mystery to be alive
Scary visions of my future life
Time for change give me a better way
Free me from the shadows over my eyes

Take me beyond the lies
All the time you can stay by my side
And if you show me
A little and everyday
Then you'll know that I can find my way
All you hear now
Is a cry from the edge
