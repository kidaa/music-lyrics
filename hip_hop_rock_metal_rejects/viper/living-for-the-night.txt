Between dusk and day
Before the sunrise
The city will begin to live its crimes

Millions if you ask
It happens everywhere
Every little corner has its tale

Windows are the eyes
That witness without soul
Watching in the silence what is done

I'm a part of this
Violence is my friend
Walking on the line of life and death

Spirits walk the streets
Siren sounds alone
Screaming out the lyrics of my song

I have no other life
Concrete is my cage
All my desillusions turns to rage

I'm living for the night
Though we have to fear it
Where life is just a game
That you have to win

Living for the night
When death surrounds you on and on
All the time it's near
I'm longing to be free

He even knows my name
He wants no waste of time
I know that killing is his game
And I am the prize

Our footsteps sound alone
I know he's just behind
I feel the panic in our hearts
Beating very loudI turn my eyes to him
The night is very dark
He's got a knife and I know
Cause I saw the blade

Between the light and shade
Between the night and day
Between my life and death
I only feel the blade

Between dusk and day
Before the sunrise
The city will begin to live its crimes

Millions if you ask
It happens everywhere
Every little corner has its tale

Windows are the eyes
That witness without soul
Watching in the silence what is done

I'm living for the night
Though we have to fear it
Where life is just a game
That you have to win

Living for the night
When death surrounds you on and on
All the time it's near

Living for the night
Though we have to fear it
Where life is just a game
That you have to win

Living for the night
When death surrounds you on and on
All the time it's near
