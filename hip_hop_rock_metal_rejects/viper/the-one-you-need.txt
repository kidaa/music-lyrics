So many nights
I look inside
And I saw the light
Of your cold eyes on me

So I spend all day
I couldn't lay
I shouldn't stay
Like that so easily
Down on my knees
Like this

My dream is now so far away
I'm not livin anymore

I'll be around you all the time
'Till you realise that I'm the one you needScreaming loud
No time to walk
Or voice to talk
I'm just through memories

Feeling like a slave
Wishing my grave
Such an easy way
To get me out of here
Stepping near
More tears

My dream is now so far away
I'm not livin anymore

I'll be around you all the time
'Till you realise that I'm the one you need
