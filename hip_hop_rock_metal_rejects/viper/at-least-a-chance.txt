Four billion faces
Are searching for their dreams
Fighting for a better way
Despite how hard it seems

Oh! Do you remember
Those words from long ago
That inspired us to progress
To make our future grow

Life goes on
It's brutal lessons
We must accept
Even through the tears

Maybe someday
A hopeful light
Will lead all the people
To live better lives

It will be
Like childhood dreams
Like cries in the silence
But I'll have at least a chanceStreet filled with tears
Are the picture of my life
I've got someone to forget
Somethings that I can't hide

The rain is so cold
It cuts me like the past
And the scar deep inside of me
How long will they last?

Life goes on
It's brutal lessons
We must accept
Even through the tears

Maybe someday
A hopeful light
Will lead all the people
To live better lives

It will be
Like childhood dreams
Like cries in the silence
But I'll have at least a chance
