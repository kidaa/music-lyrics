I'm a bad man bad man.

I'm a bad man, giving bad men... bad looks,

Prince amongst thieves and crooks.

Want bad women, bad cars, bad hoods, bad duels,

I'm making my own rules.

I'm a bad man, giving bad men... bad looks,

Prince amongst thieves and crooks.

Want bad women, bad cars, bad hoods, bad duels,

Making my own rules.

I'm a bad man.

Go to sleep now. Could wake up in trouble.

I'm a bad man, bad men, bad looks.

A prince amongst thieves, murderers and crooks.

Juvenile from a good kid.

What above a felony, and wake from a life bid.

If I was born blind, being daddy's hustling child,

Damn, I was born to be wild.

Ain't nobody gonna stop me.

I want it all 'til God shuts my eyes and they bury my body.

It's almost over, run. I'm talking to you. Y'all don't want nothing with me.

All day, all night, front of the store, my daddy's format.

Tustle on this corner, hustle on this corner.

Killers ran in his house, tied his spouse,

Cocked the hammer back, in a little boy mouth.

Been f***ed up ever since, Scar Murderer

Brought me and bust me, a gun ever since

Roam the streets, no love the streets

The streets changed me.

I'm a bad man, giving bad men... bad looks,

Prince amongst thieves and crooks.

Want bad women, bad cars, bad hoods, bad duels,

I'm making my own rules.

I'm a bad man, giving bad men... bad looks,

Prince amongst thieves and crooks.

Want bad women, bad cars, bad hoods, bad duels,

Making my own rules.

I'm a bad man.

You don't want to follow me.

Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.

Spit it all out, spit it all out, you hollar.

I'm a bad, bad, bad, man.

Watch out.

I'm a bad, bad man.

Fight Dirty.

Go to sleep now.

I like this part.

You know where to find me.
