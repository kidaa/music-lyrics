tainted
has our love grown cold
in a place that's bitter and broken
we tasted of a world I know
surely there must be something better
something forever
hello
from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
as the road is slowly turning
I know that in letting go
I'm learning how to live
through a life I have to give
walking
past the city lights
silence can be so disturbing
you'll find me standing in the night
the stars never seemed so unending
so unending
hello
from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
as the road is slowly turning
I know that in letting go
I'm learning how to live
through a life I have to give
we painted whitewashed everything
when all that remains are shadows of the stains
tell me where did we go wrong
can we just move on
hello
from the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
as the road is slowly turning
I know that in letting go
I'm learning how to live
through a life I have to give
yeah hello
to the world below
I'm watching the world spinning
this night seems so unending
well I follow to a place I know
that's only the beginning
start over after ending
