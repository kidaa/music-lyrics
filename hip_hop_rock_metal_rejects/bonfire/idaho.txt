My friends they wash the windows they shine in the sun
They tell me wake up early in the morning sometimes see what a beautiful job we've done
I said, 'let's put on some tunes, sing along, Doolittle all day'
Go down to the riverside take off our shoes and wash these sins away

The river said, 'la la la shame on you'
River said, 'la la la' it said 'shame on you'

I go down to Chicano City Park cause it makes me feel so fine
And when the weeds go down you can see up close in the dead of the wintertime
But when the summer comes everything's in bloom and you wouldn't know it's there
And the white folks like to pretend it's not but they're music's in the air

You can hear 'em singing la la la shame on you
And you can feel 'em dancing la la la shame on you

My friend Tanner she says, 'y'know me and Jesus we're of the same heart
The only thing that keeps us distant is that I keep fuckin' up'
Come on down to Chicano City Park and wash your blues away
And when the beautiful ladies walk right by y'know I never know what to say to them

And they say ooooh la la la la la la la la la shame on you
And they'll be dancing la la la they say shame on you
Shame on you

Let's go roadblock tripping in the middle of the night up in Gainesville town
There'll be blue lights flashing down the long dirt road when they ask me to step out
They say, 'we're looking for illegal immigrants can we check your car?'
I said, 'it's funny I think we were on the same boat back in 1694'

And I said ooooh la la la la la la la la shame on you
and they'll be dancing la la la they say shame on you
And I said ooooh la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la i said shame on you
And I said, I said, shame on you
They'll be dancing la la la they said shame on you
Shame on you

Roadblock trippin' in the middle of the night in Gainesville town
Blue lights flashing down the long dirt road
