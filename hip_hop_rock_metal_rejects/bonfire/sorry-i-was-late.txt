Don't turn your back
Danger surrounds you
Don't turn your back
To the dogs who hound you
Don't turn your back
Don't show your profile
You'll never know
When it's your turn to go

Don't turn your back
On intuition
Don't turn your back
On superstition
Don't turn your back
To your jealous neighbor
He just might blow
And spoil the show

Don't turn your back
One chance to save her
Don't turn your back
Keep her out of danger
Don't turn your back
She'll return the favor
She wants you so
Don't say no.

Things are not always what they seem
She will always say what she means
You'll never know who your friends really are
You'll use that special option in your car.

Don't turn your back
Danger surrounds you
Don't turn your back
To the dogs who hound you
Don't turn your back
Don't show your profile
You'll never know
When it's your turn to go
