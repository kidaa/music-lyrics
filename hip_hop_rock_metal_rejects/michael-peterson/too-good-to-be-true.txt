Michael Peterson/Gene Pistilli
You were all she ever wanted, that was once upon a time
She was all you ever needed, that's what makes it such a crime
How you took her heart for granted, how you threw her love away
Now you still don't understand it, if you did, you'd never say
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you
Just because she never said so, doesn't mean she didn't see
Every time you stole an apple off somebody else's tree
Late last night that lipstick letter she left on the bedroom door
Said ";You don't get it, and you ain't gonna get it anymore!"; 
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you
Here we go!
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you
Oh just too good to be true to you
