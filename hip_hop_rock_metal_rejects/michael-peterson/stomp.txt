Every Friday night you will find me here
Watchin'' people dancin' in a line
While I'm talking to this long neck beer
Throw me out there on the floor
I'll show 'em all a thing or two
Both my feet are left
Don't know the fancy steps
Cause here's a little dance that anyone can do
Kick off your workin' boots
Kick on that big back beat
Don't need to do much more
Just let the music move your feet
In time, to the rhythm rock steady 
Everybody's getting ready to romp
Ain't nothing'' to it
Now all you gotta do is just
STOMP
Do it loose or do it tight
Do it if it takes all night
Just put both feet on the ground
Pick 'em up and slam 'em down
Even if you do it wrong
You're doin'' it right
Kick off your workin' boots
Kick on that big back beat
Don't need to do much more
Just let the music move your feet
In time, to the rhythm rock steady 
Everybody's getting ready to romp
Ain't nothing'' to it
Now all you gotta do is just
STOMP
Kick off your workin' boots
Kick on that big back beat
Don't need to do much more
Just let the music move your feet
In time, to the rhythm rock steady 
Everybody's getting ready to romp
Ain't nothing'' to it
Now all you gotta do is just
STOMP
Kick off your workin' boots
Kick on that big back beat
Don't need to do much more
Just let the music move your feet
In time, to the rhythm rock steady 
Everybody's getting ready to romp
Ain't nothing'' to it
Now all you gotta do is just
STOMP
