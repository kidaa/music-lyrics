Craig Wiseman/Tim Nichols
Well a whole lot of people like Saturday night
Gettin' loud and crazy, well it just feels right
I guess everybody loves to see it come
Just forget everything and go and have some fun
And the same for me, oh but lately
Don't you know that lately
There's somethin' bout a Sunday mornin' breeze
Church bells ringin', ";bringin' in the sheaves";
And the smell of supper, simmerin' on the stove
A little bit of both's sure good for the soul
Sittin' on the swing with her head on my chest
Givin' any worries one day's rest
Suddenly everything's gonna be okay
There's somethin' 'bout a Sunday
Now that big bad Monday is bound to come
That ol' alarm clock's ringin' and we up and run
There's a whole lotta headaches that we get into
Everybody's wonderin' how to make it through
Well the same goes for me, oh but lately
Don't you know that lately, yeah...
There's somethin' bout a Sunday mornin' breeze
Church bells ringin', ";bringin' in the sheaves";
And the smell of supper, simmerin' on the stove
A little bit of both's sure good for the soul
Sittin' on the swing with her head on my chest
Givin' any worries one day's rest
Suddenly everything's gonna be okay
There's somethin' 'bout a Sunday
Sittin' on the swing with her head on my chest
Givin' any worries one day's rest
Suddenly everything's gonna be okay
There's somethin' 'bout a Sunday
There's somethin' 'bout a Sunday
