How did we get here?
How did we find our way?
How did we know which road to take?
What did we do right?
Was it just in the stars?
Maybe that's why some lovers survive
And others just fall apart
We're two of the lucky ones
Heaven sure smiled on us
There've always been a chosen few
Who win and love and those who lose
Baby me and you, we're two of the lucky ones
When I look around
There's sadness in so many eyes
Then I look at you and all we've been through
That's when I realize
We're two of the lucky ones
Heaven sure smiled on us
There've always been a chosen few
Who win and love and those who lose
Baby me and you, we're two of the lucky ones
Call it fate, call it destiny
Nothing can destroy a love that's truly meant to be
We're two of the lucky ones
Heaven sure smiled on us
There've always been a chosen few
Who win and love and those who lose
Baby me and you, we're two of the lucky ones
