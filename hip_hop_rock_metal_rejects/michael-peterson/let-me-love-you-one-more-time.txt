Michael Peterson/John Bettis
I've been holdin' you for hours.. wish I had a couple hundred more
Maybe then I'd find the words to say what happens
When I put my lips to yours
I could try and write a legendary love song
But there's never been a rhyme to show you how I'm feeling...
So let me love you one more time
It's like a hundred prayin' angels when you're whisperin' my name
The way you reach me in the darkness
Makes me want you like candle wants the flame
As I hold your tender body and surrender everything
I know that I'm never gonna leave you...
So let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Drink your kiss like it was wine
Cause when I hold your heart like mine
We can leave this world behind
There's the first light of tomorrow on the wall above the bed
Is it real what I remember
Or just embers of a dream inside my head?
As I'm thinkin' that it didn't really happen
And feeling it's a crime
You smile at me and tell me...
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Drink your kiss like it was wine
Cause when I hold your heart like mine
We can leave this world behind
So let me love you one more time
