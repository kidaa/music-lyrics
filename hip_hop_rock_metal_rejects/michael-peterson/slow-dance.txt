Michael Peterson/Robert Ellis Overall
Do you remember our first dance together?
I prayed for a slow song, it felt like forever
Then I made my move
You smiled as I reached for you
I had this feeling that you would be my girl
And as the band played ";Welcome To My World";
We both had to laugh at the song fate had chose for..
You and me
Cause every word fit so perfectly
And every feeling we felt is still true
Life is a slow dance with you
Each moment without you is one moment too long
Cause every love song that I hear is our song
Who would have believed after all this time it's still..
You and me
Cause every word fit so perfectly
And every feeling we felt is still true
Life is a slow dance with you
Oh, it's just me and you
Together we're right where we're meant to be
And I'm sure that I'll say
When my time is through
Thanks for the slow dance
With you
Oh, with you
