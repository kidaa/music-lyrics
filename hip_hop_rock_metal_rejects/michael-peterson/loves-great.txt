Michael Peterson/Arlos Smith
Everybody's wavin' good-bye to Joe
His wife called, last call...he's gotta go
Kinda brings a tear, to every single guy
I admire his dedication, he's a family man
Thirteen years had a ring on his hand
Kinda makes me wonder, if I should give it a try
Well I would if I could, but I can't so I won't
They're sayin' I do, I'm sayin' I don't
I won't regret it, one single minute
'Cause love's great when you're not in it
No curtains on the windows, just a couple sheets
TV dinners, my life is complete
Ain't no one more committed...I love the single life
If I want to, I can put on my cleanest dirty shirt
Stay out all night for better or worse
Just look what I'd be missin', if I had a wife
Well I would if I could, but I can't so I won't
They're sayin' I do, I'm sayin' I don't
I won't regret it, one single minute
'Cause love's great when you're not in it
Well I would if I could, but I can't so I won't
They're sayin' I do, I'm sayin' I don't
I won't regret it, one single minute
'Cause love's great when you're not in it
I would if I could, but I can't so I won't
They're sayin' I do, I'm sayin' I don't
I won't regret it, one single minute
'Cause love's great when you're not in it
