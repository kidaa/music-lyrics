Tonight as I lay close to you
You whispered in my ear, just how much you love me
I wiped away your tears
After you were fast asleep
I looked out at the stars
And counted one for every single blessing that you are 
I want you to know
I need you to see
The wonder and the miracle that you are to me
My love is as endless as the stars in the sky
I wanted you to see it too
Before another day goes by
As I closed the window
A star fell from the sky
I kissed you on the shoulder
You opened up your eyes
You'll hear what's in my heart
Before this moment fades away
I'll take you in my arms, pull you close to me, and say
I want you to know
I need you to see
The wonder and the miracle that you are to me
Starting tonight, I made up my mind
You'll know how much I love you
Before another day goes by
I want you to know
I need you to see
The wonder and the miracle that you are to me
Starting tonight, I made up my mind
You'll know how much I love you
Before another day goes by
You'll know my love for you is true
Before another day goes by
