Sure feels real good sittin' with you way up here
When you whisper in my ear.. sure feels real good
Sure feels so right stayin' with you all night long
Ain't no way to get it wrong.. sure feels so right
It happened for a reason
It happened by design
It happens every time you put your tender lips to mine
Ain't sayin' that you shouldn't
Ain't sayin' that you should
But it'd sure feel real good... if you would
Sure is easy when your head is on my chest
I can figure out the rest.. sure is easy
It happened for a reason
It happened by design
It happens every time you put your tender lips to mine
Ain't sayin' that you shouldn't
Ain't sayin' that you should
But it'd sure feel real good... if you would
Don't need to buy me presents
Don't need to spend a dime
The sweetest thing that you could ever give me is your time
Ain't sayin' that shouldn't 
Ain't sayin' that you should
But it's sure feel real good.. if you would
It'd sure feel real good.. if you would
