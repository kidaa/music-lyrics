Michael Peterson/Ashe Underwood
If you had asked me, I'd have told you
There ain't nothin' I don't know
Like no matter how I hurt her, I just knew she'd never go
Up until the day she left me, I'd have sworn I'd never crawl
Well it's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all
Figured she'd be much too frightened, to make it on her own
So I was sure that she'd come cryin'
After just one night alone
I kept waitin' by the telephone, so certain she would call
It's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all
I never knew a broken heart
Could turn you inside out
I didn't know, that I didn't know
What love was all about
If she came walking through the front door
There's a million things I say
Like ";I love you"; and ";I missed you, please don't ever go away.";
And if you would just forgive me
I'll be at your beck and call
'Cause it's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all
It's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all
