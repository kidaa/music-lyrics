Waitin' for the wind to blow
Waitin' for the earth to shake
Holdin' out for the one true love
Afraid of makin' a mistake
With a mistaken notion
That a river of emotion's gonna
Sweep you off your feet 
Hopin' someone else can make your life complete
Just remember..
It ain't what you get, it's what you give
Not where you look, but how you live
Not if you take a chance, but how you take it
You find love when you make it... oh oh!
You find love when you make it... yeah!
Somebody's out there tonight
Tryin' to find you somehow
Holdin' out for the one true love
Do you get the picture now?
You'll understand it
When it happens, wild abandon's gonna...
Sweep you off your feet
The love you give away will make your life complete
Just remember..
It ain't what you get, it's what you give
Now where you look, but how you live
Not if you take a chance, but how you take it
You'll find love when you make it... oh oh!
You'll find love when you make it... yeah!
If everybody's tryin' to find the right one
Go ahead and be the right one
And love will find you
And when it does, it's gonna...
Sweep you off your feet
The love you give away will make your life complete
Just remember..
It ain't what you get, it's what you give
Now where you look, but how you live
Not if you take a chance, but how you take it
You'll find love when you make it... oh oh!
You'll find love when you make it... yeah!
