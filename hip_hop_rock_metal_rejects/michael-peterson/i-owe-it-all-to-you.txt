Look how far we've girl I owe it all to you
The first time I had seconds thoughts
About loving you I almost walked away
I'm glad I stayed
I know you love me like nobody does
So now I'm certain that if stayin' was a mistake...
It was the best one I ever made
Seemed I was always just a few footsteps behind
But still you knew
If you were patient that in time my heart
Would find it's way to you
Look how far we've come girl it's all because
You would not give up on me
If I stop to count all my blessing out 
I know what they would be
Your forgiveness, devotion, our love and an ocean
Of little things you do
Yeah I've got it all and I owe it all to you
If ever there was someone I could trust
Beyond a shadow of a doubt it must be you
Girl your love is true
If life ever brings us to a standstill girl
We'll catch love's second wind
And let it blow our hearts away
To places we have never been
Look how far we've come girl it's all because
You would not give up on me
If I stop to count all my blessing out 
I know what they would be
Your forgiveness, devotion, our love and an ocean
Of little things you do
Yeah I've got it all and I owe it all to you
