Michael Peterson/Josh Leo/Robert Ellis Orrall
Made it through Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday
Made it through Friday night
Work week drove me out of my mind
Now it's outta sight
Got til Sunday to things our way
Heres how its going to be
I'll follow you out on that floor
If you'll follow me
We're gong to get lost in the shufle
It's going to be an all night, hold tight, feels right now kinda shuffle
An invitation to dance on the double
Forget about your troubles baby
Let's get lost in the shuffle
Gonna take my chances on a little line dance
Baby put your hand on mine
Oh, let me sweep you off your feet
Leave your blues behind
Everytime you swing me, girl you know it brings me
Two steps closer to love
Oh, you just tell me what to do, I'll show you how it's done
We're gong to get lost in the shufle
It's going to be an all night, hold tight, feels right now kinda shuffle
An invitation to dance on the double
Forget about your troubles baby
Let's get lost in the shuffle
Mama says she loves shortnin' bread
Baby loves being with me instead
Mama wants baby back home in bed
Lets forget about what Mama said
We're gong to get lost in the shufle
It's going to be an all night, hold tight, feels right now kinda shuffle
An invitation to dance on the double
Forget about your troubles baby
Let's get lost in the shuffle
Forget about your troubles baby
Lets get lost in the shuffle
