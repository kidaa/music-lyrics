Michael Peterson/Paula Carpenter
I was 12 when daddy said to me
Don't take to drinking boy that road don't lead no where   
And don't you ever let me hear you swear 
Don't you dare
He told me that stealing's a lazy man's way
Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it 
and then you can look the whole world in the eye
Honey I've tried
But Since I met you girl I've been breaking every rule
I must confess I'm just a back sliding fool
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
Last night I threw away the 12 step book
I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you
There's nothing more that I can do  Ain't no use
Cause every time I see your angel face
My halo disappears without a trace  I swear
Girl I'd admit I haven't got a prayer
But I don't care
I know this ain't exactly how I was raised
But heaven help me honey I ain't changing my ways
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie
Drink, swear, steal and lie
