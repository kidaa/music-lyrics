It's Monday 8am, traffic jam
But you and I have got a better plan
Forget the daily grind, dollar signs
Stress and life or death, deadlines
Let's live like millionaires today
Laughin' all the way...
To the bank of the river on the outskirts of town
With a fishin' pole in the water hole and throw a blanket down
Get a bucket of Kentucky fried, put twenty in the tank
Blow the dust off of that bottle of wine we never drank
There's never been a better day to be 
Laughin' all the way to the bank
We're gonna live it up, the two of us
Feet in the mud and our heads in the clouds
Live like the wealthy crowd, fast and loud
Any rich man would be proud
To share this poor man's holiday
Laughin' all the way...
To the bank of the river on the outskirts of town
With a fishin' pole in the water hole and throw a blanket down
Get a bucket of Kentucky fried, put twenty in the tank
Blow the dust off of that bottle of wine we never drank
There's never been a better day to be
Who says time off doesn't pay
Laughin' all the way to the bank
