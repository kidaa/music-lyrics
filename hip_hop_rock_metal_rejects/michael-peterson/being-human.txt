Jenny's got a nose ring and tattoo on her skin
All her friends are doin' it and she wants to fit in
It's not about rebellion, she just has a need
To feel like she belongs
Her mama takes one look at her and flies into a rage
Says, ";When you gonna grow up child and learn to act your age?";
But when a young girl's cry for attention
Lies beyond her mama's comprehension, it's just
Human beings being human
Not sure what they're doing
Trying to do the best they can
Just human beings being human
Every woman, child, and man
Harry's turning 49, his hair is turning gray
Now he's acting like he's longing for his glory days
He buys a Harley, dyes his hair, he's lifting weights
And wearing new cologne
His wife of 20 years is worried where it's gonne lead
Will he turn to someone else to fill his every need?
Lately she's afraid he's gonna leave her
But he's just doing all he can to keep her, it's just...
Human beings being human
Not sure what they're doing
Trying to do the best they can
Just human beings being human
Every woman, child, and man
Sometimes we doubt, sometimes we fear
Often wonder why we're here
Where do we fit in the plan
We're all bound to make mistakes
And when we do
It helps to understand it's just...
Human beings being human
Not sure what they're doing
Trying to do the best they can
Just human beings being human
Every woman, child, and man
Human beings being human
Not sure what they're doing
Trying to do the best they can
Just human beings being human
Every woman, child, and man
