Michael Peterson/Robert Ellis Orrall
I slowly turned the pages
and see all these smiling faces
it's hard to believe it was today, ten years ago
here is the invitation, to our wedding celebration
just look at the promise theses pictures shownow I know
If I had loved her by the book
She would be right here by my side but fool that I am
I overlooked my promise to love her forever, for worse or for better
We'd still be together...if I had loved her by the book
If I'd opened the book more often
Then I wouldn't forgotten
How much she cared, and how much I meant my solemn vow
To honor, to have and to hold her...but as I read them over
I know its to late to say I'm sorry now, but some how
If I had loved her by the book
She would be right here by my side but fool that I am
I overlooked my promise to love her forever, for worse or for better
We'd still be together...if I had loved her by the book
If I'd opened the book more often
Then I wouldn't forgotten
How much she cared, and how much I meant my solemn vow
To honor, to have and to hold her...but as I read them over
I know its to late to say I'm sorry now, but some how
If I had loved her by the book
She would be right here by my side but fool that I am
I overlooked my promise to love her forever, for worse or for better
We'd still be together...if I had loved her by the book
If I'd opened the book more often
Then I wouldn't forgotten
How much she cared, and how much I meant my solemn vow
To honor, to have and to hold her...but as I read them over
I know its to late to say I'm sorry now, but some how
If I had loved her by the book
