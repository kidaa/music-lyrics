Michael Peterson/Michael Puryear
Lately evolution theory
Is hitting home a lot more clearly
As our love slowly dies each day
You say this love ain't worth reviving
There's no chance of us surviving
We're doomed to simply fade away
That's what they said about the buffalo
The timber wolf and the eagle too
They made a comeback and I know
So could me and you
Let's get off of love's endangered list
We've got something that this world would miss
I know you're sayin' that there's no hope
That's what they said about the buffalo
We put in too many long nights
Working late and chasing the wildlife
Living like two hard headed fools
It's really not too big a mystery
The reason we are almost history
The talk all over town says we are through
That's what they said about the buffalo
The timber wolf and the eagle too
They made a comeback and I know
So could me and you
Let's get off of love's endangered list
We've got something that this world would miss
I know you're sayin' that there's no hope
That's what they said about the buffalo
I know you're sayin' that there's no hope
That's what they said about the buffalo
