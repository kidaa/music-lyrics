There's a party in my honor, at my house tonight
A few of my ol' drinking buddies will be droppin' by
They'll come to celebrate my graduation
After eight long years, of higher education
So here's to me
I finally passed the bar
As I drove by that ol' honky tonk
Still tuggin at my heart
I never dreamed that neon night school
Would ever be so hard
I can't believe at last
I finally passed the bar
I've got an awful lot of memories, that I can't recall
But I know from those old stories
I must have had a ball
With the money that I spent on my tuition
What would you do hoss
Well I could retire and spend the rest of my life fishin'
Oh well
Here's to me
I finally passed the bar
As I drove by that ol' honky tonk
Still tuggin at my heart
I never dreamed that neon night school
Would ever be so hard
I can't believe at last
I finally passed the bar
I was first in my class
To the bottom of a glass
But it was killin' me
I used to get loaded
But now I've been voted
Most likely to succeed
Here's to me
I finally passed the bar
As I drove by that ol' honky tonk
Still tuggin at my heart
I never dreamed that neon night school
Would ever be so hard
I can't believe at last
I finally passed the bar
I can't believe at last
I finally passed the bar
