Well there's a rusty ol tin roof overhead
Keeps out the rain at night
A lazy ol dog layin' under the truck
And he's been known to bite
There's a 12 gauge shotgun over the door
So darlin' don't be surprised
If we end up starin' down a double barrel
When we pull up the drive 'cause
Mama 'n them have always lived
Way back up in the hills
Nothin's ever changed 'em
Lord nothin' ever will
If they don't shoot us first they'll ask us in
And treat you just like long lost kin
Honey you're gonna fit right in
With Mama 'n them
Better honk the horn just to let 'em know
They don't get much company
And they won't believe this big Cadillac
Really belongs to me
If you ain't sure yet just what to expect
From my side of the family
Well you better duck to know it's us
I can't make no guarantees 'cause
Mama 'n them have always lived
Way back up in the hills
Nothin's ever changed 'em
Lord nothin' ever will
If they don't shoot us first they'll ask us in
And treat you just like long lost kin
Honey you're gonna fit right in
With Mama 'n them
