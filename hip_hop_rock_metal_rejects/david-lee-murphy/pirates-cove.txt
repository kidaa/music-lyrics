The lake at night is still and black
The water's smooth like polished glass
You've heard the tales so it's time to go
Gonna take you back into pirates cove
Got a sure ol' horse Evinrude
And a 12 foot jon boat to carry the brew
A couple of steaks and a big ol' knife
My old ghost is comin' back to life
You could say I know the way by heart
Through the stumps and in the dark
There's one way in and that's by boat
That'll get you back into pirates cove
A trail of smoke curls though the trees
Fire down low and there ain't no breeze
Just the cottonmouths and the copperheads
And for some strange reason I fit in
You could say I know the way by heart
Through the stumps and in the dark
There's one way in and that's by boat
That'll get you back into pirates cove
Well it's a different world when you get back here
The dancin' shadows disappear
The memories they'll come and go
Someday I'll stay in pirates cove
You could say I know the way by heart
Through the stumps and in the dark
There's one way in and that's by boat
That'll get you back into pirates cove
You could say I know the way by heart
Through the stumps and in the dark
There's one way in and that's by boat
That'll get you back into pirates cove
