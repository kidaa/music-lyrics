Well they took me home in the back of a checker cab
After somebody took a chair cross the back of my head
My mama said bring him on in
And when they told her where I'd been she said
Why can't people just get along
Well mama never said a word as she patched my head
I figured she wasn't happy with me gettin' her out of bed
I said mama I hope you ain't mad
She said come on we're going back hey
Why can't people just get along
Why can't people just get along
What a world it would be
If we could all just have fun
'Cause it don't do nobody right
When it comes down to a fight hey
Why can't people just get along
Now when I got trouble ain't no one I'd rather have
Than my mama next to me with a broken bottle in her hand
She went in swingin' and when she got through
Everybody saw her point of view she said
Why can't people just get along
Why can't people just get along
What a world it would be
If we could all just have fun
'Cause it don't do nobody right
When it comes down to a fight hey
Why can't people just get along
Well now things don't always run smooth in a honky tonk
And some nights somebody's gonna rub somebody wrong
And in those isolated incidents
We all loose our common sense hey
Why can't people just get along
Why can't people just get along
What a world it would be
If we could all just have fun
'Cause it don't do nobody right
When it comes down to a fight hey
Why can't people just get along
