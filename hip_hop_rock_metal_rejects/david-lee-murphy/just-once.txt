David Lee Murphy/Kim Tribble
A man can't look at a woman too long
Who looks like you without having thoughts
Run through his head and straight past his heart
Well I might not stand a ghost of a chance
You're a one man woman not a one night stand
You're not the kind to let it go that far
But I wouldn't think twice
If you ever changed your mind
Just once what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once I'd love to know what it's like
Just once before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice
Gazing into your big brown eyes
Tonight I'm a little bit hypnotized
What makes a man put himself thru this
I can't count the times I've held my breath
As you walked past to control myself
I think it's time to get it off my chest
So what I'd like to say
If I had my way
Just once what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once I'd love to know what it's like
Just once before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice
If you changed your mind
Well I wouldn't think twice
Just once what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once I'd love to know what it's like
Just once before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice
