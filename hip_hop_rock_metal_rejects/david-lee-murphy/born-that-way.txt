David Lee Murphy/Jimbeau Hinson
Came out swingin' and a kickin' with my heels dug in
Puttin' up a fight like they ain't seen since
The doctor held me up looked me in the face
Said he didn't have to slap me but he did it anyway
I don't know why
Just born that way
No I don't know why
Just born that way
No I never had nothin' and I know I never will
All my daddy left me was a funeral bill
If something's too easy something's wrong I know
'Cause I was born the gift of a hard way to go
I don't know why
Just born that way
No I don't know why
Just born that way
You know all in all it ain't such a bad lot
You learn to live with what little you got
Never had a job that didn't stink
Never really cared what anybody thinks
I don't know why
Just born that way
No I don't know why
Just born that way
