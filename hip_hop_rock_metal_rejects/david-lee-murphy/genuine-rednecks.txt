David Lee Murphy
Well I know my place and I'm not ashamed to say it
No darlin' it even makes me proud
If there's one place I know where I'm never alone
It's where I feel most at home
It's in a room full of real live genuine rednecks
Bonafide backwood misfits
Goodtimin' hillbilly lunatics
With cold beer and jukebox music
I don't like crowds but this one's mine
'Cause everybody here is genuine redneck
Well darlin' right or wrong where I do belong
It don't come with a crystal chandelier
I'd have to go out on a limb to say I fit in
With all the social high class atmosphere
Why we could slip out the back door and find my pickup truck
Darlin' I'm just wishin' I was in the middle of
A room full of real live genuine rednecks
Bonafide backwood misfits
Goodtimin' hillbilly lunatics
With cold beer and jukebox music
I don't like crowds but this one's mine
'Cause everybody here is genuine redneck
Now there may be those who look down their nose
At the company I keep
Oh but just to let you know as good people go
If you don't like them you won't like me
You might find the front door propped open wide
But you'll know you've been somewhere been inside
A room full of real live genuine rednecks
Bonafide backwood misfits
Goodtimin' hillbilly lunatics
With cold beer and jukebox music
I don't like crowds but this one's mine
'Cause everybody here is genuine redneck
Good time bonafide real live genuine full blooded redneck
