Lookin' at the bare spot on the bedroom wall
Brought home the honest truth to me
The picture hangin' there was just another treasure
I had lost so foolishly
It took all this to realize the talks we had
Meant she was tired of playin'
And now I see she needed more
Of what I wasn't doin' or sayin' 
So just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To show her just how much she really means
Just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To give the kind of love a lady needs
Promises don't push aside 
The fact that I had taken her for granted
Just a touch to let her know how much I really cared
Was all she wanted
But it's too late to change her mind
When you're just a memory behind her
So take her in your arms and make her see
She's the one you'll want forever 
So just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To show her just how much she really means
Just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To give the kind of love a lady needs
Hold her
And she'll be satisfied
She needs
Lovin' all the time
So just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To show her just how much she really means
Just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To give the kind of love a lady needs
So just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To show her just how much she really means
Just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
To give the kind of love a lady needs
So just don't wait around 'til she's leavin'
