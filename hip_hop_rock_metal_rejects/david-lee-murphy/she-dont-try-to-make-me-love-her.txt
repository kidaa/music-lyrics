She called me up last evenin'
She said come on by
When I got there she was leavin'
And I was right on time
She said I'm sorry hon' but I can't stay
I've had a change of plans
When I get home it might be late
I hope you'll understand
She don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
No she don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
I'm always bringin' her flowers
And she don't say a word
I tell her how I feel about her
It's like she never heard
I get the feelin' she avoiding me
Oh but just the same
If she ever started spoilin'me
It wouldn't change a thing
She don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
No she don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
She don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
No she don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
