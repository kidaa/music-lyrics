Well I can feel those wheels start turin' 'round honey
When ya walk into the room
The rest of the world fades right off into the blue
Yeah I'm off of the ground up in the clouds
Not sure which one I'm on
And I couldn't tell you what day it is baby
Not when your in my arms 'cause honey
I forget about everything every time I get around you
Girl it's like I got a one track mind all I wanna do
Is stare into those big brown eyes
It's almost like I'm hypnotized
Every time every time I get around you
You'd think by now I'd learned somehow
To keep under control
But girl you're the kind that makes man just wanna let go
I don't care about nothin' but your sweet lovin'
When you look at me that way
And sometimes when I'm holdin' you tight
I can't remember my name 'cause honey
I forget about everything every time I get around you
Girl it's like I got a one track mind all I wanna do
Is stare into those big brown eyes
It's almost like I'm hypnotized
Every time every time I get around you
I forget about everything every time I get around you
Girl it's like I got a one track mind all I wanna do
Is stare into those big brown eyes
It's almost like I'm hypnotized
Every time every time I get around you
