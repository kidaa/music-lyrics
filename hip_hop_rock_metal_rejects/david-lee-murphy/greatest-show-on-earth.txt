I've watched her close her eyes
When she kissed me
And I've heard her moan so low
And I've felt her hold me tight
With all her soul inside
In ways a woman only knows
You won't see one like her
In this whole world
She's given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didn't love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth
Lookin' back I can't believe
I couldn't see she needed me
But like a fool I let it end
And it should have been so clear
When I wiped away those tears
There's just some things you can't pretend
You won't see one like her
In this whole world
She's given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didn't love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth
Maybe I just saved myself
The pain and all the heartache
Of bein' just another face in the crowd
She made it look so real Lord
It came to her so easy
It's one thing that I'll never doubt
You won't see one like her
In this whole world
She's given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didn't love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth
