David Lee Murphy
Said goodbye in Tennessee
I dried her tears and I ran free
Had the whole wide world to see
But that's behind me
Took a while 'til I found
Her sweet love I couldn't live without
Now every time I turn around
That's behind me
Yeah that's behind me
When I close the door
And try to face another night alone
It taps me on the shoulder
Just about the time my eyes begin too close
That's behind me
From the pages of my past
That ole ghost keeps, coming back
No matter where I run no matter how fast
That's behind me
Look for love and see her face
Another town another place
Though I'm a thousand miles away
That's behind me
Yeah that's behind me
When I close the door
And try to face another night alone
It taps me on the shoulder
Just about the time my eyes begin too close
That's behind me
Yeah that's behind me
When I close the door
And try to face another night alone
It taps me on the shoulder
Just about the time my eyes begin too close
That's behind me
