David Lee Murphy/Buddy Cannon
You give to me
A kiss and a whisper
My love is all you'll ever want
And I've told myself
I shouldn't listen
'Cause some words are said and then they're gone
And those velvet lies
On your lips tonight
Would be so easy to believe in
And I know this time
That my hands are tied
With those velvet lies
So soft and warm
Well I can't help thinking
It could always be like this
But I know the truth
Is somewhere waiting
And you know I can't resist
And those velvet lies
On your lips tonight
Would be so easy to believe in
And I know this time
That my hands are tied
With those velvet lies
And those velvet lies
On your lips tonight
Would be so easy to believe in
And I know this time
That my hands are tied
With those velvet lies
