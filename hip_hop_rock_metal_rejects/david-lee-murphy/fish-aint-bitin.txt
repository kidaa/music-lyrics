Sally Cantrell worked behind the bar
Had a wavin' rebel flag tattooed on her arm
She called everybody honey
That came walkin' through her door
She was known for puttin' things just the way they were
She called 'em like she saw 'em without smoothin' fur
When it comes to woman torubles
Nobody said it better than her no sir
If the fish ain't bitin'
If the fish ain't bitin'
Well now don't go gettin' shook
Honey take a look
What kinda bait you got on the hook
With that low smokey voice I can she her Lord
Breakin' up fights over Chevys and Fords
With that motherly broomstick logic
No man can ignore
But on the subject of love she gave good advice
And everybody listened without thinkin' twice
And she swore when she said it
Without blinkin' an eye oh my
If the fish ain't bitin'
If the fish ain't bitin'
Well now don't go gettin' shook
Honey take a look
What kinda bait you got on the hook
So if you're down on your luck and all you can say is
You should've seen the one I let get away
Well maybe all you need is a change in your strategy yes indeed
If the fish ain't bitin'
If the fish ain't bitin'
Well now don't go gettin' shook
Honey take a look
What kinda bait you got on the hook
