When I saw you comin' honey 
I could tell 
Life's really been treatin' you well 
There's a change 
A burnin'bright 
I'm seeing you in a different light 
'Cause you're 
All lit up in love 
Like the lights of heaven above 
I've never seen you look so good 
All lit up in love 
You never told me honey 
I was blind 
You never said I'd wake up and find 
That somebody'd come and 
Take my place 
But it's written all over your face 
'Cause you're 
All lit up in love 
Like the lights of heaven above 
I've never seen you look so good 
All lit up in love 
Wish I'd been the one to put that sparkle in your eyes 
To see that glow about you girl,it's a look I recognize 
'Cause you're 
All lit up in love 
Like the lights of heaven above 
I've never seen you look so good 
All lit up in love 
'Cause you're 
All lit up in love 
Like the lights of heaven above 
I've never seen you look so good 
All lit up in love
