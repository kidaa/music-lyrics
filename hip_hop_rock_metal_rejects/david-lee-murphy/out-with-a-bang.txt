David Lee Murphy/Kim Tribble
I just dropped five dollars in a juke box baby
Ain't a soul on the old dance floor
If you're gonna run with the big dogs hon
You gotta get off the porch
You can sit there all night uptight honey
But a good time's something I know
You gotta get the jump while the night is young
And there's just one way to go
Out with a bang kickin' up dust
Honey tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain
Honey tonight I'm hurricane
Out with a bang
You know some folks say I'll never see Heaven
If I don't change the road I'm on
But me I know just where I'm goin'
I don't have to be told
The say livin' fast just won't last
But that don't bother me
'Cause when it comes my time to go
I won't go easily
Out with a bang kickin' up dust
Honey tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain
Honey tonight I'm hurricane
Out with a bang
Everybody wants good time
We all have the time
So if you're comin' with me now darlin'
You better hold on tight
Out with a bang kickin' up dust
Honey tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain
Honey tonight I'm hurricane
Out with a bang
