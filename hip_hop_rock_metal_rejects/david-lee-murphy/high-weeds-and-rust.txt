There's a shutter hangin' from a window pane
The paint's 'a crackin' from the sun and the rain
I just quit carin' 'cause I'm all alone
My woman left me in a broken home with
High weeds and rust
Up around my truck
With a broken heart
In an inch of dust
Well I've seen it all
Boom turn to bust
And I'm bout to drown
In high weeds and rust
Well there's a tractor sittin' in an empty field
I swore I wouldn't do nothin' 'til my heart had healed
My friends say son get her off your mind
But when the bank comes lookin' for me all they'll find is
High weeds and rust
Up around my truck
With a broken heart
In an inch of dust
Well I've seen it all
Boom turn to bust
And I'm bout to drown
In high weeds and rust
Well black birds sittin' on the telephone line
Watchin' me layin' around wastin' time
Never thought I could sink so low
I can't believe I just let it go to
High weeds and rust
Up around my truck
With a broken heart
In an inch of dust
Well I've seen it all
Boom turn to bust
And I'm bout to drown
