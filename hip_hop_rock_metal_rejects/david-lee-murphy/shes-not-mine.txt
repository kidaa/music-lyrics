I try to remember when we walk in the room
And she takes my hand
That crowds gonna stir
When they take one look at her
And be thinkin I'm a lucky man
And it could be so easy for me to believe
Cause I know there's nobody else
When I look in those eyes
And I see her smile
I've gotta keep telling myself
She's not mine
Lord knows I wish she was
She's not mine and 
I'm not the lucky one
Wish I could say
That she was my baby
But she's not mine
Now I understand that a woman like that
Is never easy to keep
Oh there ain't no question
She's no man's possession
Unless she wants to be
So think what you want when she's on my arm
Cause it sure is rough on me
No matter how good feels
Or how it appears to
She don't belong to me
She's not mine
Lord knows I wish she was
She's not mine and
I'm not the lucky one
Wish I could say
That she was my baby
But she's not mine
In my dreams I know the way it feels
But Lord I can't forget it's not real
She's not mine
She's not mine
Lord knows I wish she was
She's not mine and
I'm not the lucky one
Wish I could say
That she was my baby
But she's not mine
