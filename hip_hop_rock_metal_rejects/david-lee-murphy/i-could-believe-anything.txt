David Lee Murphy
A little white house
On the edge of town
A shady front porch
A few acres of ground
A big brass bed
Big enough for two
Where every night
I'm dreamin' 'bout you
Maybe it's the truth
Maybe it's my imagination
All I know is what my heart's sayin'
About me and you
That you're one in a lifetime honey
Like nothin' I've ever seen
And when I'm lookin' into your eyes 
I could believe anything
Never back up
Never turn round
I was never the kind
For settlin' down
And when I'm in your arms
It's where I wanna be
That little voice
Starts talkin' to me
Maybe it's the truth
Maybe it's my imagination
All I know is what my heart's sayin
About me and you
That you're one in a lifetime honey
Like nothin' I've ever seen
And when I'm lookin' into your eyes 
I could believe anything
Maybe it's the truth
Maybe it's my imagination
All I know is what my heart's sayin'
About me and you
That you're one in a lifetime honey
Like nothin' I've ever seen
And when I'm lookin' into your eyes
I could believe anything
