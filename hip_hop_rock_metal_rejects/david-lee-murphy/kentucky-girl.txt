David Lee Murphy
Underneath the big blue moon
Everything looks lonely
Even that sweet smile upon your face
Leavin' past tobacco rows
Down that ole dirt road
Can't remember when I felt this way
What did you do
Kentucky girl
You got me wantin' more
Than I wanted to
What did you do
Kentucky girl
I knew we'd have to say goodbye
And here we are together
Takin' one last look before I go
When I saw those big brown eyes
My heart said forever
Never heard it talk like this before
What did you do
Kentucky girl
You got me wantin' more
Than I wanted to
What did you do
Kentucky girl
Well if I go away
And leave you behind
When I come back someday
Would you still be mine
What did you do
Kentucky girl
You got me wantin' more
Than I wanted to
What did you do
Kentucky girl
