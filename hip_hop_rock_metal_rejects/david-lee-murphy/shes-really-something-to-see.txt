David Lee Murphy
She sat on the front porch and pulled on her boots
In her favorite old faded blue jeans
And one tail waggin' puppy climbed up into her arms
And I could tell he felt just like me
No matter where she goes he's never too far behind
When she steps out into that morning light
She really something to see
My dream comes alive
When I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees
She's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's
Really something to see
I've seen her in moonlight on soft summer nights
With ten thousand stars in the sky
And in a room full of candles like an angel in white
While the heavens rumbled outside
No matter where she goes I'm never too far behind
When she steps out into that morning light
She really something to see
My dream comes alive
When I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees
She's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's
Really something to see
It's like that movie you've seen time after time
Where you always find something you've missed
Well I could sit here right now and just watch her for hours
'Cause I know my world has been blessed
She really something to see
My dream comes alive
When I open my eyes
And I still go weak in the knees
She's too good to believe
And I can tell you that she's
Really something to see
