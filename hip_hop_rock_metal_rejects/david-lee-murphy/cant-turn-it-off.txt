David Lee Murphy
On a lonesome highway it was gettin' late
Not another set of headlights on the interstate
I was miles from nowhere my only friend around
Was a country station fadin' in and out
And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off
I was feelin' kinda desperate as the sun came up
They played ";Hello Darlin'"; and it was breakin' up
The signal on that lighted dial was barely comin' through
And I knew in a few more miles it'd be gone for good
And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off
Be a long ol lonely ride without it
When I can't hear enough
Oh I just turn it up
And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off
