I remember the night my dad stopped the car
And got out in the rain
Changed a blown out tire on a car
For a family with out of state plates
I said dad did we know those folks
As they waved and drove out of sight
He just smiled as he started the car
He said son not 'til tonight
You see the road you leave behind you
Is another road you're gonna have to come back down
It's just the way this big old world turns 'round
You'll find somehow somewhere someplace sometime
You gotta go back down the road you leave behind
Stuck out on the highway one night
Many years gone by
Had the hood of my truck pulled up
My ol' gas tank was dry
Some ol' guy gettin' off on the night shift
Pulled up to check on me
He said I been in your shoes before son
And it's no place to be
You see the road you leave behind you
Is another road you're gonna have to come back down
It's just the way this big old world turns 'round
You'll find somehow somewhere someplace sometime
You gotta go back down the road you leave behind
I said what do I owe you friend you could easily passed me by
He said next time it might be me son you don't owe me a dime
You see the road you leave behind you
Is another road you're gonna have to come back down
It's just the way this big old world turns 'round
You'll find somehow somewhere someplace sometime
You gotta go back down the road you leave behind
