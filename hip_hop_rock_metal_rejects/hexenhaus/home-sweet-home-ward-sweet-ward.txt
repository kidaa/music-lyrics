Light of reality please shine on me
Like an obscure poem my conscience returned
Strange thought echoes Inflicts my mind
I hear them come, it is time to sleep
The needle, the pain
The icecold nothingness
Medication
Intoxication
Home sweet home
Ward sweet ward
Awake again, gazing at shadows
Talking to myself, rhymes of lunacy
That I have never heard before
Voices, images occupies my senses
The men in white are back again
It is time
Medication
Intoxication
Home sweet home
Ward sweet ward
Why am I here, locked in this cell
Wrapped with wool
A mind deranged,
A psychopath they said
Fed with lies, you will never ever know the truth
Trapped in this cell
My passage to hell
To rot or to fade away
Seduction of madness
Kissed my mind
Their drugs keep the dreams away obey
My wills no more
I am here to stay I found my home
The needle doesn't hurt so bad
Anaesthetic for my soul
Medication
Intoxication
Home sweet home
Ward sweet ward
Home sweet home
Ward sweet ward
Home sweet home
Ward sweet ward
Home sweet home
Medication
Intoxication
