Standing out in bold relief
Against the mass of grey
Shadows linger on within the soul
Deathly pale, disguised in black
So eager for the fray
Searching for nirvana within so
RISE BABYLON
RISE WITHIN ME
RISE BABYLON
RISE WITHIN ME
Rise...
Rise now
On the threshold of pain
Sunday in my sad blue eyes
The worst for wear outside the pale
Wipe away those bitter tears now
RISE BABYLON
RISE WITHIN ME
RISE BABYLON
RISE WITHIN ME
RISE BABYLON
RISE WITHIN ME
RISE BABYLON
RISE WITHIN ME
Now, rise now...
Lead me through this darkened world,
Light a candle in m y heart
Take me far away from here
Where everything depends on you
Light a candle in my heart
Let the Saviours take me home
Take me far away from here
Where everything depends on you
Lead me through this darkened world
This wasteland of sorrow
Light a candle in my heart
Let love shine tomorrow
Let the Saviuors redeem me
Just take me home I'm feeling blue
Take me far away from here
Where everything depends on you
Just take me home, away from here
Take me far away, away from here
Le the Saviours redeem me
Light a candle within my heart
Let love shine
...Tomorrow
