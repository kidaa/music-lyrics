[Lead : Mike]
Across the crimson wasteland beyond our mortal lives
Goes a never ending traffic to the burning paradise
Among these crowds of lost souls misguided spirits thrive
All happiness and fortune they deeply despise
Tollington place - Built on the dark tunnels heart
Tollington place - Ist shelters were torn apart
Blameless a man invents the names
Writing it down for the girl to see
Blameless he plays the games which releases evil yet unseen
No protection left experience to pain
Life beyond death a paradise of pain
[Lead : Marco]
Abandon to die by the almighty god
Owned by the other side - A living book of blood
Through the opened cracks unconsiderable thin
Gushed voracious demons and carved in his skin
Cries filled up the air as they wrote on his body
Every inch of his flesh was covered by the story
Tollington place - Built on the dark tunnels heart
Tollington place - Ist shelters were torn apart
Blackness overflowed his head
Raven black evil from the deepest depth
Blackness mastered by the dead
Dragging his soul to the court of death
No protection left experience the pain
Life beyond death a paradise of pain
No protection left experience the pain
Life beyond death a paradise of pain
