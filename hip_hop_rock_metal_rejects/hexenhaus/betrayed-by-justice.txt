[Lead : Marco]
Enslaved to fear under lock and key
Forced to live on what's like borrowed time
A prisoner of innocence sentenced to death,
Condemned to die by the human hand
Where injustness reigns
Awaiting the execution
The hour of dying is creeping up to me
It's just a dream, a bad dream, it's just a nightmare
The wishes spin round and round within and twisting my mind
I'll relinquish life
Innocent in uncertainly
Of who is properly guilty
No turning back from beyond
A journey to infinity
Lead : Marco & Mike
Cold sweat at night
Pierce the marrow
A diabolic agony
A suffocation of the law
Prayers in vain
Echoes in the dark
Betrayed by justice
I don't wanna die
Innocent in uncertainly
Of who is properly guilty
No turning back from beyond
A journey to infinity
I don't wanna die ...
