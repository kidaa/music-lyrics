Caught within a vicious circle
Approaching the limits of pain
Falling into the pit where death is calling
Still roaming my mind
Haunted by distorted visions
Memories echoes from the past
Crying myself to sleep, fells like I'm dying
The nightmare won't rest
Trapped in the eternal nightmare for evermore
Torchured and beaten when pictures return from the war
No deliverance from the evil to come
Hell is paved with good intentions
A knowledge revealed from nightmares
Sleeping against my will the flesh is creeping
A fate worse than death
[Lead : Marco]
Trapped in the eternal nightmare for evermore
Torchured and beaten when pictures return from the war
No deliverance from the evil to come
Reflections of deeds I've done
Inflicts my sense at night
A sub-consciousness
Totally filled up with madness
[Lead : Mike]
Dreams won't fade away
Forever destined to remain
