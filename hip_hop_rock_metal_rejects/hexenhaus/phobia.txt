Incomprehensible
It's inexpressable
So indiscribable
It's inconceivable
Too inadmissible
And it's inalterable
Starin down the barrel of a gun
No more whistling in the dark
Am i the only one?
This is the end of fear
NAUSEA, INSOMNIA
HAUNTED BY THIE PHOBIA
Ineradicable
It's invariable
So inexplicable
It's inescapable
Too insupportable
And it's intangible
So there's more to life than meets the eye
More than flesh and blood can stand
I suffer and I sigh
This is the end of fear
NAUSEA, INSOMNIA
HAUNTED BY THIE PHOBIA
A constant fear of contaminations
A perpetual anxiety about virulent infections
Incommensurable
It's indefeasible
So inevitable
It's insuppressible
Too inapplicable
And it's incurable
A lethal terror, so psychological
A schizophrenic phobia
Brought into strong relief
This is the end of fear
NAUSEA, INSOMNIA
HAUNTED BY THIE PHOBIA
NAUSEA, INSOMNIA
HAUNTED BY THIE PHOBIA
