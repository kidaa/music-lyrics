Now,
I am reborn,
I have returned from the other side.
Now,
Like a new dawn,
I am reborn at the back of beyond.
I AM BACK FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
I am reborn at the back of beyond
I HAVE RISEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I am reborn
So,
Now I am free.
You ought to know ill weeds grow apace
So,
Time is the key.
I'm but a shadow of my former self.
I AM BACK FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
I am reborn at the back of beyond
I HAVE RISEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I am reborn I AM REBORN
I AM REBORN
No
Longer the grave.
To give the devil his due, I'm free.
No
Longer a slave
My former self pales by comparision.
I AM BACK FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
I am reborn at the back of beyond
I HAVE RISEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I am reborn
I AM BACK FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
I am reborn at the back of beyond
I HAVE RISEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE
I am reborn, I am...
