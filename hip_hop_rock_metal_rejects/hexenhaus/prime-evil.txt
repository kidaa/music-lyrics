I am the omen from deep within
I am the tempter the all seeing eye
The unborn force of destructive thoughts
The roots of evil
The essence of your hate
Awoken in me has the roots of prime evil
Awoken in me has the roots of prime evil
Awoken in me has the roots of prime evil
Awoken in me has the roots of prime evil
I am the wastrel the soul of man
The sinister in your ways
A creation of evil wants to break free
The threshold starts to fade
Now you are caught in my web
I am the captor forever to be
Your miserable life means nothing to me
Because evil will forever be free
Just by looking in my eyes
You will know the truth
I have always possessed your soul
You and I are the same
We are one, we are one
We are one, we are one
We are one, we are one
We are one, we are one
