A baby, blue eyed
Innocent and pure
Lullabies and fairytales
In a world, obscure
Seen from the cradle
So simple it must seen
Easy come, easy go
Just like a wishful dream

Unemployed and sick and tired
Of whistling down the wind
A situation
Self inflicted, yet self contained
And the needle temptes
Knowing life has gone down the drain
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
Hangin' on to hope, enslaved
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
Living a lie, just like a slave
Life has made me realize, it's lost
Then as a old man
When death is closing in
Looking back
All I'll see is misery and sin
Trapped in this wheelchair
Shivering with fear
Deeds of dementia
The grave is all too near
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
Lived my life just like a slave
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
Misery until the ende
