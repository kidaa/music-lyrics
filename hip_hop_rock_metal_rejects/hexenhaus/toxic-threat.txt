Department of hate, the hounds of war
A reign of terror within concrete walls
Mass psychosis, a mental decay
Department of truth that sells only lies
Toxic threat
A wayward thought could mean the end
Erased from time, you never were
Guilty as charged, lack of conviction
Extinction complete, of body and mind
Toxic threat, toxic threat
Immaculate extermination
Plans of corruption
Lies fed the masses
A public satisfaction
Termination guaranteed
Toxic threat, toxic threat
Toxic threat, toxic threat
