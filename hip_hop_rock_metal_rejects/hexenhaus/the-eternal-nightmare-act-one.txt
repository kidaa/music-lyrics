I will be waiting for you
I am your nightmare come true
Roaming your mind with endless fear
Your soul is mine to keep, mine to keep
Shadows descending it will begin
Into the eternal nightmare
I will be waiting for you
Frosty fingers tears your spine
Screams, obsession your strength decline
Try to stay sane, to stay awake
Shadows descending it has begun
Into the eternal nightmare
I have been waiting for you
Incarnation of madness within your mind
Trapped in this world a realm of lies
No turning back, a fate concealed
Shadows descending it has begun, begun
Into the eternal nightmare
Into the eternal nightmare
I am the eternal nightmare
