Blessed be, beloved
On a loving spree for each other
For the love of giving, for the gift of living
Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder
'Cause it's a spiritual alliance
A dangerous defiance
Everybody needs everybody
Independence is a lie
NOCTURNAL RITES
A glimpse of sweet mistery
NOCTURNAL RITES
So here is my confession
I'm stuck with an obsession
Yet far beyond expression
Black hearts, bleeding
Percepetions can be misleading
For the soul searching, for a thrills emerging
Cloud nine awaits where spirits reside
'Cause it's a holy rite of passage
A ceremonial message
Certain flowers close at night
Others wither without love
NOCTURNAL RITES
An odour of sancity
NOCTURNAL RITES
This is the vernal equinox
Now in the flower of youth
Still on the verge of tears again
If love's a lie, then what's the truth?
Milagros
Estamos hechos el uno para el otro
To coin a phrase,
Birds of a feather flock together
She's a star in embryo
A role model, en route
She's innocence incarnate
And it the garden, she's my fruit
True light healing
Or underhand dealing?
Whatever, my peruvian child
In front of you, I'm kneeling
'Cause you're
Eternally, my inomorata
NOCTURNAL
Send me just a few grains of confort
And I'll soon stand proud and free
NOCTURNAL RITES
A rite of real symmetry
NOCTURNAL RITES
Embrancing you endlessly
NOCTURNAL RITES
A touch of true harmony
NOCTURNAL RITES
Your arms, my sanctuary
