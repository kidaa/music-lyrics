A forgotten book - Surrounded by hate
Hidden since the dawn of time - Ancient rhymes
Unholy thoughts - Dimensions for the fool to tred
A thousand souls - Imprisoned within - Trapped for evermore
A scripture of evil - Unknown to mankind
It has fallen into oblivion - Enchantment lurks
Between the lines - A power, too strong to tame
Cherish the cross, hold on to your faith ... The fact still remains
In the deep of souls - The seeds of hate was sown
And in the mind of man shall evil unfold
Necronomicon ex-mortis - The book of the dead
Burn the book - Free the spirits kept within
Burn the book - Release them from the tomb
[Lead : Mike, Marco, Mike, Marco, Mike, Marco]
In the depths of darkness dwells a power beyond all human sense
A supernatural force will conceal our destiny
Beware of the writ - Don't disturb the force
Despair will increase - Where death appears ...
[Lead : Conny]
Behold, our future is dark - I'm ridden by fears
For what is yet unknown - Death will be taking ist toll
And leave none untouched - So it is written, it shall be done
[Lead : Marco]
Spell has thrived - Time out of mind
It will seal the fate of man - Envisage the terror
The content will spread - Twilight is yet to come
The dawn will die and mankind too - Hope and faith is gone
In the deep of souls - The seeds of hate was sown
And in the mind of man shall evil unfold
Necronomicon ex-mortis - The book of the dead
Withstand the book of the dead
The final damnation of man
All water will turn to blood and the sky above will turn as black as the fate we fear
[Lead : Mike]
... The arrival of Armageddon
