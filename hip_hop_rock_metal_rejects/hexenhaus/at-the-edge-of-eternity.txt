Here I lay, embraced with pain
Few are my final words
An angel of light, beside my bed
Coming to take me away
Sinner
Blasphemous
Sinner
A contemplated soul, a life in vain
Infinity is calling my name
I welcome death, my only friend
Tranquility forever more
Sinner
Blasphemous
Sinner
The angel won't take me away
No holy ground for me
Suicide, self deception, desecration
North of the church, my burial place
A sinner set aside
A misguided faith, to love and light
Made me enter the path of least resistance
I opened my veins, a quick relief
My infinite insight of disbelief
Mourn not those, who is about to die
But those who'll be reborn
Christ won't save me now
Eternal life, obsession of man
Death is my final choice
In life I was weak, in death I will fly
Outcast from heaven forever
A last sanctuary awaits me
My life has burned out
Time to die
Behold my hour of dying
No epitaph
Behold my hour of dying
I bid my last farewell
As the wings of pain
Carry me to the kingdom of death
I know that this is my final sleep
Out of time, out of space
I am forever I am free
Behold my hour of dying
No epitaph
Behold my hour of dying
I bid my last farewell
