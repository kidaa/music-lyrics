Father, forgive me for I've sinned
Evil called my name
An ancient demon invoked in me
The one to shoulder the blame
Cast from heaven the angel if light
A legend yet alive
Scorn and malice was born in me
How pale was not life
I fall from grace
War in my mind
No love, no light
Just pain and hate
Incubus, incubus
[Lead : Mike]
Demonic possession drained of life
Empty staring eyes
A promise of fortune, eternal youth
A spiders web of lies
Deadly bargain what did I get
The cold caress of death
I cry for mercy, who owns my soul
But silent is my call
[Lead : Marco]
I fall from grace
War in my mind
No love, no light
Just pain and hate
Incubus, incubus
Incubus, incubus
