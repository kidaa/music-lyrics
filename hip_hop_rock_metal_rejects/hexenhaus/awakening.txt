[Lead : Mike]
Weighed down with intuitions under waves of anguish and fear
Our future world is bequeathed a legacy of evil pressage to bear
We must gather our thoughts - Prepare to face a forthcoming fall
Death is life close at hand - A nessecary measury, unleash this call
Pay heed to premonitions - Reveal clear facts to save mankind
Mother earth we've inherited from ancestors time out of mind
Drems of love are shattered - Submission to folly has led us astray
The calm before the storm rearrange what makes man decay
Let's call the awakening
Let's call the awakening
[Lead : Mike & Marco]
We dwell within the measurable distance of ruin
Behold the hatred among us all
Twilight, descending from above seek your shelter
Beyond the horizon of time
Weighed down with intuitions - Reveal clear facts to save mankind
Our future world is bequeathed - From ancestors time out of mind
Dreams of love are shattered - Prepare to face a forthcoming fall
The calm before the storm - We ought to obey this exhortation
Let's call the awakening
In the hands of a child lies the age of tomorrow
A guidance to our future through sadness and sorrow
