As the shining steel cuts through your skin
Let the feast now begin
The lust of blood posesses my mind
I'm burning deep within
I'm the one to end it all
A misguided breed, a vicious call
When you feel the blade penetrate your flesh
A rendez-vous with your fate
Screams in the night
A sacrificial rite
The outcome of my hate
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes
I'm an evil devil in disguise
A temptation makes me kill the innocent sacrifice
A soul set free to fly up from the sea of blood
A mutilation in cold blood
All performed in demetia
I enticed you, my child with malicious intent
No tears at regret will ever stain my eyes
[Lead : Marco & Mike / Theme : Mike & Marco]
Violent morbid deeps echoes in my head
Thoughts of maim in the past
Stabbed in the back
Delivered to death
I'll escape the corpse at last
Intoxicated by your cries
I'll find a new child to entice
A temptation makes me kill the innocent sacrifice
A soul set free to fly up from the sea of blood
