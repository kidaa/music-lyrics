Cleanse your mind and follow us
The righteous ones
Leave the error of your ways
Wayward child
Put your trust in our hands
Join the blind
We bring violence with a purpose
What do you know?
Welcome to the house of lies
Welcome to the house of lies
I see through you and all your kind
Malicious breed
I know that your aims are false
A pack of lies
The trust of people that you have earned
Undeserved
The price is paid in our blood
Genocide
Welcome to the house of lies
Welcome to the house of lies
Welcome to the house of lies
Welcome to the house of lies
I will never see, see like you
I will never think, think like you
I will never be, be what you are
We pay a fair price for your quest
What do you say?
Hear nothing, see nothing
Close your eyes
Welcome to our land of plenty
You will never die
Utopia behind iron bars
Land of the free?
Welcome, welcome to the house of lies
Welcome, welcome to the house of lies
Welcome, welcome to the house of lies
Welcome to the house of lies
