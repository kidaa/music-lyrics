Everyone Wants to Live Forever 

Imagination, that's the way that it seems
Man can't only live in his dreams
Oh, it seems so hard.
If I'd lived a thousand times before
And if I'm gonna live anymore
Always brings me down 

Everyone wants to live forever
Thinkin' that it'd be a lot better
Everyone wants to live for ever, whoah
The feeling in my head starts heading south
It seems it stops the fever from shootin' out of my mouth
Life gushing all around 

Everyone wants to live forever
Thinkin' that it'd be a lot better
Everyone wants to live forever, whoah
