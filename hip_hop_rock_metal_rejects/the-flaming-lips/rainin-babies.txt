What I'm thinkin' is so delicate
If I breathe, you know, I'm gonna lose it
It's just a drop in the biggest ocean I know I've ever seen
And in a moment it's big enough to drown the whole world 

This is my present to the world
And I want you to take it
This is my present to the world
Take it from me, please please take it from me 

All I know is I don't know it
It's rainin' babies from the sky down on me
Tiny drops on my windshield
And in a second it's rainin' rainin' all over the whole world
