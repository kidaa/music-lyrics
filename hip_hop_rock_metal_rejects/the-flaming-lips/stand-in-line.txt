Ten men stand in line
At the gates of the cemetery on Tuesday morning
They're not open today
And ten moms stand in line
At maternity ward
They're not bringin' no babies out to play
Anytime today

What's a nice girl like you doin'
Walkin' around this part of town?
See you sometime tomorrow


And ten men stand in line
Waitin' for some personality to be put out on the corner
Today ain't garbage day
Ain't no grabage taken today
