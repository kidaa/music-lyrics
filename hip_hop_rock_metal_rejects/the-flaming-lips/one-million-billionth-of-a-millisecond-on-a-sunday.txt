Early in the mornin', just before the dawn
I turn my t.v. on and watch the fuzz
The sun scrapes away the first layers of the day
Nothing is meant; this is a beautiful accident
This could be the sunrise, or I could be wrong
'cause sometimes what looks like the sunrise
Turns out to be an atom bomb
Bombs are comin' in cereal packages 2x
Early in the morning, just before the dawn
I turn my t.v. on and watch the fuzz
