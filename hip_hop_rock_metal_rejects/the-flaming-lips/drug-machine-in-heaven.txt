Every time that we fly together
Our plane blows up in the sky
We're workin' in an explosives factory
Cause we don't care if we die 

Everything, everything, everything that I wish
Give us a 20th century Jesus guy
And he could make us rich 

You've known me for a million years
And I've been chewed up by all your gears
I don't wanna be no one else
I like it here, 'cause I like hell.
