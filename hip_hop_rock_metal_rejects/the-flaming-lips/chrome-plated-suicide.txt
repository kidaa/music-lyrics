If all my dreams were a tidal wave
And every day was Christmas
We could spend our lives in the drip
At the edge of the world 

Cause love does things that you can't see
It's like telepathic surgery
And cuts and scrapes just like Iggy Pop thrown in a hole 

If you take away my nerves
And leave just my words
Love would be the best thing in the world 

You and me in a chrome reflection
We were born to suffer some
Please don't chase me from this jail
You know it looks so nice 

If all my dreams were a microwave
And every day was summer
When I feel this way, you know
We should start our own religion 

If you take away my nerves
And leave just my words
Love would be the best thing in the world
And if you take away my pain
Please don't leave my brain
Cause when I think it hurts just the same
