Boy, you play so loud that you could wake the dead
And some of the living, they're wakin' too
When I look outside and these worlds collide
And sends shit flyin' everywhere 

And everything's explodin'
And these cars are crashin' and everybody's happy
Everything's explodin'
And these cars are crashin' yeah 

When I look in my mirror and my brains are fallin' out
Of my head...
Well, there's nothing wrong, it's just the way I feel
And if you don't like it, write your own song
