Stuck in the perpetual motion
Dying against the machine
The whole thing leaves
You a nothing instead of a these
The sun is black and the black halos fly
And your number is backwards again when you try
The sound is so cute when you're 22
When you're 22

Eggs break when you walk on the scramble
You're living against the machine
The whole thing leaves
You a nothing instead of a these
The bone is cracked and the cracked eggshells fly
And your number is backwards again when you drive
The whole thing's removed when you're 22
When you're 22
