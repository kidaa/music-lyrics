Their wasn't any snow on Christmas eve and I knew what I
should do, I thought I'd free the animals all locked up at the zoo
I opened up the fence where the peacocks were, the lamas were
unleashed the snakes and seals could all get out, but they 
Refused to leave....

All of the animals agreed they're not happy at the zoos
But they preferred to save themselves, they seemed to think
they could...

The elephants, orangutans, all the birds and kangaroos all said
thanks but no thanks man, but to be concerned is good...

It started to snow on Christmas Eve in the middle of the night
walkin through the state park zoo and everything is white...
