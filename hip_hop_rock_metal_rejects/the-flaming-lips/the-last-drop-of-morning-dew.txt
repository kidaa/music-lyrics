I think the state of mind that I'm in
We should drop it right now
Well you've got yourself to blame
If you need these sunny days
And all those plans that I made
They're all changed by the end of the day
'Cause God fucked up when he made us
'Cause he made us so we could hate us
And the world could end in a second
