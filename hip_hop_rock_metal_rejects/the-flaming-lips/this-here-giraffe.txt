I saw this bird fly off his head
without him ever lookin up 
this here giraffe was never caught complainin
he wouldn't take skin off yer back.

And ya hear yerself
thinkin
and ya hear yerself
thinking
this here giraffe, laughedI saw this man stick out his neck
with his binoculars intact
He couldn't tell the right side of his brain
Had just lost all interest in his left...
And ya feel yourself shrinkin
And ya feel yourself shrinkin
this here giraffe, laughed
this here giraffe, laughed
And ya hear yourself
And ya hear yourself
