Jesus Song No. 5 
Waitin' for my ride
Jesus is floatin' outside
Shine on, sweet Jesus, on me
Watchin' the water rise
I'm gettin' lost in the tide
Cry all your teardrops on me
While I'm still myself,
Your blankets covered me
Covered me while I was still asleep 

Watchin' the planets shine
Reflecting yourself in the sky
Shine on, sweet Jesus, on me
Scraping these smiles of mine
Impossible one at a time
Cry all your teardrops on me
While I'm still myself,
Your blankets covered me
Covered me while I was still asleep Jesus is at my side,
Wondering what he will find
Shine on, sweet Jesus, on me
Watchin' the water rise
I'm gettin' lost in the tide
Cry all your teardrops on me
While I'm still myself
Your blankets covered me
Covered me while I was still asleep
