Yeah, 'cause when I drive in my car
We put heads in jars
So take me please, take me to Mars
I wanna go where they are 2x
I wanna go

Yeah, and if I'm lost, well I don't care
'cause I walk on endless stairs
You say it's me, I think it's you
Who can blame us for thinkin' the way we do
'cause we don't care what we are 2x 

Take me please, take me to Mars 3x
Take me to Mars 5x
