This is the last song ever written
About trains and brains and rain.
Ain't it a sin? 

For these good lyrics,
I have no fears.
They've all got roles and plots and gears,
They have for years. 

Train is running around in my brains.
Rain is flowing around in my veins.
Tears are running down my face,
For the last stupid song. Let's get on board
This scattered brain.
Folks drunk as poets all sound the same,
But don't be afraid. 

For this surprise,
If he was with us,
Is that we played this track for you,
And please some tears. 

Train is running around in my brains.
Rain iss flowing around in my veins.
Tears are running down my face,
For the last stupid song.
