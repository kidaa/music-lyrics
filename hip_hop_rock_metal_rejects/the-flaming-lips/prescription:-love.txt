I been wandering for quite a while
When it seems like love is all around
Seems when people can't get love
They substitute it with a bunch of drugs
If love was a drug that was real cheap
Everybody could get some sleep

I been wandering for quite a while
When it seems like love is all around
Seems when love don't get to far
They buy a real expensive car
If love was a car that was real cheap
Everybody would drive a jeep 

Let's give love the marketing scam
Let's give love the marketing scam
Make it something they can understand
Let's give love the marketing scam
Let's give love the marketing scam
And get on with it I've been wandering for quite a while
When it seems like love is all around
Seems when people don't have nobody
They spend their time makin' lots of money
If love was money and it was cheap
Everybody could get some sleep
