You're sorta stuck where you are
But, in your dreams you can buy expensive cars,
or live on mars
and have it your way

And you hate your boss at your job
well in your dreams you can blow his head off
in your dreams
show no mercy

And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end
You have to sleep late when you can
And all your bad days will end
repeat
