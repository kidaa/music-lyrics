I got this can of gasoline, you know what I mean
I got it just for burnin' and it keeps the sirens turnin'
Turning down existence it seems to burn all by itself 

I wish that something would happen just so I'd get a reaction
From all these bucks I'm earnin', it keeps the sirens turnin'
Turnin' down existence it seems to burn all by itself
And we don't care 

So I just keep on smiling while all the bad compiling
My teeth are white and burning, it keeps the sirens turnin'
