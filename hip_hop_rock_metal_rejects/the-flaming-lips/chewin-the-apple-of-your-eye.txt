hey what were ya thinkin
when they were startin the show
yeah, i was there
but i didn't care at all
i was tryin to find you
when you gost lost in the crowd
cus i'm drunk all the time
i like your helium voice

CHORUS
there was a guy in the seat next to mine
watchin the girls when the cops made us stand in line


yea, so if its sad
well you still gotta live till ya die
man, everyone's chewin the apple you got in your eye
it like at the circus
when you get lost in the crowd
your happy but nervous
definite sign that you lost it


CHORUS
