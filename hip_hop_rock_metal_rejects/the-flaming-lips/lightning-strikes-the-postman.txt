I got yer letter it had turned to sand, lighting strikes the postman in
his hand, I hope that you remember the things you had to say, it's just
a supernatural delay... I got yer package it was all a mess, lightning strikes
the postman in his chest, I hope that you remember the things you 
had to
say, it's just a supernatural delay...
I sent you a postcard and I hope yer fine
But lightning strike the postman all the time
I couldn't really think of anything to say
It's just a supernatural delay,
And it's hard to read the writing through the flames...
