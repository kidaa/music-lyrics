I didn't care when that guy ripped us off
We borrowed a gun to get him, we were so pissed off
We shot his leg. He was a dick, anyway 

It felt good to burn. Felt like a movie star
When you hold my slippery brain
Kiss my forehead


All summer long we refused to die
We just sucked and fucked and got high
And all we'd steal. We lit up on the Ferris wheel Felt good to burn. Felt like a movie star
When you hold my slippery brain
Kiss my forehead 

And all your dreams, and oh, God blessed your soul
I saw you were holdin' your head
But we couldn't have been dead
'cause you stood up and moaned and said,
";I wasn't wavin' goodbye, I was sayin' hello.";
