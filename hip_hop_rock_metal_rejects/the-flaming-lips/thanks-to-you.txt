I want to thank you
You've been the meaning of life for me
Now I can see the real me
Feelings I couldn't bear
All the things I wouldn't dare
Times I thought no one cared
Then I looked at you
You were there 

Sometimes I think this has all been a dream
But I wake up to find that it's not what it seems in my mind
It's all mine 

Feelings I couldn't bear
All the things I wouldn't dare
Times I thought no one cared
Then I looked at you
You were there 

People don't know what the songs are about
They just sing them out like they mean
Something we never thought about
