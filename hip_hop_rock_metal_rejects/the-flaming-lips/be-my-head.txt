You can be my head
Oh, I really need one
'cause it's used all its better days
You can be my head
'cause I've ruined this one
Blasting holes where it used to be

And if it's not a big thing,
You could swap or lend me
You should stop and ask me


Be my head, and I'll be yours 2x You can be my head
Oh, they've eaten this one
Putting swirls in this giant hole
You can be my head
'cause I can't afford to buy one
Seeking stars in its other side


And if it's not a big thing,
You could swap or lend me
You should stop and ask me


Be my head, and I'll be yours 2x
Won't you be my head, and I'll be yours
Be my head and I'll be yours 3x
