This man was walking, down by the curb,
He had lost his saddle in the mud.
This guy was crying, tears from his eyes,
Part of his body was paralyzed. 

I thought it was a dream.
Strangest thing I've seen.
O'er and o'er and over, 'til I think I don't exist. 

So I went up to him, and asked him what
He was doing, and who he was.
He said his memory had been dilluted,
He said he once was electrocuted. I thought it was a dream.
Strangest thing I've seen.
O'er and o'er and over, 'til I think I don't exist. 

He said he'd come from Pakistan,
Where he was beaten by a policeman.
That's why he walked, a duty crawl.
And acted like he knew it all. 

I thought it was a dream.
Strangest thing I've seen.
O'er and o'er and over, 'til I think I don't exist.
