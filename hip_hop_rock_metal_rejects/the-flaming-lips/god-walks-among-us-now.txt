Jesus Song No. 6 

How does it feel to be breakin' apart
Breakin' down molecules
How does it feel to out of control
Another ring around this ball 

Used to be all right
But things got strange


How does it feel to be fallin' apart
Sinkin' from the bottom down
It's not so easy holdin' it up
With everything fallin' down
Used to be all right
But things got strange
Used to take all night
But things've changed and God walks among us now 

Used to be all right
But things got strange
Used to be uptight
But things've changed and God walks among us now 

How does it feel to be fallin' apart
With everything breakin' down
How does it feel to be fallin' apart
Imagine how holdin' on
