Autopsy of the Devil's Brain 

You have to be joking
They wouldn't do what you said
Oh, my vision is blurred again 

You have to be kiddin' me
They wouldn't do those unspeakable things
Oh, my Jesus
It's worse than you think 

Stood here in the morning
Got no science to explain
Seems to me that God and the devil
Are both the same 

You have to be lyin'
They wouldn't do what you told me about
Oh, my vision is blurred again 2x
