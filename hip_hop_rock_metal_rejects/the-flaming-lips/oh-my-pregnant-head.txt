Labia In The Sunlight 

when will you shut your mouth
stop all the vibrate
birds flying out of a mountain
somewhere the snow cools my fever
i just have stumps left for fingers
wonderin' can you still play guitar?

just like a baby
just like the smoke rings
labia in the sunlight
when will you stop all yours buzzing
smow crushing hummingbird
all day
somewhere the star burns the universe
gold eagle paints in my fingers
all day
can of spaghetti diseases
hopin that you can still play guitar?


just like a baby
just like the smoke rings
labia in the sunlight


labia in the sunlight
repeat 6 times
