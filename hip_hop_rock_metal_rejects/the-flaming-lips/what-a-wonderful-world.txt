I see trees of green, red roses too
I see 'em bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed days, and dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world The colors of the rainbow
Are so pretty in the sky
It's also on the faces
Of people goin' by
I see friends shakin' hands
Sayin', ";How do you do?";
Fairies sayin', ";I love you."; 

I hear babies cry, and I watch 'em grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I think to myself, what a wonderful world
