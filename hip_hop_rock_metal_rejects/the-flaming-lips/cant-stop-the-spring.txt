You can walk among us, but you can't walk on by
You just keep on bleedin' on your clothes as they dry
All your teflon pancakes always make me too high
You're thinkin' that you're here but you're really up in the sky 

There she was just walkin' down the street
Smoking with her hands and walking with her feet
Keeping her paint cans underneath the seat
Keepin' her hair dryer on her favorite piece of meat 

You can crush the flowers
But you can't stop the spring
No matter what you say


So you can put the clouds up in your own little way
But the sun is gonna come up the very next day
It's gonna be so bright it's gonna blow you away
And once it's over your head will never be the same
