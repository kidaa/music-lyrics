This is an old Godzilla flick,
This is an old Godzilla flick.
People that you love,
are never going to say ";hello"; again.
And it's only in the movies. 

This is an old Godzilla flick.
This is an old Clint Eastwood flick.
People that you love,
shouldn't take the life out of themselves.
And it's only in the movies. 

This is an old Godzilla flick.
This is an old Godzilla flick.
This is an old Godzilla flick.
And no this time I think it's really it.
And it's only in the movies.
