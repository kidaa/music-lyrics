What I can't see, I surely can't believe
What I can't see, you know I can't believe
It's only natural that I can't believe
What I can't see 

I've seen the birds fly,
Watched the crashing tide
Talked a million miles away


Run through open fields
Heard the words of those who kneel
Still I wondered how to steal your love
But I never could believe in me 

What've I gotta do to make you see me?
Should I lay down and cry
Maybe I should just die
'cause I really can't exist if you don't see me
