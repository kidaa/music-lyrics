It has always been in the back of my mind 
dreaming about going to the corners of time 
i always wanted to fly in strange machines 
i wanna do centuries in a lifetime 
and feel it with my hands 
touch the world war II and Cleopatra 
flying... 
could it be that my dream would come true 
building a machine that would actually do 
what i want it to do 
russian revolution, let's do that in one day 
Beethoven and Gershwin i think that would be o.k. 
more than anything i wanna fly in strange machines 
i wanna do centuries in a lifetime 
and see it with my eyes 
watch Jesus rise, if he ever did 
flying... 
i wanna do centuries in a lifetime 
and feel it with my hands 
touch renaissance and Chaka Khan 
flying...
