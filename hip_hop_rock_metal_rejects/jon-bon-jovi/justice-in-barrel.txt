There's no country, there's no freedom 
There's no you, there's no me 
There's no justice, there's no justice, there's no justice 

Hey mister can you help me 
I'm a loner on the run 
I'm just looking for tomorrow 
And I ain't gonna hurt no one 

I jumped headfirst into a bottle 
I was looking for a friend 
Came up just short of nothing 
I didn't find the truth, I only found an end 

So tell me who's gonna save me 
Or my father or my son 
When the only justice a man can see 
Is the barrel of a loaded gun, oh yeah 

I been broke and I've been hungry 
I think they're both my middle name, ooh 
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough 
Still guess I guess complain 

'Cause what you get in life you take it 
You've gotta hold on, make it last, ooh 
They say good things come to those who wait 
But it's life that goes so fast 

And when there's just one rule you live by 
Each day you kiss the rising sun 
When you live and die by the life we breathe 
In the barrel of a loaded... 

Gun talk to me in my sleep at night 
And a gun somewhere is burning with my name 

[Guitar solo]

Winners are losers 
And losers will have to face all those yesterdays 
And all of the dreams they blew away 

So Mister can you help me or are you my gun 
Have the ghosts of justice brought you here to me to taste, ooh 
The barrel of a loaded gun 

There's justice in the barrel of a loaded gun 
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun 
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun 
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
