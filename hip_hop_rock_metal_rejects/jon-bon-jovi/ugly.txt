If you're ugly, I'm ugly too 
In your eyes the sky's a different blue 
If you could see yourself like others do 
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you, yeah 

And I wish I was a camera sometimes 
So I could take your picture with my mind 
Put it in a frame for you to see 
How beautiful you really are to me 

Ugly, ugly 
All of us just feel like that some days 
Ain't no rainbow in the sky, when you feel U.G.L.Y. 
And that's ugly, yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Ugly, ugly 
All of us just feel like that some days 
Ain't no rainbow in the sky, when you feel U.G.L.Y. 
And that's ugly, ugly 
All of us just feel like that some days 
Ain't no cure that you can buy 
When you feel U.G.L.Y. 
And that's ugly 

So if you're ugly, I'm ugly too 
If you're a nut, then I must be a screw 
If you could see yourself the way I do 
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you, yeah 
I wish I was as beautiful as you
