Well you're dancing with the shadow 
You been talking in your sleep 
Well you can walk on water 
But don't want to wet your feet 

You really got me, you really got me now 
You know I don't know how you do it 
But you really put me through it 
You got me, yeah 

You say you talk to everyone 
Who is anyone in town 
But they don't recognize you 
With your feet out of your mouth 

You really got me, you really got me now, yeah 
You know I don't know how you do it 
But you really drive me through it 
You got me 

Who am I to judge a man who says that's he's his own biggest fan 
It's true / Richard... 

[Piano solo]

You brought a knife out to a gunfight 
And you're shouting that I'm dead 
My old friends Smith and Wesson 
Think you're in over your head 

You really got me, you really got me now 
You know I don't know how you do it 
But you really drive me through it 
You got me now 

You really got me, you really got me now 
You burn your bridges baby 
You know I don't know how you do it 
But you really put me through it 
You got me, yeah
