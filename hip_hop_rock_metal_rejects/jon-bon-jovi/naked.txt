My friend had a girlfriend 
She liked her drink 
Sucked the head off her lager 
Threw me a wink 
And she sang to me, "Buddy, what's your sign" 

I was off, I was runnin' 
Knocked me clean off my feet 
Her tongue kept on selling 
What any blind man could see 
And I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs 

She said, "What's you hiding underneath that shirt" 
Right behind the buttons there's a heart that hurts 
Adam's evening left the curse 
Take it off make it work 

Naked, naked - just get back to basics, yeah 
Naked, face it - you can't fake it when you're naked 
Naked naked face it 
All I'm saying 

The tail you been chasing 
Put the K back in kink 
Threw a coin in her jukebox 
I started to think 
But she just smiled and offered me a peace sign 

How far you gonna run in those designer shoes  
The soul with holes ain't gonna be the one you lose 
I don't know which one is worse: Adam, me or you 

Naked, naked - just get back to basics, yeah 
Naked, face it - you can't fake it when you're naked 
Naked naked face it 
All I'm saying 

[Guitar solo]

Take it, embrace it 
Baby, here we are 
Can't you almost ... taste it 

Naked, naked - just get back to basics yeah 
Naked, face it - you can't fake it when you're naked 
Naked naked, naked naked naked, naked naked naked, naked naked naked
