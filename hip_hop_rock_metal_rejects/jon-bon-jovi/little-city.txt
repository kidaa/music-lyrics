I got my call light on, gimme one more fare tonight 
Just get me over the bridge, I can see those shiny bay lights 
You know I'm never alone but I'm feeling lonely tonight 
Damn, I got my last cigarette but I ain't got no light 

God let these wheels roll to where the girls are pretty 
Where the nights explode and life is still living 
Down this open road, the arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

In my rear view mirror, I see someone else's hairline 
I hear that fire in your eyes is on the rock and doing hard time 
And the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine 
There's wine in this dirt 
Here love ain't love, tt's just another four letter word 

God let these wheels roll to where the girls are pretty 
Where the nights explode and life is still living 
Down this open road, the arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

shalalalalala, shalalalalala, shalalalalala, oh 
shalalalalala, shalalalalala, shalalalalala, oh 

God let these wheels roll to where the girls are pretty 
Where the nights explode and life is still living 
Down this open road, the arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

Now that cold gray fog's just a rolling down the highway 
He's come to carry me home 
It puts a little smile on my face 

Yeah, roll with me baby 
I can see those daylights calling me home 
Yeah, I'm never alone 
Just turn the radio on 
There's an old song I used to know
