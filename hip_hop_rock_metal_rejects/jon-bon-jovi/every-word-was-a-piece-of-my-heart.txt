I've been staring at the page for what seems like days 
I guess I put this one off for a while 
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes  
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried  
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you hey now 
Hey now, I guess the night's just bringing me down 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart hey now 

You've been the blood in my veins 
The only one who knows my middle name 
And the smiles, they came easy 'cause of you hey now 
You know that I love you, but I hate you 
'Cause I know I can never escape you 
So let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark hey now 
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud  

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart hey now 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart hey now 

Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch 
Maybe I've lost my guts 
There, is that truth enough  
Hey now, hey now... 

[Guitar solo]

You know these love letters mix with whisky 
Just don't light a match when you kiss me 
Though I'll blow away, you know I'll be back soon hey now 
Hey now, hey now, hey now, am I talking just a little too loud  

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart hey now 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
Hey now, am I talking just a little too proud  
Hey now, the night's just bringing me down
