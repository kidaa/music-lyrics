[William Bonney:] "Yoo-hoo, I'll make you famous!" 

I just seen trouble, he's calling out your name tonight 
Billy get your guns 
You could walk away but I know you were born to fight 
So Billy get your guns 
The bandileros are strung out in the promenade 
Billy get your guns 
And the wind whispers softly that the devil's to blame 
Billy get your guns 

Billy get your guns 
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane 
Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the price of fame 
And it'll never change 
Billy get your guns 

There's a whiskey bottle empty sittin' on the bar 
Billy get your guns 
And some organ grinder singing about some sucker moving on 
Billy get your guns 
All the whores are hanging out waiting to get paid 
Billy get your guns 
From some Johnny on the spot who said hey keep the change baby 
Billy get your guns 

Billy get your guns 
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane 
Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the price of fame 
And it'll never change 
No, Billy get your guns 

They christened you with whiskey 
And there's fire running through your veins 
Well you're an outlaw just the same 
And every night a bullet wears your name 

[Guitar solo]

Billy get your guns 
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane 
Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the price of fame 
And it'll never change 
No, Billy get your guns 

I've seen a hangman dancing beneath the pale moonlight 
Billy get your guns 
And every stranger that you meet thinks it's his lucky night 
Billy get your guns 
I don't envy you Billy but I want to say 
You better get your guns 
'Cause every outlaw that's died will live to ride again 
Billy get your guns 

Billy get your guns 
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane 
Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the price of fame 
And it'll never change 
Billy get your guns, Billy get your guns 
Billy get your guns, Billy get your guns
