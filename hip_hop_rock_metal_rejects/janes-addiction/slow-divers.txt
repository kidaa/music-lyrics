She said, ";Do you think you could?";
And I said, ";Yeah, in a second...";
I'm sitting by a waterfall
And when people jump in
They hold their nose
And kiss these walls
Granite walls,
Water-polished walls
Just don't ever want to move from this spot
You can sit here for so long!
There's a slide, suislide,
You can live or die
Going down, going down, go down!
Boy came to the slide
I said, ";You want to go down that slide?";
He said, ";No man,";
";hey you got a joint to sell me?";
We just smoked one,
We got a roach we said...
";I'll smoke the roach!";
But first go down that slide man
Go on down, go on down, go on down!
I'm sitting by a waterfall...
Could bear to watch the people
Slip and fall
You know the plants on the rocks are crazy
Thinking that they could start a life
On the spiral walls of a waterfall!
Slow divers?
Their view is spectacular!
