wish I was ocean size 
they cannot move you 
no one tries no one pulls you 
out from your hole 
like a tooth aching a jawbone...
i was made with a heart of stone 
to be broken 
with one hard blow 
i've seen the ocean 
break on the shore 
come together with no harm done...
it ain't easy living...
i want to be 
as deep 
as the ocean 
mother ocean
some people tell me 
home is in the sky 
in the sky lives a spy 
i want to be more like the ocean
no talking 
all action... 
no talking 
all action
