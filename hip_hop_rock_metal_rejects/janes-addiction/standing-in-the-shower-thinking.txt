Standing in the shower thinking
about what makes a man 
an outlaw or a leader 
i'm thinking about power... 
the ways a man could use it 
or be destroyed by it 
the water hits my neck 
and i'm pissing on myself...
standing 
in the shower 
thinking...
standing in the shower thinking 
about a man i know don't like me 
he don't like the place i'm headed 
same place he's headed
i know he'd beat me to it 
if he could but he won't do it 
but he would man 
if he could... 
and the water is piping hot.. 
the water is piping hot
it beats upon my neck 
and i'm pissing on myself...
standing 
in the shower 
thinking...
standing in the shower thinking 
is my woman afraid of me? 
she's seen how far i've twisted 
it's just cause i can trust her 
and ever since we met 
she understood so she let 
me twist her good... 
i twist her good...
and the water is piping hot 
the water is piping hot 
it beats upon my neck
and i'm pissing on myself...
standing 
in the shower 
thinking
