Had a dad
Big and strong
Turned around
Found my daddy gone
He was the one
Made me what I am today
It's up to me now
My daddy has gone away...
Well I spoke to the mountain
I listened to the sea
Both told me that the fountain
Was the best that you could be
My daddy's hand it growed
Show to the lickin
Sonny boy
Grow to whip him!
If you see my dad
Tell him my brothers
All gone mad
They're beating on each other
I walked around
Even tried to call
Got that funny feeling
He's not there
At all...
