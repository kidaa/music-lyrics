Three days was the morning. 
My focus three days old. 
My head, it landed
To the sounds of cricket bows... 
I am proud man anyway... 
Covered now by three days... 
Three ways was the morning. 
Three lovers, in three ways.
We knew when she landed,
Three days she'd stay. 
I am a proud man anyway...
Covered now by three days... 
We saw shadows of the morning light 
the shadows of the evening sun 
till the shadows and the light were one. 
Shadows of the morning light 
the shadows of the evening sun 
till the shadows and the light were one... 
True hunting is over. 
No herds to follow. 
Without game, men prey on each other.
The family weakens by the bite we swallow...
True leaders gone,
Of land and people. 
We choose no kin but adopted strangers.
The family weakens by the length we travel... 
All of us with wings... 
All of us with wings... 
All of us with wings! 
All of us with wings! 
All of us with wings! 
All of us with wings! 
Erotic Jesus lays with his Marys.
Loves his Marys. 
Bits of puzzle,
Fitting each other. 
All now with wings!
Oh my Marys!
Never wonder...
Night is shelter
For nudity's shiver...
All now with wings...
