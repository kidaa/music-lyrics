Jenny said when she was just five years old
You know there's nothing happenin' at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothing going down at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
Despite all the amputations
You could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station
And it was alright
Jenny said when she was just five years old
My parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Ain't gonna help us at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
She don't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to a rock 'n ' roll station
And it was alright
