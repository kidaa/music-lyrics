My cat's name is Maceo,
He's a little man in a cat's body
He yawns just like I do,
He's convinced I won't eat him
I think he thinks I'm his dad,
Becasue I saved him from the pound
Well we went down, down to the pound
And that's where we saw Maceo
Cat catcher said to me, ";Pick one out,";
Maceo said ";Let me out";
He sleeps right where I do
And we wrestle in the morning!
He come to you if you don't bother him
He just likes to do his own thing
My cat's name is Maceo,
He's a little man in a cat's body
