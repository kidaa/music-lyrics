Man ain't meant to work
C'mon build a machine!
So we can sleep and make love deeper
Later we can dance and we can drink!
Man ain't meant to work
C'mon build a machine!
So we can live for our own pleasure
Please yourself! Please your queens!
Early morning the sun is yawning
I am not kind yet
I am certain, I have no doubt
Life is for playing
Days like these
I hardly disagree
So what! That's my conclusion
I think I'm gonna dig myself now
