oh bay baby im so tired....
the man from the government
the man from the tax report
the man from in the public school
the man owns the golden rule hereI'm everybody's slave
I made you my slave
You said
This I do for you
If it would help
To give the world back
What it gave
Then I would
I would
I would
I would
I would for you
I would for you
You say my eyes
Are crazy eyes
Sometimes they are
And so are you
And if you wonder
What I would do
I would do
Anything
If I could
You know I would
I would
I would
I would for you
I would for you
I would for you
I would for you
I would for you
