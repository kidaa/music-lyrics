fell into 
a sea of grass 
and disappeared among 
the shady blades... 
children all 
ran over me 
screaming tag! 
you are the one!
he trips her as 
her sandals fail 
she says stop! 
i'm a girl... 
whose fingernails are made 
of mother's pearl... 
yellow buttercup 
helicopters
orange buttercat 
chasing after 
the crazy bee 
mad about somebody...
me and my girlfriend 
don't wear no shoes 
her nose is painted pepper
sunlight... 
she loves me 
i mean it's serious 
as serious can be...
she sings a song and 
i listen to what it says: 
if you want a friend
feed any animal... 
there was so much space 
i cut me a piece 
with some fine wine 
it brought peace to my mind 
in the summertime... 
and it rolled 
summer.... oh... 
oh.... the summertime rolls
