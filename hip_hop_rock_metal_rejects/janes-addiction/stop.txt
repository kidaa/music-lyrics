Save the complaints
For a party conversation. 
The world is loaded,
It's lit to pop and nobody is gonna stop... 
No one...
No one!
No way!
Gonna stop,
Now; go! 
Farm people,
Book wavers, soul savers,
Love preachers! 
Lit to pop and nobody is gonna stop. 
No one...
One come a day, the water will run, 
No man will stand for things that he had done... 
Hurrah! 
And the water will run... 
One come a day, the water will run, 
No man will stand for things that he had done... 
Hurrah! 
And the water will run... 
Will Run! 
Will Run!
Gimmie that!
Gimmie that - your automobile,
Turn off that smokestack
And that goddamn radio 
Hum... along with me... 
Hum along with the t.v.
No one's
Gonna 
Stop!
