Everyone doing something but no one ever does anything
Someone always shouting the silence is deafening
Nobody loves you, nobody hates you
Fact or fiction or just contradiction
There is no truth in lies
There is no life that doesn't die
There is no fate but the fate that is due
The order of chaos welcomes you
Knowing is just a feeling & feelings worth nothing
Just keep on searching blind and unseeing
Looking for something seeking nothing
No direction or just contradiction
There is no truth in lies
There is no life that doesn't die
There is no fate but the fate that is due
The order of chaos welcomes you
RPT
Discipline oustanding, nothing like working
Hoping and trying, keep on adjusting
Sometimes hopeless, never painless
Simple addiction or just contradiction
There is no truth in lies
There is no life that doesn't die
There is no fate but the fate that is due
