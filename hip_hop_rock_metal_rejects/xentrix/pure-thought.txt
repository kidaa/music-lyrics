Subject to your own scrutiny.
Reflect on what you say.
Connected indirectly,
Perfect in every way.
Aware of every movement.
Commit to memory.
Not easy to ignore but
Too easy to believe.

To trust in your own judgement,
And keep an open mind.
Evaluation silent,
Confusion killing time.
Meaningless information
Implanted deep within.
Hours of intense frustration,
Your needs are genuine.

A single thought, no shape, no form.
To analyse and criticise, lost and yet unborn.
Feeds on itself and wants for nothing more. 
Untouchable, invisible, your whole mind to explore.

Your thoughts you cannot purify.
The need to dominate and occupy.
The urge to win and not to be ruled, you just cannot deny.

Premature senility.
Uncontrollable decay.
A loss of your ability,
All functions waste away.
Untouched by conscience feeling,
Invisible to all.
After a time revealing,
Your unable to recall.

A single thought...
Your thoughts...
