A moral certainty
A vast controvacy
Debate the hate or recreate
A time that never should have been
Infallability
Is no necessity
Release the peace
& understand just what that means
Divided we fall
Not one but one all
When all's done
We all bleed red
We all bleed red
An understanding
Can be demanding
Retrieve believe
Back to a world that you might think
Don't be the hated
Don't be dictated
Enlight the right
And maybe then we'll make the link
Divided we fall
Not one but one all
When all's done
We all bleed red
We all bleed red
