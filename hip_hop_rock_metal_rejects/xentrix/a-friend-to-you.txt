Show me your fear, causing the hate
Look at myself
I hear your words, anticipate
I am your wealth
The one who tells you when & when not to conform
The one you cannot see
I am to you
The friend you'll never know
Each phase of life
A new scenario
I think your thoughts, I see your dreams
I speak the truth
I watch you move, collaborate
I am your youth
The one who tells you what is right and what is wrong
The one you want to be
I am to you
The friend you'll never know
Each phase of life
A new scenario
We are one, you can confide in me
We are one, you cannot hide from me
I am to you
The friend you'll never know
Each phase of life
A new scenario  
I am to you
