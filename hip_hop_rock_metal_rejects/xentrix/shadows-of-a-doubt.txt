The reality of not knowing
After the curtain falls,
Breeds a fear deep inside
That runs through us all.

Selfish curiosity,
Self-made reasoning.
Is it for real, your paradise?
Or just a symptom of your mind?
Can you conceive? Can you believe?
Beyond your own shadows of doubt.

When you look into yourself
What do you see?
And do you think that what you are
Will always be?

Inner sanctuary.
Dream immortality.
Is it for real, your paradise?
Or just a symptom of your mind?
Can you conceive? Can you believe?
Beyond your own shadows of doubt.Do you go your own way?
Or do you answer the call?
Do you cower and fear for your soul?
Or just laugh at it all.

Popular philosophy
Or plain insecurity.

Is it for real, your paradise?
Or just a symptom of your mind?
Can you conceive? Can you believe?
Beyond your own shadows of doubt.
