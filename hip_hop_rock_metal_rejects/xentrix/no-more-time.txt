Look around this place and see just what is happening
Tomorrow we will suffer for the way that we have been
Its our own lives we're shortening
While everyone pretends that there is nothing to explain
Poisons & neglected relics out live us & always will be
Justified by what we gain
No more time
Mans greed corrupt & unconcerned
No more time look around you will we ever learn
As bought time ticks away we must think carefully and choose
Forget about our future or learn to live with limitations
Knowing what we've got to lose
So many things to work for many more to work against
Everything disposable resources unreplacable
All profits at our world expense
No more time
Mans greed corrupt & unconcerned
No more time look around you will we ever learn
Mass produced solutions idealistic luxury
Facts & figures always quited calculated to mislead us
Always taken literally
People making so much money wanting only more
Causing so much misery taking from a place
That no one bothers to restore
No more time
Mans greed corrupt & unconcerned
No more time will we ever learn
