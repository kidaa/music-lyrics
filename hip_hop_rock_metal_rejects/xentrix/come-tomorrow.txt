Looking back through the pages of my life
All thats gone before needed nothing more
Only you to say
Never thinking only doing for myself
Always in your debt now I feel regret
I knew no other way
Thinking now its all too late for tears
No more can be done
Never see the sun
Never see the day
Never see the day
Ignorance, all things come to an end
Why leave it all like this
I will know no other way
Never see the sun, never see the day
Know no way, no way
Innocence, I search for who I am
I know that I was wrong
Hard enough nothing I can say
Never see the sun. never see the day
Know no way, no way
Thinking now its all too late for tears
No more can be done
Never see the sun
