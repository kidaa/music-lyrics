The power of menace is the spirit of an age
Without doubt
Without prejudice & shame
I see through you
I see through you
There's no reward without suffering
He who has nothing
Has everything to gain
I see through you
I see through you
I see through you
Without doubt
Without prejudice & shame
I see through you
He who has nothing
Has everything to gain
I see through you
