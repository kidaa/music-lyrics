When I look at you
Oh, I dont know what I feel
Once in a while
And you make me laugh
And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
When you walk away
When you say ";I do";
Oh, but I don't believe in you
I can't forget it
No...oooh
When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile
When you turn your long blonde hair
