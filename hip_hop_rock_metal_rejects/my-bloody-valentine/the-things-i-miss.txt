Ride the waves goodbye
Walk the silver sand
Come with me, walk with me
To another land
We could never be
Barely cannot see
Take my hand, I'll bring you there
A place we've never seen
But the touch of your kiss
Will leaves me in a mess
The things I miss
Now the stars will shine
Taste your melting smile
Floating down into my arms
Your lips are touching mine
Stars will comb your hair
We will always be
Together there forever more
Away from misery
But the touch of your hand
Will make me understand
The things I miss
Or the touch of your kiss
Leaves me in a mess
The things I miss
Or the touch of your hand
Will make me understand
The things I miss
