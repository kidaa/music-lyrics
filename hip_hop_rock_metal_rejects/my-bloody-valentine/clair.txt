See me
Climbing through the clouds
The world is changing, colours clash
Ohhhhhhh
See me
Climbing down the stairs
I cut you with a piece of glass
Ohhhhhhh Clair
Now I catch the shining sun
And i'm walking through the long wet grass
Ohhhhhhh
Tear up clothes you used to wear
And you act as if you just don't care
Ohhhhhhh, Clair
