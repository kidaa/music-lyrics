Yeah, can you get what you see
But you can't have what you can't
Hey, what's come down over me
It's the way you stood
'Cause things the way they are
I guess you might go real far
So feed me with your kiss
Oh, come lie down close to me
Do what you dare
Oh I don't care
I will get what I can see
I'll crawl over there
Spread me like a appeal to you
I do what I do I do what I will do
Crave, your kiss will set you free
I'll do what I should
