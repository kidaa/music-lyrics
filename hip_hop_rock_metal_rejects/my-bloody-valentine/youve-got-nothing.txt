Touch me in the morning
I will touch you in the night
Raining down inside my head
Unburden me with my life
It's the secret in my ear
I never thought you'd care
Cut my arms and bind your legs
Fluffed up in her hair
If you're wondering why
Look into my eyes
If you can understand
Take me by the ___
Come follow me
'Cause I've got something
__ __ __ __ and you've got nothing
Hey hey hey, I never loved you that way
No no no, something that I could say
Look at your eyes 'cause you said something
About how I feel __ __ it means nothing
Hey hey hey, something that you will say
No no no, never liked you that way
If you're wondering why
Look into my eyes
Does she not understand
Take me by the hand
