Soft as snow but warm inside
Penetrate you cannot hide
Feeling lost forever
Really need you
Feeling dark and feeling true
This is all I ever knew
Soft as skin in leather
And I whisper 'you'
Harder you come down on me
Sink away you look happily
Secrets keep forever
They're undressing me
Come inside it's warm in here
Better now to have no fear
Carried on a wave
Where it can lead you
Touch your head, then your hair
Softer, softer everywhere
Fingertips are burning
Can I touch you there
Soft as velvet eyes can see
Bring me close to ecstacy
High away to heaven
And I'm coming too
Float now coming down on me
Handed you what I cannot see
Feel the big happy, you're exploding me
Soft as snow and warm inside
Penetrate then redivide
Slip away forever
Do we need you
