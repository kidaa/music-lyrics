Did you think I'd remember everything I'd say
How could I realise it would turn out this way
But you think you had it all
Things turn around and you're heading for a fall
Do you want me to tell you that I still love you?
Realise I can say things that you want me to
Oh your love is on the line
The world goes crazy and you cannot go on
I see the light in your eyes
Turning everything in your hair
I feel the cold deep inside
The cold comes out in insults
We'll fall apart again
Just like I don't know when
Never bothered to phone
You're safe in your sleep 
from this girl
