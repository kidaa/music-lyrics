Faces in the sand
Let me take you by the hand
Where do you come from
From a strange and secret land
Dark and scary eyes
And you feel you're always this way
Take me by the hand
Let me show you games we can play
Take me by suprise
Hide nothing from the shadows
We can kiss the sky
Never say goodbye
As we chase the clouds away
Pictures in the air
Would you let me take you there
Hold me, I will fall
And I'll show you how much I care
Paint your silver smile
Show you things that won't be sad
Let me take you there
And I'll show you what fun can be
