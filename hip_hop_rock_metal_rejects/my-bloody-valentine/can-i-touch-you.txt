You can sit up
And look out at the sky
Still, you're out on your own at night
I can hear you, I can hear you
And the make up
Is going to go along
The things we have done that are wrong
Can I touch you, can I touch you
Look into your eyes
I never ever wondered why
I need you to blame
I feel, I can feel the same
Look into my eyes
I bet you never thought that I'd feel
Things I thought I'd take
Were not there that way
And we sit up
And look out at the sky
The year as we wished flew bye
Can I touch you, can I touch you
