Misty morning in the springtime
Close your eyes, crystal eyes
On the darkside let the light shine
Please, please stay with me tonight
These lips will find strawberry wine
I was looking at your window
Lurking there beneath my feet
Cherry apples, long grass meadows
Searching I, for dreams in sleep
These lips will find strawberry wine
Misty morning in the springtime
Lurking there beneath your feet
On the darkside let the light shine
Think of me, don't let me keep
These lips will find strawberry wine
