Hands play shadows and the years unfold
Not your lover's coat
Seeing the girls for the first time out in this cold
Send me a promise wouldn't it be nice
All alone not with a girl
Holding me now for the first time is never enough
Sweet black sugar on a licked up sky
I'm gonna go out of my mind
Found this love for you alone
Close my eyes and letting it go
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She loves you no less but you do really care
Hands play down to take a look at your face
There's a daisy in her hair
Treachery is good it's the price to pay and stare
Sweet black sugar on a licked up sky
I'm gonna go out of my mind
Look around for a midnight feel
When I see you then I won't sleep
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She loves you no less but you do really care
