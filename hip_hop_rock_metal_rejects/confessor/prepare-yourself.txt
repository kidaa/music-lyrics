City sun goes down at night
Makin' way for Neon lights
Country boy is looking at the moon
City girl is dressed just right
She may stay out late tonight
Country boy just plowed today till noon
From Birmingham to Ohio
How the met nobody knows
Every now and then they get together
She used to wanna climb the walls
She'd never really been loved at all
Not until ol' country came to town
He's the first one too the room
Ice and drinks will be up soon
Everything is perfect when she walks in
They kiss and hold each other tight
They know what's in store tonight
Thery're not someplace they have never been
From Birmingham to Ohio
How the met nobody knows
Every now and then they get together
She used to wanna climb the walls
She'd never really been loved at all
Not until ol' country came to town
She used to wanna climb the walls
She'd never really been loved at all
Not until ol' country came to town
