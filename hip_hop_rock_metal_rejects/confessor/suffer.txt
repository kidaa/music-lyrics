I can see what you're looking to find in the smile on my face
In my peace of mind, in my state of grace
I send what I can to the man from the ministry
He's a part of heaven's plan and he talks to me

Now I send what I can to the man with the diamond ring
He's a part of heaven's plan and he sure can sing
Now it's all I can afford but the lord has sent me eternity
It's to save the little children in a poor country

I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
I got a ride all the way to paradise
I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
All the way to paradise

Now there's nothing left for luxuries
Nothing left to pay my heating bill
But the good lord will provide, I know he will
So send what you can to the man with the diamond ring
They're tuning in across the land to hear him sing

I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
I got a ride all the way to paradise
I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
All the way to paradise, all the way to paradise
