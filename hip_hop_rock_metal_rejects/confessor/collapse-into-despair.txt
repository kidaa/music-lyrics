I can't begin to tell you
How bad I feel about it
So now that it is all out
How do you feel - did you profit
Why can't you keep a secret
Why'd you squeal
I thought that I could trust you
Why'd you squeal

I thought we had agreed
That we were in this together
But now that you have betrayed me
I got no other option

Why can't you keep a secret
Why'd you squeal
I thought that it was private
It's a tea party and you're all invited
To kill the narc who wrote it and said it

You can always smell a stinkin' tattletale
Come out of a shell I think so they can break the link
When everyone knows it squeals and that is just as well
A kiss of death goes out to those who rat and fink
Why'd you squeal

But I can't begin to tell you
How bad I feel about it - hey

Why can't you keep a secret
Why'd you squeal
I thought that I could trust you
Why'd you squeal
It's a tea party and you're all invited
To kill the narc who wrote it and said it

You dirty rat

I can't begin to tell you
How bad I feel about it - hey
So now that it is all out
How do you feel - did you profit - hey

Well tell me all the gossip
Why'd you squeal
I hear the leaky faucet
It's a tea party and you're all invited
To kill the narc who wrote it and said it
Kill the narc who wrote it and said it
Who's the narc who wrote it and said it
