[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
Seasons come and seasons go 
Here I wait for something to be 
Try to get as much as I can see 
Hungry for life 
But Have you see the sands of time 
Every day is a moment in past 
Every heartbeat a step to my last 
I won't survive 
I don't know what time is made to be 
If it is a friend or enemy or does it only run 
Run to set and end 
Secrets of a crazy dream or just a bad 
Reality, I don't know 
Do you feel the sands of time 
Runnin' low to break the line 
First we learn to fly, then we learn to cry 
Later in the evening we will die 
Questions roamin' through my brain 
I'll be leavin' into a grave 
I'll be dead but my soul will be save 
For a time called forever 
All the seasons will have been gone 
There'll be times that you will forget 
My name and the words that I said 
Then my time will be over
