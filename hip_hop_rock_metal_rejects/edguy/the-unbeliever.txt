5:47
I am the madness carrying the torch,
lighting the wheat in your fields.
I am the eyes staring out of the dark,
I am the wear of your yields.
When you give response away I grow,
I am more of you then you might know.
Chorus
Burning down...burning down...
It's a story of deceivers.
Burning down...burning down...
Put the blame on the unbeliever!
I am the vision that comes to your mind
when you denounce without regret.
"God" is the word in the bible you say,
I am the word that you spread!
Repeat: Solo: Jens
I'm born and I lead the weak into the fire,
"no more pain" is what you claim
while you have found your wicked desire...
...hahaha...
