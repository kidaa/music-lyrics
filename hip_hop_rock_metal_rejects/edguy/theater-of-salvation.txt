12:25
"I've heard voices in my dream,
made me stand up, helped me see." aaah
oohhh...
Visions called him to awake his mind,
to find his horizon
and find out what may be behind.
Vision "take what you need,
you can find in the back of your soul!
Wake up the king in yourself
to be mighty and bold!"
Seasons of doubt,
fear and silent desires of life have gone by.
Visions have called back my longing
for freedom tonight, made me sigh...
Wasting my life till the day
that the voice as appeard...made me see:
"I am the one that can make it
through times of despair: I am free!"
They built up a symbol of warning,
to give me fear.
To keep me away from paradise
although it's so near.
Expecting I don't take a look
at what is behind: freedom calling...
Chorus
Take a look at the open gate!
Walk on and don't be afraid!
Free your mind in what they call,
it's the heart of temptation!
...Oh...go the way!
Take a look at the open gate!
Walk on and don't be afraid!
Free your mind in what they call,
it's the heart of temptation!
Night after night
I remember the words of the priest:
"thou shalt not! never give in to the promises made
by the beast, so help me god!
Never give in to the temptation or you'll burn in hell a
long, long time! Forever-eternal-salvation is what I
can sell if you stay blind!!!"
But I wanna know what lies behind the gate of their
hell, and I won't believe all the stories that they
always tell. I got the mind to find out what is right
and what's wrong, freedom calling...
Repeat: Solo: Both, Jens
Queen of mine I long for you,
tell me why to wait to find our joy!
It's your wait for heaven's door.
Your fear that makes them grow
and let  you forget today.
Solo: Jens
I'll never go and I'll stay on your side,
they'll never know what I give to you
is a piece of paradise.
Heaven can wait! now I'm living!
Heaven can wait forevermore.
Heaven can wait!
I am to live like I want to also before I'll die.
Heaven can wait! you can't thrill me!
Heaven can wait, we dance till we die!
Heaven can wait! welcome to the
Theater Of Salvation!
Solo: Jens
"Hallelujah, hallelujah"
I hear the man in black, his
"hallelujah, hallelujah"
He tries t okeep me back, no!
"hallelujah, hallelujah"
Lock up the gates to wisdom
"hallelujah, hallelujah"
too late! I've found the kingdom...
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
I see a band of angels.
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Freedom calling...
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
I do not fear the stories.
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
freedom calling me...
Solo: Both
Don't you see it? Don't you feel it?
Freedom calling...
