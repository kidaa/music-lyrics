[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet & Edguy]
Into a place of darkness. He was born to live alone 
He got one big desire. One day he`d get the crown 
Hey devil come on help me now 
Let me be your slave to serve you 
To let me be the king 
Just give me a sign 
Take on my mind and let me stay blind 
A victim of life too weak to be king 
Out of control - My life is a chamber of tears, fear and hate 
Out of control - Help me to gain the crown, here is my fate 
Wherever I may roam there will be hate and pain 
eye for eye, tooth for tooth. respect is what I gain 
I look up to Mr Crowley. evil powers now unite! 
I will be your darkest nightmare 
my life is a fatal fight 
Just give me a sign 
Take on my mind and let me stay blind 
A victim of life too weak to be king 
"listen up my friend you just cry for a hand 
but you only pretend that you`re bad. Now!" 
We`ll take on my mind
