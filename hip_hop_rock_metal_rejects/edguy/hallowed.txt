[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
Sacred  standing full of pride 
Spite in my brain causing you to fight 
Enchained  you pray to get a slave 
Rules with no sense, to dust you will decay 
You left the empire of freedom 
Hallowed be my name 
Hallowed be my name 
The god of creation you beg for damnation 
You think you can serve me with hate 
Hallowed be my name 
Hallowed be my name 
The god of creation you beg for damnation 
You think you can serve me with hate 
Hatred  pushed into the war 
Those who blaspheme just die by your sword 
Sacred - hallowed be my name 
For peace you destruct, a glorious crusade
