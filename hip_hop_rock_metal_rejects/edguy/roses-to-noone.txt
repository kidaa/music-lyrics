[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
I'm feeling this time as bad as never before 
A bleeding wag is fading away 
Once you needed me for spending delight 
Below the funny mask there's a crying face 
The way that I smile is the way that I cry 
But you'll never realize 
My reputation is the one of a fool 
Now watch like a poet dies, feel his cries 
And I dedicate my roses to noone 
Cause there is no mind to help me to see 
A reason we need, a light for the lonesome 
And noone to drink the blood that I bleed 
The poet in my own wasn't given some 
Chances and from that moment on 
I lived apart, and I realized that I am my 
Best friend and not those parasites 
That try to stare into my heart 
The way that I feel is the way that I heal 
My body and soul and my life 
And I know you just think I'm a fool 
New watch like a poet flies, watch him rise
