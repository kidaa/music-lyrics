Longing for silence...
"always faster" is the way that we go.
Not a little patience...
higher, farer, better we grow.
The beast is rising, it's tantalizing
those who are taking the time.
Alienation...a revelation...
straight to the end of the line...
The cold chill you feel is no dream it's for real.
We don't follow!
Chorus
Fly! Riding away...rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye.
Fly! Riding away...rising today...
No we don't play your headless game!
We are alive, don't say goodbye.
Lead-fill: Jens & Dirk
Cast out from eden...
you don't like what we are in your eyes.
We're leading the treason on the race you run,
the way of your life.
I am danger, I'm a stranger
cause I don't give in to your call,
and not until she is satisfied
we can come and explode and we fall!!!
We're blowing the frame of  your headless game:
We don't follow!
Repeat: solo: Jens: Repeat
