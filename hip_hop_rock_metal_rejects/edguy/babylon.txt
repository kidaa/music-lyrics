Yeah...
In a world of hate pollution
we can't breathe anymore.
We've to leave and this you,
the pawn, have won.
On our quest for nowhere island
we set off to the sea.
You call surrender what we call
a calm before the storm...
Pounding thoughts of home they make me know:
"I will return! I don't live my life for you.
It's too short to get burned.
Stand upright and face the wind!"
Chorus
Time to go back where I belong...
non one can prevent me from
raising towers in Babylon.
Time to go back where I belong...
no one can accuse me
for I do not fear Babylon, Babylon...
You only can love me if you can convert me
to attitudes of  your brain.
You blame us for doing things
that you don't know.
You tell me what you'd do if you were me.
But you are you and I am I lucky you.
But this time I say: "No!"
Pounding thoughts of home they make me know:
"I will return". I don't want to hurt you but you'll
have to learn: you are you and I am I!!!
Repeat: solo: jens: Both
ooohhh...
oh yeah...
