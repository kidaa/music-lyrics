[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet & Edguy]
Oh yeah...  
Watching a face and a smile and a light  
When you`re walking alone in the street  
I know your look always gives you the might  
Many miles from your ass to your feet  
And I dream- what I`ve seen  
Is what I want it to be - selfmade reality 
How many miles to the gate of reality  
How many steps left to go to my dreams  
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true 
Dreams which come true just have died  
Look like a queen but you talk like a pawn  
And I know you`re a fool in disguise  
Godfather tell me how to carry on  
Blinded by fantasies of lies  
And I dream- what I`ve seen  
Is what I want it to be - selfmade reality 
I see your smile, a golden masquerade  
And I know my dream will be my fate  
Time has stolen my fantasy  
Cause it has become a pale reality
