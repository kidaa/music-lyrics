[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
2080 -our world is an empty domain 
Emotions have died  
Men bleeding oil are the heroes for children today 
Drinking the blood of the weak dictators bring pain 
But they show us a smile 
Feelings and love are kept hidden in a madhouse cave 
It`s a mad revolution  
And the spirits will die  
Oh escape the confusion  
Take my hand.  
Now take my hand  
Take me now  
Take my hand  
We wont be so free 
Until we rise again!  
Eden is mad so enjoy it and fly to the sun 
Don`t you return  
Your breath and your heartbeat are gifts  
You`ve been given for life - oh yeah!  
Oh your deepest emotions 
are a sign of our life ad our love 
No robot can stop us  
Take my hand
