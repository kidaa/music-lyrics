[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
The prayers have been spoken 
may the gods be on my side 
may they join my way to bring me victory 
seven at one stroke 
my triumph and my pride 
will be history 
but behind my enemies eyes 
a soul in disguise 
not only lies 
We live to fight the hand of doom 
we got the pride to strike a fool 
vain glory be my wicked guide 
what`s hell without a paradise 
what`s the night without a day 
we would think it`s bright 
what`s a fall if we can`t rise 
what`s a hero at a play 
without a fool to fight 
but behind my enemies eyes 
a soul in disguise 
not only lies 
but behind my enemies eyes 
a soul in disguise 
not only lies
