[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet & Edguy]
The ivory is cold. Where is my desire 
In a cage of gold, not a trace of fire 
Ice cold as ice. I`m heading for tomorrow 
I am tired of waiting. I?l beg and steal and borrow 
Life is to short to be wasted 
So why do I sit around 
Dance on the edge of a razor 
Get off the ground and I`ll never return 
Walk on fighting 
Don`t look ever back 
Walk on fighting 
Don`t you look back to your cries 
The phone it waits in silence. No message left by you 
There is no use in crying. I know I`ve been a fool 
Now it is too late. No words left to say 
I gotta call it fate, forget and look away 
Life is to short to be wasted 
So why do I sit around 
Dance on the edge of a razor 
Get off the ground and I`ll never return 
Walk on fighting 
Don`t look ever back 
Walk on fighting 
Don`t you look back to your cries 
Walk on fighting...
