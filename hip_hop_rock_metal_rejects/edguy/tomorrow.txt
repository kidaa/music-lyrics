[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
Another day is coming 
a new day has begun 
An eagle is rising slowly to the skies of no return 
disappearing in the growing sun 
so proud and so beautiful 
thinking about tomorrow with tears in his eyes 
Once a lot of brothers spread their wings to join his way 
Now he`s left alone in a world of lies 
Cry for tomorrow 
Why don`t we hear the eagles cries 
Living in sorrow 
Why don`t we help him to survive 
Once a dignity- a mighty sign of pride 
Strong and proud and free 
A symbol of eternity. why don`t we see 
we can`t survive, if we don`t realize 
our world is a place that can`t be created twice
