[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
Nowhere yo run 
Nowhere to go  
Welcome to life damnation 
Welcome to fun 
Welcome to hope 
Here is your invitation 
Welcome to the gate 
To the unknown fate 
Waiting for a better day 
Jesters dance around 
Slowly growing old  
Having party while they stay 
Nowhere to run 
Nowhere to go 
Welcome to life damnation 
Welcome to fun  
Welcome to hope  
Here is your invitation
