[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet & Jens Ludwig]
Crying on the pyre, feelin' all so strange 
When you took my mind to deteriorate, told 
Me that you like me, atrocious and deterrent 
Lies, you showed me how it is to suffer hate 
Celebrate my funeral, vultures on my corpse 
Ashes to ashes  me to hell, you think I could 
Be dug alive, but you never knew, you're just 
Too deaf to hear my forces yell 
All your mind is full of hate, you hold the link 
To seal my fate, I stare into the light 
Now you'll try to burn me, inquisition in our 
Time, but I'll tell you what I am 
Burning like a frozen candle 
Burning like a frozen candle 
I can still remember when you called the reaper 
Told him how to unlock my door, sleepers 
Nights, evil dreams, faces in the window 
Voices that I've never heard before
