[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
A dawn on the run, nowhere to hide in a life of 
Corruption, insanity has won, I'm living in hate 
And preaching destruction 
I'm screaming tonight, my vengeance 
To fight has killed all morality 
The cries of the toll and madness control 
And liberate my energy  Axe to the wax ! 
Misguidin' your life, you'll reach 
The empire of sadness 
I will be rife, driven by insanity and hate 
Misguidin' your life, you'll reach 
The empire of sadness 
I will be rife, driven by insanity 
Lunacy and rage are raving in my head, reign 
Back to back, c'mon be my slave, the beauty 
In your face will be fading to black
