[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
Am I totally blind this time when I'm dreamin' 
The dreams that I fear, some call it nightmare 
And some call it life, what is the sense of 
Existing in here 
And I think of the sadness when I'm dreamin' of 
Leavin' the pain I don't get all that madness 
And it drives me insane 
Now hear me cry, I'm in quest 
Of the key to my fate 
I might be nigh to the key 
In the abyss of hate 
Annihilation in my brain 
What is the price that we will be to pay 
When will you lift our little poor souls 
When will you take us oh lord away 
Oh when will we die 
Why to suffer to stand up right 
We are victims of time 
We have to fight till the end is in sight 
What's the reason to carry on 
What's the reason to fall 
After days of living hall 
After we had to crawl, 
Are we totally blind this time 
Can't you tell me the nexus of freedom 
And pain and desires and hate 
And even the holy ones
