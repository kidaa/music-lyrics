[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet & Edguy]
Fair sex paralyzer. Lipstick in a face 
spirit analyzer, not one human trace 
no need to cry 
rool the fuckin` dice, im a loser in a game 
gonna hurt my feelings, your only real aim 
feels like I die 
You can play nice you get satisfied when you win 
I see a smile of truth but I can`t stare within 
riot in your soul 
No more foolin` 
you will save all your love 
no more foolin` 
you will save all your love 
Say goodbye- say goodbye 
you never knw that I was strong enough to stand 
All alone on my own I don`t need your hand 
Got your weapons loaded, your target in your sight 
why don`t you only tell me, that i shall fuckin` die 
Looking so attractive, wanna get me active 
but you never realized that i have got the tactics 
I`m much too cool, much too large to be fooled 
by your lies 
You can play nice you get satisfied when you win 
I see a smile of truth but I can`t stare within 
riot in your soul 
Say goodbye- say goodbye 
you never knw that I was strong enough to stand 
All alone on my own I don`t need your hand 
Say goodbye- say goodbye
