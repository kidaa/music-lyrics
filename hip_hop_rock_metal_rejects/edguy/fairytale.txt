[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet & Edguy]
yeah... 
giants of stone build up my desire 
no one could tell us the secret of fire 
the hinger for wisdom deep in your heart 
you can`t accept that you`re liveing apart 
water runs down through the river 
lord you are the only to deliver 
night: stay night 
in the night`s nothing is white 
now a knowledge not a light 
lord, will you tell me why someday 
fairytale - life is one big fairytale 
a book of seven seals 
someone tell me why and how 
I`m always told to kneel down and pray 
What shall I do to stay on my way 
Questions borrow through my brain 
pound and disturb and drive me insane 
Lost in visions of knowledge I`ll never owe 
night to night 
choir of the damned smurfs of death 
in the night`s nothing is white 
now a knowledge not a light 
lord, will you tell me why someday 
Tell me what is time - yeah
