[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
Ravens in the air, noone in the streets 
Seems like the fiend he must be back 
Riding on his horse but also flying in the iar 
Love has just started to crack - ow 
Whisplash and torture, falseness and pain 
Envy is driving our hate 
Everything out there is mad and confused 
Till we'll be able to seal each others fate 
Staring through eyes of hate and able to kill 
We don't realize we've been given our own 
Fuckin' will, like animals humans don't think 
Don't look for a reason, we hate no style 
We put the blame on the demon 
Sacred hell, sacred hell 
There is nothing but names on the wall 
You can be free, you can reach tomorrow 
Sacred hell, sacred hell 
So the fend must be back on our ball 
Lose all your sins, lose all your sorrows 
No lucid intervals, no people who guide 
But a 1000 Masters of disguise 
Eternal damnation 'cause humans they hide 
They think that satan shall rise
