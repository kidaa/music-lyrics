[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
In the eyes of the mighty domain and its evil 
Doctrines, there is no trace of romance 
But the fears that grow 
Noone can watch his next into the eyes 
You killed the poetry of mine 
A long time ago  NOW 
How many times have you given me rage 
When your words were mendacious 
And your laughter insane, how many times 
Have you written lapoons about my life 
And desires, about my pleasure and pain 
I bare my fangs to you, look at my face and 
You'll stare into my mind and you'll watch 
The eyes of the tyrant  eyes of the night 
The eyes of the tyrant  eyes of the night 
Back from the hades, into the daylight 
Back from the hades, into the daylight 
King of tonight, tell me what should I do 
Should I die in glory, should I raise my fist 
The Crime of my deads is the frolic I need 
I won't die on my knees, I will kill to resist 
The chagrin of the damned cries the tears of 
Romance, lord of uprightness take me now 
The empire of the sad, the empire of the mad 
My feelings were killed so long ago 
Yeah, we are eternal, we are immortal 
There is a trace of glory in our hands 
Majestic and wild, we stand and we fight 
Soon your blackened pride will be fading away 
You'll realize you'll had been walking astray 
Never tame the wicked, I'm a tyrant tonight 
Back from the hades, into the light 
Back from the hades into 
Uh, now here we go
