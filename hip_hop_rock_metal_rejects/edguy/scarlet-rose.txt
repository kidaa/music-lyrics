[music & lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
The moment when you held me tight 
won`t come back any more 
And at the end of that night 
you slammed the door 
My dream it died away  
just when I saw red 
And nothing but a memory 
is left inside my head 
Nothing is forever in life  
But a memory believe it`s true  
And when I gaze in the rain 
i`m crying just for you 
The scarlet rose has died  
Lost inside the night 
Left in my mind like a dream and full of pride  
The scarlet rose has died 
The one and only way to catch the 
beauty of a dawn  
Is to take a picture  
of the growing sun 
I got that experience  
no one could steal away  
One moment of your life is mine 
I remember day by day 
Nothing is forever in life  
But a memory believe it`s true  
And when I gaze in the rain 
i`m crying just for you
