I saw your mama and she said don't call you
Talked to your best friend and she said no need to
But I had to tell you I hate how I hurt you
Now I know how bad I hurt me too

If I've gotta get down on my knees tonight I'll do it
If you want to see me cry then baby, let's get to it
If I've gotta beg and plead
To make you see I need you in my life
Well, love is stronger than pride

I've got no right to ask you to forgive me
But I've got no choice 'cause it's about to kill me
I've been headstrong and I was dead wrong
And one minute more without you's just too longIf I've gotta get down on my knees tonight I'll do it
If you want to see me cry then baby, let's get to it
If I've gotta beg and plead
To make you see I need you in my life
Well love is stronger than pride

If I've gotta beg and plead
To make you see I need you in my life
Well love is stronger than pride
If I've gotta beg and plead
To make you see I need you in my life
Well love is stronger My love is stronger
Love is stronger than pride
