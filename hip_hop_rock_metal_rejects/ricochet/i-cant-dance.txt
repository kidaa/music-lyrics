She don't have to fake it
That girl was born to shake it
Stompin' on the hardwood floor
Like she's gonna break it
She's the main attraction
How can I get in on the action
Well there's only one way to get next to her
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

I'm a roper and rider
I'm a lover and a fighter
I'm a mud-slingin' son-of-a-gun
And a 4-wheel driver
But tonight I'm confessin'
I might need her to give me a lesson
Say baby can you teach these old boots to burn
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
Takin' my number and waitin' my turn
Cowboy's comin' from miles around
Just to be her partner when the two-step comes around

Honey, please won't you show me
I might fall, baby, you'd better hold me
Yeah, bein' out here takes a lotta nerve
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn

I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
Takin' my number and waitin' my turn
Cowboy's comin' from miles around
Just to be her partner when the two-step comes around

It might take me forever
But I'll follow you 'til I get better
We can go all night as far as I'm concerned
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
Baby can you teach these old boots to burn
I can't, I can't, I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
I can't dance, but I'm willin' to learn
