Sunny Russ/Cathy MajeskiTrack 2 - Time 3:34
Hey I've been around I've seen it all
Love is a chain around your heart
That holds you down
You're better off runnin' away before it starts
I wanted to chase my dreams
I thought freedom meant everything but

Hey, hey what do I know
I'm just a lonely fool that let you go
And now what do I do
Thought I could live without you but
What do I know

Look who I've become I wanted it all
Oh but it hasn't happened yet
Look what I've done I've built a wall
In between me and happiness
I had the answers I made the rules
And I thought I had nothing to lose butHey, hey what do I know
I'm just a lonely fool that let you go
And now what do I do
Thought I could live without you but
What do I know

I had the answers I made the rules
And I thought I had nothing to lose but

Hey, hey what do I know
I'm just a lonely fool that let you go
And now what do I do
Thought I could live without you without you but
What do I know
But what do I know
