Move on closer, near by my side
let me take you for a while
did what I had to, but it's still a long way
hope you'll remember me
each n' every day

Out on this long trail
back on dusty roads, ridin' slow
through the darkest of the nights, alone

I'm on my way,
I'm on my way,
I'm on my way, and I'll be there one day
yeah, yeah

Another evening, I'm still in bed
wheels are turning round n' round
dancing with shadows,
talking in the sleep
while the miles are passing away

lights in the window
lights in my head, riding slow
on the highway once again

I'm on my way,
I'm on my way,
I'm on my way, I got one place to stay

The place is getting empty
roadies take the stage
the first to come, the last to go
still wanna sing, still wanna play
before I leave it all behind
move on closer, near by my side
let me take you for a while ....
did what I had to, but it's still a long way
hope you'll remember me
each n' every day
