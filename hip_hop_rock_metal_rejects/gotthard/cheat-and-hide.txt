LOOKING BACK I WONDER
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEING LYING TO ME
GUESS, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY
I'LL NEVER SOLVE THE MISTERY

OUR LIFE IS A GAME
A GAME WE PLAY
WHICH RULES I'VE NEVER SEEN
AND DAY AFTER DAY
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
MAKES ME WANNA SCREAM

I DON'T WANNA DIE
FOR A WOMAN LIKE YOU NO MORE
I HAD IT ALL BEFORE
I WILL TAKE IT NO MORE
GOTTA STOP THIS CHEAT 'N HIDE

WHO SAID WE'RE IN FOR TROUBLE
ALL I KNOW HE SURE WAS RIGHT
WE START A NIGHT IN HEAVEN, AND
WE END IT IN A FIGHT

OUR LIFE IS A GAME
A GAME WE PLAY
THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL
BUT LADY LUCK IS BLINDFOLD
YOUR BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL

I DON'T WANNA DIE
FOR A WOMAN LIKE YOU NO MORE
I HAD IT ALL BEFORE
I WILL TAKE IT NO MORE
GOTTA STOP THIS CHEAT N'HIDE

I DON'T WANNA DIE
FOR A WOMAN LIKE YOU NO MORE
I HAD IT ALL BEFORE
I WILL TAKE IT NO MORE
GOTTA STOP THIS CHEAT N'HIDE

NO I DON'T WANNA DIE , NO MORE
