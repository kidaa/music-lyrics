Baby, is it right to fantasize 
I said lady, i can't get this out of my mind 
yes i'm smoking i'm burning 
i'm twisting i'm turning 
got to give a lot of love 
woman i'm learning 
baby, you let me run all night 
and i can't stand it no more 

I get down, i get down, on my knees 
and you know, yes you know, 
how it feels 

I'm walking in the streets 
and nobody cares for me 
they keep on telling me 
nothing in this world's for free 
my heart is on fire, right out of space 
such a killer body, with a little girl's face 
lady, is if right to fantasize..... oh yeah! 

I get down, i get down, on my knees 
and you know, yes you know, 
how to tease, baby..... 

let's rock tonight 

I get down, i get down, on my knees 
and you know, yes you know 
how to tease....
