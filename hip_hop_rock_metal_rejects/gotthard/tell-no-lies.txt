LORD ABOVE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO THIS LONELY HEART O'MAN
FRIGHTENED TO THE BONE
THAT'S HOW IT ALL BEGAN
HE BOUGHT A COLT, A 38
TO GAIN SECURITY
HE'D ONLY HAVE ONE MISSION
PROTECT THE FAMILY

HIS SON IS ONLY 13
AND... HE'S PLAYING "JUDGMENT DAY
ALIKE THE LATE NIGHT MOVIE
BLOWS SOMEONES HEAD AWAY
DADDY TOLD HIM HOW TO LOAD
AND PULL THE TRIGGER NOW
THEN LEFT HIM ON IT'S ROAD AGAIN
FOR MORE RESPECT IN TOWN

DON'T TELL NO LIES
LIKE YOU USE TO DO
DON'T TELL NO LIES
WE'RE NOT SAVE ANYMORE
WE NEED UNDERSTANDING
RESPECT, AND HELP US GOD
SO DON'T TELL NO LIES...... NO MORE

 WON'T SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
SPREADING SEEDS OF HATE
GROWING ONLY FEAR
IT'S A RACE AGAINST THE TIME
THE MANY THINGS UNDONE
STILL WE LOOK AT JUSTICE
TROUGH THE BARREL OF A GUN

THERE MUST BE AN ANSWER TO THIS EVERLASTING "WHY
IT'S GETTING HARDER EVERYDAY, NO MATTER HOW I TRY
