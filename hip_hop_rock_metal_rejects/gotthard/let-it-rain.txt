LADY JANE
WILL WE EVER MEET AGAIN
THE TIMES WE HAD, I COUNT 'EM DAY BY DAY
ALL THE PAIN.... THAT WE GAVE EACH OTHER THEN
WAS NOT ENOUGH TO WANNA MAKE US RUN

WHO DID SAY THIS LIFE WILL LAST FOREVER
WE'RE STANDING AT THE CROSSROAD ONCE AGAIN
ALL THE THINGS IN LIFE ARE GROWING SLOWLY IN PROGRESS
I KNOW, WE GOT TO LISTEN TO THE FLOW

LET IT RAIN, LET IT RAIN
TILL THE SUN COMES BACK AGAIN
THE ANSWER IS YOUR ONLY FRIEND

WE WALK THIS PATH, SLOWLY STEP BY STEP
WE DON'T HAVE TO FORCE IT, JUST BELIEVE
THERE'S A PLACE DEEP INSIDE
WHERE WE'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE
I KNOW WE CAN BE THERE, YOU 'N ME

WHO DID SAY THIS LIFE WILL LAST FOREVER
WE'RE STANDING AT THE CROSSROAD ONCE AGAIN
ALL THE THINGS IN LIFE ARE FADING SLOWLY IN PROGRESS
I KNOW, WE GOT TO LISTEN TO THE FLOW

LET IT RAIN, LET IT RAIN
TILL THE SUN COMES BACK AGAIN
THE ANSWER IS YOUR ONLY FRIEND
LET IT RAIN, LET IT RAIN
CUZ I KNOW WE'LL MEET AGAIN
FREEDOM WILL BE THERE IN THE END

HOPE YOU FIND YOUR PARADISE
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST OF TIMES
HAVE FAITH IN LOVE AND PLEASE DON'T CRY

LET IT RAIN, LET IT RAIN
TILL THE SUN COMES BACK AGAIN
THE ANSWER, IS YOUR ONLY FRIEND
LET IT RAIN, LET IT RAIN
CUZ I KNOW WE'LL MEET AGAIN
FREEDOM WILL BE THERE IN THE END
