No I can't stand another minute 
Wanna beat it 
It's quite a sacrifice so hard to realize 
I see you cryin', you keep on tryin' 
But I don't wanna play the fool again 

You're talking, talking, but I don't care 
Don't mess with my mind, don't even dare 
I hear you knockin', night and day, I tell you 
It's not an' easy game you play 

You should know that it's over 
Baby, you miss the train 
Baby, hear what I, say 

No lonely heartaches, don't want what you got 
I'm on a star chase, see ya! like it or not 

Don't try to make me feel so guilty 
Cuz girl you blew it 
You played a foolish game 
So now you pay the price 
Just know you're lucky 
Don't you deny it 
Cuz you can walk away 
I let you walk away-.. 

You should know that it's over 
Baby, you miss the train 
Baby, hear what I say 

No lonely heartaches 
Don't want what you got 
I'm on a star chase, see ya! like it or not 

No lonely heartaches 
Don't want what you got 
I'm on a starchase, and baby I want it hot 
No more
