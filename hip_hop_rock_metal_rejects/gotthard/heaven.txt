Show me the way to your heart 
I am searching 
But Im drifting apart 

Everythings gone far away 
Here were standing now 
With no words left to say 

Gave you power 
Fell on the floor 
Silence, never thought you hurt so bad 
In darkest hours 
Slept at your door 
Wishing all would be just like before 

Let me find my piece of Heaven 
Let me find my way- back home 
I want this love to last forever 
And back together, rise once again 
From the ashes to the Sky 

Has someone taken my place 
Am I falling 
Was it our last embrace 

Now youre asking me for some more time 
I am trying to survive 
Victim of my desire 

I keep on running 
Im up all night 
Times, I never thought they hurt so bad 
In darkest hours 
Stand by your door 
Wishing all would be just like before!
