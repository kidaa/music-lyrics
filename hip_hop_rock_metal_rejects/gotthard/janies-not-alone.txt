Hard times, shadow of a street light , dark eyes, stealing to survive 
God knows, with a pocket full of hope she goes 
Young life, closing all around her, shell be twelve, somewhere round
June 
No chance, for a child growing up too soon 

And she never felt love from someone, never had love before 
Just another cry of desperation, that no one stands up for 
Janies not alone 
Shes not the only one, who lives a life in misery 
Janies not alone 
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny 
No mother, no father, she calls for angels, but the angels cry 
No chance, I guess that she was born to loose 
yeah. 

And she never felt love from someone, never had love before 
Can we ever stop the tears from falling, so she wont cry no more 
Janies not alone 
Shes not the only one, who lives a life in misery 
Janies on her own 
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny 

And she never felt love from someone, oh never had love before 
Just another cry of desperation, that no one stands up for 
Janies not alone 
Shes not the only one, who lives a life in misery 
Janies not alone 
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny 
Janies not alone 
But she keeps holding on, its not how it was meant to be 
Janies on her own 
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny 
Janies not alone 
Janies not alone
