Been almost a thousand years, 
since I startet killing time 
Every day reminds me how I feel 
Couldn't face the ending 
so I left it undefined 
I was wrong, I was wrong 
Now there's nothing I can do 
Cause still i belong to you 

Took a train to nowhere 
Now I start the long road back 
Look for signs but no real place to go 
I'll find someone to take me where you're completely out of view 
Lay it down, lay it down 
I try to be strong, but still I belong to you 

If we had the chance to take it 
Could we find the way to make things right 
Did I mean that much to you 
Gotta face the dream is over 
That's just the way the story goes 
And I can't believe it`s true 
that still I belong 
still I belong to you 

Been almost thousand years 
since I started killing time 
in and out of love, I thought was real 
I was wrong, I was wrong 
now there's so much more 
that i could give to you 

If we had the chance..... 


To you...I try to be strong 
But still I belong 
to you to you to you to you to you
