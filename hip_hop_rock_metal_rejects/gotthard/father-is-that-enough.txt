You came into my life,... Boy 
I didn't found the words to 
let you know 
we were like strangers, 
heaven knows 
with a many ways to go 

But it's over now, 
right before we started 
It's all over now, 
it's weather blown away 

No, you don't need to sacrifice 
nor hide the risin' sun 
made a million, got it all 
father, is that enough ? 

Remember i was lonely 
I was nowhere 
Couldn't stand the pain i wore 
And yeah, i keep learning 
Live is livin' 
so much more than words can say 
But it's over now, 
no gambling with my soul 
It's all over now 
I found my way to go
