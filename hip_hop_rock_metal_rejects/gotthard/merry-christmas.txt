NO ONE HERE, NO ONE THERE I SEE DESOLATION EVERYWHERE
JUST RUN OUT OF TEARS TO CRY

ITS GETTING COLDER EVERY DAY
IN THIS GOD FORGOTTEN WORLD I PRAY
AS I LOOK UP TO THE SKY

IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO?
TO GIVE BACK HOPE TO THIS HORIZON
CLOSE MY EYES, AS IF IT WOULD STOP THE RAIN
ON ME.
I CAN'T GET MY FEARS AWAY
WITH THOSE WORDS I HEAR YOU SAY

WISH YOU ALL A MERRY CHRISTMAS
WISH YOU ALL A GREAT NEW YEAR
HOPE YOU SAVE A THOUGHT FOR SOMETHING
THAT IS TRUE
I WISH A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU!

GREETING CARDS, THAT YOU READ
YOU GOT EVERYTHING YOU REALLY NEED
IN YOUR WORLD OF RED N'WHITE

FLYING HIGH RIGHT TO THE SUN
BUT THE SPARKLE IN YOUR EYES HAS GONE
IT'S SO EASY TO FORGET

IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO? IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO?
I DON'T WANNA WEEP IN SILENCE  I DON'T WANNA WEEP IN SILENCE
THERE'S NO SUCH BLINDMAN
WHEN YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE
BUT I CAN'T EASE MY PAIN TODAY
WITH THE WORDS I HEAR YOU SAY

WISH YOU ALL A MERRY CHRISTMAS
WISH YOU ALL A GREAT NEW YEAR
HOPE YOU SAVE A THOUGHT FOR SOMETHING
THAT IS TRUE
I WISH A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU!
