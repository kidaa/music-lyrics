BLACKBERRY WAY
ABSOLUTELY POURING DOWN WITH RAIN
IT'S A TERRIBLE DAY
UP WITH THE LARK
SILLY GIRL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
SHE WAS RUNNING AWAY

SO NOW I'M STANDING ON THE CORNER
LOST IN THE THINGS THAT I SAID
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW

GOODBYE BLACKBERRY WAY
I CAN'T SEE YOU
I DON'T NEED YOU
GOODBYE BLACKBERRY WAY
SURE TO WANT ME BACK ANOTHER DAY

DOWN TO THE PARK
OVERGROWING BUT THE TREES ARE BARE
THERE'S A MEMORY THERE
BOATS ON THE LAKE
UNATTENDED NOW THE LAUGHTER DROWNED
I'M INCREDIBLY DOWN
JUST LIKE MYSELF THEY ARE NEGLECTED
TURN WITH MY EYES TO THE WALL
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW

GOODBYE BLACKBERRY WAY
I CAN'T SEE YOU
I DON'T NEED YOU
GOODBYE BLACKBERRY WAY
SURE TO WANT ME BACK ANOTHER DAY

SO FULL OF EMPTINESS WITHOUT HER
LOST IN THE WORDS THAT I SAID
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW
