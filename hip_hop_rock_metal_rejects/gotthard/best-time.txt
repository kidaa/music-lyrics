TELL ME HOW LONG
WHEN IT'S GONNA END
TIME AND AGAIN
THESE ARE THE WORDS I UNDERSTAND
LIVIN' WITH ME 
MUST HAVE BEEN A SACRIFICE
BUT IT'S EASY TO PRETEND
TO BE SOMEONES HELPING HAND, YEAH

NOW THAT YOU TURN
ON YOUR WAY TO BE FREE
BABY, STARS ARE FALLIN' DOWN
NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE
YOU MEAN A WHOLE WORLD TO ME
BABY, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAY

WE'VE GOT OUR BEST TIME TOGETHER
AND NOW YOU WALK OUT FROM ME
THOUGH WE CAN'T GO ON FOREVER, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE IN MY HEART

YOU SAID IT WAS ME
WITH BROKEN PROMISES
THAT KEPT YOU FROM LIVIN'
AND HERE I MUST CONFESS
THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE
THE COLOURS FADE AWAY
AND I START TO REALIZE
THAT'S THE PRICE I HAVE TO PAY

NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE
YOU MEAN A WHOLE WOLD TO ME
BABY, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAY

WE'VE GOT OUR BEST TIME TOGETHER
AND NOW YOU WALK OUT FROM ME
THOUGH WE CAN'T GO ON FOREVER, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE IN MY HEART

.....OOOOHHHH......

WE'VE GOT OUR BEST TIME TOGETHER
AND NOW YOU WALK OUT FROM ME
THOUGH WE CAN'T GO ON FOREVER, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE IN MY HEART
