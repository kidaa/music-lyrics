Hello, hello, hello 
Is there anybody listening in the crowd 
Don't think twice 
Ain't gonna waste no more time 

The clock's running 
and I see the end of the line 
It's calling so watch me leave 'em all behind 

You can turn me loose you can call my name 
I'll keep climbing higher 
I will touch the sky as the eagle flies 
On my way to be there 
Right on top of the world 

Hello, hello, hello 
Now I'm rolling like a freight train down the track 
Don't look back, don't try to get in my way 

Oh, I'm coming 
well I've got my eye on the flame 
And I'm running, cause I was born to play the game 

You can turn me loose... 

It's not an illusion 
This is my one desire 
There's no confusion 
Well I can set the world on fire 

You can turn me loose... 

I'm on fire 

On my way to be there 
Right on top of the world
