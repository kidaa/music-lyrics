Trying to hide from every shadow 
Scared from every noise that's comin' through 
Got a 24 hour run 
You know, I'm still around 
Hunting you 

Bad places, dark faces 
Keep on runnin' for your life 

Cause I'm the hunter 
I'm the hunter 
I'm the hunter an eagle in the sky 
I'm the hunter 
I'm the hunter 
I'm the hunter nowhere you can hide 
Nowhere you can hide 

Don't try to answer the phone 
Beware of any stranger at your door 
There's no way to imagine 
Where it's coming from 
Better hit the floor, yeah!
