I bought a ticket for the late night plane 
I took my notebook, walked out in the rain 
I said, I'm leaving, wanna know what makes 
the world go round 

A password leads me to my promised land 
Hot information, in the palm of my hand. 
I said I'm surfing ' honey 
sorry if I let you down 

She said, 
Hurry, you gonna get a heartache 
I said, I'm comin, it's gonna be alright

I'm talking' "windows, scanners and screens" 
I'm getting' hot about those virtual dreams 
I said I'm sorry honey 
I just can't get out this time..no, no 

And my little girl said... 

Hurry...
