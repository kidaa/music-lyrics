SO YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW 
ALL YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU HONEY 
THERE'S YOUR NAME ON THE WALL 
AND IT AIN'T THAT FUNNY 

GUESS YOU'RE OUT ON THE STREET 
SHAKIN' LEGS EVERY NIGHT 
AND THE WHOLE WORLD'S LOOKING AT YOU 
KINDA LOVE AT FIRST BITE 

AND THE SAME OLD SONG 
I HEAR YOU PLAY 


ON AND ON , AGAIN 
YOU GOTTA MAKE MY DAY 

YEAH, YOU DRANK ALL MY WINE 
N' YOU GAVE ALL MY MONEY AWAY 
NO MORE GAS IN THE CAR 
AND YOUR DOG WANTS ME TO STAY 
DARLING, YOU KNOW, YOU GO A LITTLE TOO FAR 
BUT I'M SURE NOT A PAWN ON YOUR CHESSBOARD 
BABY, NO MORE 

AND THE SAME OLD SONG 
I HEAR YOU PLAY 

ON AND ON , AGAIN 
GOTTA MAKE MY DAY 

WELL, YOU TAKE IT ALL FOR GRANTED 
YOU GOT ME HYPNOTISED 
SO WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, HONEY 
I WANT YOU TO MAKE MY DAY 

DON`T NEED NO PRETTY LIES 
READ MY LIPS 
MAKE MY DAY
