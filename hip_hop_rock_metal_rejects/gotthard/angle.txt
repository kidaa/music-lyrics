I need a woman, that holds on 
that gives me time to think it over 
time for movin' on 
thats all i want, right now, by me 

I wanna meet a real heart, a true one 
too many words, too many lies 
bring confusion in my mind 
i gotta break out 
cause i can't stand it anymore, no more 

More that i want, more that i need 
more that i want, more that i bleed 
can anybody find me an 

Angel , angel, im crying out for you tonight 
oh angel, are you there or in my mind 
i want you to believe me, please take me there 

Sometimes i dream, and i wish to have 
a little hand to carry me 
far away from what i see 
if i only could have you, right now, by me 

I wanna face a real world, a true one 
too many words, too many lies 
bring confusions in my mind 
i gotta break out 
cause i can't stand it anymore, no more 

More that i want, more that i need 
more that i want, more that i bleed 
can anybody find me an 

Angel, angel, i'm crying out for you tonight 
oh angel, are you there or in my mind 
i want you to believe me, right now 

Angel on my mind, oh 
you're so hard to find
