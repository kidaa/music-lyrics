What I like 
Is to take the highest road that never ends 
To hold the moment right here in my hands 
Yeah, that's what I like - to feel alive 

What I like 
Is to know your body's lying next to mine 
To see you smile without a reason why 
Yeah, that's what I like - that's what I like 

It's something that will never end 

Soul to soul 
Everything here is all over control 
Eye to eye 
Can you see it 
Can you feel it 
What I like 

What I like 
Is to take you on a journey 'round the sun 
I wonder if you'd like to come along 
Yeah, well may be tonight - may be tonight 

It's something that will never end 

Soul to soul 
Everything here is all over control 
Eye to eye 
Let me show you 
All I've told you 

Yeah 

It's something that will never end 
And when it's right you'll understand 

Soul to soul 
Everything here is all under control 
Eye to eye 
Can you see it 
Can you feel it 
What I like 

What I like 
What I like 
What I like 
What I like...
