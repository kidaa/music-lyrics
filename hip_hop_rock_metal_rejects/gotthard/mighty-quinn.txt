Everybody's building the big ships and boats
Some are building monuments // others jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair // every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here // everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!
See nothing at all

I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But guarding fumes and making haste // it ain't my cup of meat
Everybody's 'neath the trees // feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here // all the pigeons gonna run to him
Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!

Instrumental
Oh, Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty
Quinn!
Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within - You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn!
See nothing at all, like the Mighty Quinn, You'll not see nothing like the Mighty
Quinn
