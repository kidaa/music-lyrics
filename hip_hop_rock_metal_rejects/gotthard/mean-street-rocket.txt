I get up, I get down 
Bad luck, for those who mess around 
The streets of fire 

Look out, he's around 
Can you feel the shakin' ground 
He's ridin' again 
The streets of fire 

No time for compromise at all 
Thunder, lightning, here it comes again 

This is the mean street rocket 
This is the mean street rocket 
This is the mean street rocket I like, yeah I like! 

It's going hot, everywhere 
Gasoline's in the air 
He's going to light up 
The streets of fire
