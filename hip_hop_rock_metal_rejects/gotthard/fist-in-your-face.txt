YOU PUSHED IT TO THE LIMIT 
NOW YOU GOTTA CHOOSE TONIGHT 
TAROT WOMAN, YOU'RE ALL ABOUT TO LOOSE THE FIGHT 
DON'T NEED A PART TIME WIZARD 
WHO DRIVES ME OUTTA MY MIND 
CUZ' I'M ALLRIGHT 
I GONNA LIVE IT UP TONIGHT 

ONCE UPON A TIME, 
THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS MINE ALONE 
HAD NO TIME TO REALIZE, 
IT CAME WITHOUT A WARNING AT ALL 

LIKE A FIST IN YOUR FACE 
A FIST IN YOUR FACE 

AND THERE'S A TIME BOMB TICKIN' 
DEEP INSIDE MY HEAD 
MUST BE A BLACK HOLE ATTRACTION 
A WRONG STEP N' YOU'RE DEAD 
DON'T KNOW THE WORD SURRENDER 
DON'T KNOW THE RULES OF THE GAME 
I'M READY TO GO AND I SWEAR 
YOU WON'T FORGET MY NAME
