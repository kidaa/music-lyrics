CARRY ALL THE WEIGHT UPON YOUR SHOULDERS
IT'S ANOTHER DAY IN YOUR FRANTIC LIFE
YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER VOICE IN THE CROWD
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

NOTHING'S EVER WHAT IT SEEMS
THEY SELL YOU WRONG FOR RIGHT
ALL YOU REALLY NEED ...
SOME PEACE OF MIND, YEAH

MEANWHILE ALL GO MAD AROUND YOU
MORE AND MORE UNSATISFIED
IN THE RACE FOR PROGRESS
WE'VE SPUN OUT OF CONTROL
DON'T YOU THINK THIS ALL
HAS GONE TOO FAR....

BUT LIFE IS PRECIOUS
A GIFT WE  SHOULDN'T WASTE
GO AND GET YOURSELF
SOME PEACE OF MIND

NOTHING'S EVER WHAT IT SEEMS
THEY SELL YOU BLACK FOR WHITE
AND THE WORLD IS UPSIDE DOWN

BUT LIVE IS PRECIOUS
A GIFT WE  SHOULDN'T WASTE
SOMEBODY HELP ME FIND
MY PEACE OF MIND
