Look at them all on the inside 
Look at them wasting away 
Walking around like they're hypnotized 
Look, no bars on the cage 

This is where they're living 
Same as where they'll die 
Nothing lasts forever 
Can someone draw the line 

Do we ever know the reason 
Of what lies behind that smile 
Take a seat, enjoy the journey 
Just relax I'll lead you through 
Through the human zoo 

Well, I hear 'em cry in the daylight 
I hear 'em scream after dark 
A real life jungle atmosphere 
Watch 'em tear each other apart 

Cause this is where they're living 
Same as where they'll die 
Stop it now or never 
Can someone draw the line 

Do we ever know the reason 
Of what lies behind that smile 
Take a seat enjoy the journey 
Just relax I'll lead you through 
Through the human zoo
