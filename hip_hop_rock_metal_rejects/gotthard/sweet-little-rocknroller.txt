I DON' T KNOW WHERE YOU CAME FROM 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GO 
YOU GIMME SO MUCH TROUBLE 
YOU GIMME SO MUCH FUN 

YOU SAY I MUST BE CRAZY 
BUT SOMETIMES I GOTTA SCREAM...YEAH 
I GET UP , I GET DOWN 
WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME 

SWEET LITTLE ROCK N' ROLLER 
KEEP ON COMIN' MY WAY 
SWEET LITTLE ROCK N' ROLLER 

I MEET YOU RIGHT BY THE STATION 
WHERE YOU CALLIN' FOR ME 
I GIVE YOU ONE NIGHT 
I GIVE YOU ONE HEART 
WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME 

15 , 16 , 17 , I DON'T CARE
