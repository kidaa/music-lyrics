I WAS BORN IN A CRADLE OF STONE
NEVER THOUGHT, I HAD TO MAKE IT ALONE
AND WHAT WAS COMIN' TO ME
ALL JUST A BUNCH OF LIES
N' I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
YOU'RE THE MASTER OF DISGUISE

CRAZY MAMA, YOU KEEP ON COMIN' MY WAY
NOW IT'S OVER
YOU AIN'T GONNA MAKE MY DAY
NO, NOT AGAIN
MOUNTAIN MAMA

YOU WHERE FEEDING MY HEAD
WITH MORE THAN I COULD TAKE
ALWAYS WATCHING WITH YOUR SERIOUS EYES
EVERY MOVE THAT I MAKE
SOME TIMES IT'S LIKE HEAVEN
SO I CAN TELL
DARKER THAN COAL, HOTTER THAN HELL
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT
FEEL LIKE I'M CAUGHT IN A SPELL

CRAZY MAMA, YOU KEEP ON COMIN' MY WAY
NOW IT'S OVER
YOU AIN'T GONNA STEAL MY PAY
NO, NOT AGAIN
MOUNTAIN MAMA

NO NEVER AGAIN, MOUNTAIN MAMA
DON'T LIKE THAT KINDA GAME, I DON'T WANNA
THERE'S JUST YOU TO BLAME
MOUNTAIN MAMA
SO YOU BETTER FORGET MY NAME
MOUNTAIN MAMA
