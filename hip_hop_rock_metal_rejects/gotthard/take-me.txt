He came walking through fire 
I saw him walk on water too 
A kind of living wire he's not like me and you... yeah, true 

You can't demand reaction 
He just holds the line 
To get his satisfaction, 
It's only a matter of time 
A matter of time 

No more, lonely figures in the night 
Gotta find a way to break out free, yeah! 
Why don't you 

Take me, take me, take me to the wall of the big emotion 
Take me, take me so I can see 
The mirrors of destiny 

He just gotta snap his fingers 
And everything's just there around 
Be careful, never hide 
The sun before his eyes, before his eyes 

No more lonely creatures in the night 
Gotta find a way to break out free, yeah! 
Why don't you...
