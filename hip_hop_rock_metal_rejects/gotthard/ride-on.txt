HUNGER , IN THE SADDLE AGAIN 
I JUST CAN'T SAY NO 
THUNDER , THE CALL OF THE WILD 
THATS WHEN I GOT TO GO 

NEVER GOT ENOUGH 
ALWAYS BACK FOR MORE 
I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD, I'M ALIVE 
I HEAR THE MOTOR RUMBLE 
N'RUNNING OVERDRIVE 

INTO THE NIGHT 
KNOW I GONNA FIND 
WHERE IS THE ROAD 
FOR THE PEACE OF MIND 
IT'S A NEVERENDING RIDE 
ON THE WINGS OF DESTINY 
DON'T KNOW `BOUT TOMORROW 
OR WHAT WILL BE 

ALL I WANT IS 

RIDE ON , RIDE ON 
UNDER ONE BIG SKY 
RIDE ON , RIDE ON 
TILL THE DAY I DIE 

DEVIL , GOTTA WAIT FOR ME 
I'M DOWN ON "1O1" 
THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY NUMBER 
MY LIFE HAS JUST BEGUN 

NEVER GOT ENOUGH 
ALWAYS BACK FOR MORE 
I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD I'M ALIVE 
I GOT MY MOTOR BURNIN', YEAH 
N' RUNNIN' OVERDRIVE
