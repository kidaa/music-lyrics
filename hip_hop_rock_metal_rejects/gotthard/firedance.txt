Once again I start to wonder 
Sailing thoughts on endless sea 
Might be you I see reflected, from afar 
Could be just my fantasy 

All my love, and emotion 
Life is nothing without you 
Like a drop finds the ocean 
I'm gonna find my way to you 

Low thunder rollin' 
Take me away, away 
There's something callin' 
Askin' me to play 

Firedance, it's a firedance 
Firedance, just a firedance, oh yeah 

I'm the wind against the mountains 
I'm the fire deep inside 
I feel the magic, the rhythm is my soul 
I no longer have to hide 

Join me now, come on over 
There's a place right here for you 
Seize the moment and discover 
All the things you always knew
