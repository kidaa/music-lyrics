Since you've been gone 
There's a darkness 
Nowhere a light to be found 
The clock on the wall's 
holding back the time 
It's clear that I'm just going down 

You an I were make for one another 
And I believed that dream for too long 

All that you left was a letter 
I can't get it out of my mind 
No more laughter, no more sun 
Alone at the scene of the crime 

Now here I am, searching for forgiveness 
But nothing seems to matter anymore 

There's no tomorrow, only fire in the rain 
You say you're sorry 
But only memories remain 
You can't tell me there's a reason 
Why I should go trough all this pain 
And once again, once again 
I call your name 

Love was the wrong destination 
And I can't find healing touch 
But I won't forsake I won't give up 
Guess I still need you to much 

So here we are strangers to each other 
When once we held 
the whole world in our hands 

There's no tomorrow.... 

You say in this life no one's wrong 
And nobody's right 
You say that you need to be free 
And that's what is killing me 

There's no tomorrow, only fire in the rain 
You say you're sorry 
But only memories remain 
There's no tomorrow 
and I'm the only one to blame 
You can't tell me there's a reason 
Why I should go trough all this pain 
And once again, once again 
I call your name
