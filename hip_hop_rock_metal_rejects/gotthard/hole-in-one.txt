C' MON LET'S SHAKE 'EM 
YEAH , I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING 
WITH A BIG MESS IN MY BRAIN 
I TRY HARD TO REMEMBER 
STRIVES ARE ALL IN VAIN 

BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT 
I'M A LUCKY MAN 
THAT'S WHAT I AM 

THERE'S ONE CHANCE IN A MILLION 
JUST LIKE A HOLE IN ONE 


WHEN I GET RIGHT INTO TROUBLE 
WATER TO MY CHIN 
I TURN THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE BABE 
AND GET ANOTHER SPIN 

AND THAT'S ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT 
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, GOOD TO ME 

THERE'S ONE CHANCE IN A MILLION 
JUST LIKE A HOLE IN ONE 

...KEEP THAT BAD BOY TURNIN' ROUND 

BABY BABY BABY 
IVE BEEN LOOSIN MY MIND 
YEAH SINCE IVE BEEN LOOSIN YOU.........
