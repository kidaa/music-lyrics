I GOT A DEVIL IN ME 
LORD IT'S HARD TO MAKE BELIEVE 
IT'S SHAKIN' IN ME BABE 
I FEEL IT RUNNING , KICKING , 
HE'S GOTTA BREAK FREE 

MOVIN' ON , MOVIN' ON, MOVIN' ON 
FROM TIME TO TIME 
MOVIN' ON , MOVIN' ON , MOVIN' ON 
FROM TIME TO TIME 

YA KNOW THAT IT'S SO EASY 
TO LOOSE CONTROL 
IT GETS YOUR WHOLE BODY N' SOUL 
SOME WOULD GIVE IT 
SOME WOULD NOT 
I GUESS I'M JUST THE KINDA GUY 
WHO CAN'T STOP 

I GOT YOU NOW 
AND I'M UNDER YOUR SKIN 
I GOT YOU NOW 
LET NO OTHER COME IN 
I GOT YOU NOW 
I GOT YOU NOW 
I GOT YOU NOW, I SWEAR I'LL NEVER LET GO 

MOVIN' ON.......
