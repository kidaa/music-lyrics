ACROSS THE DESERT, THROUGH THE PLAINES 
FREEDOM RIDERS, IN ANGER THEY CAME 
UNDER COVER O' PROPHETS 
AND THE WORDS OF THE SAINTS 
DOIN' ALL FOR THE JUSTICE 
DOIN' ALL FOR THE GAIN 

ANYTIME , ANYWHERE 
THE FIGHTING GOES ON 
ANYTIME , ANYDAY 
SEE THOSE LIVES GET BLOWN AWAY 

IN THE NAME , IN THE NAME OF SOME GOD 
THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR NOTHING 
SPILLING THEIR BLOOD 
IN THE NAME , IN THE NAME OF A SIN 
ALL RUNNING FOR COVER 
IN A FIGHT THEY CAN'T WIN 

UNHOLD IS THE PROMISE 
YOU' RE LEAVIN' TO DIE 
ON THE GATES OF EDEN 
YOU CAN'T TELL NO LIE 
HEAR THE MOARNS OF THE YOUNG ONES 
LEFT OUT IN PAIN 
IT'S THE LAW OF THE STRONG ONES 
WHO'S LEADING THE BANE 

ANYTIME , ANYWHERE 
THE FIGHTING GOES ON 
ANYTIME , ANYDAY 
SEE THOSE LIVES GET BLOWN AWAY 

IN THE NAME , IN THE NAME OF SOME GOD 
THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR NOTHING 
SPILLING THEIR BLOOD 
IN THE NAME , IN THE NAME OF A SIN 
ALL RUNNING FOR COVER 
FOR NOTHIN AT ALL
