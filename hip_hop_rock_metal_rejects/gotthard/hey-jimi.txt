EVERY NIGHT I WALK THE STREETS
THAT LIGHT MY SOUL
AND I PICK UP THE PIECES
YOU LEFT SO LONG AGO
YOU GIMME THE FAITH
YOU GIMME A HAND
WHEN GOD'S MADE LOVE IN
ELECTRIC LADY-LAND

HEY, I CAN'T START A FIRE
BUT I CAN KEEP THE FLAME
NO, I CAN'T GET MUCH HIGHER
HEY JIMI
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU

I'M SEARCHING THE RED HOUSE
WITH MY VOODOO CHILE
FOXY LADY, KEEP COMIN' WHEN I KISS THE SKY
YOU GAVE ME STONE FREE
GAVE ME PURPLE HAZE
AND A LITTLE WING'S STROKE IS ALL
I NEED TODAY

HEY, I CAN'T START A FIRE
BUT I CAN KEEP THE FLAME
NO, I CAN'T GET MUCH HIGHER
HEY JIMI
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU

YEAH, YOU BRING ME BACK THE GOOD OLD DAY'S
OF ROCK N' ROLL
WHEN YOUR GUITAR WAS ALWAYS READY TO SING
NO COMPROMISE AT ALL
LIKE A BIG BASS-DRUM
THE BEAT OF MY HEART
MAN, YOU TEACH THE WORLD HOW TO ROCK
WITH A BLACK MAN'S SOUL

HEY, I CAN'T START A FIRE
BUT I CAN KEEP THE FLAME
NO, I CAN'T GET MUCH HIGHER
HEY JIMI
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU

......ONE MORE LICK
