DON' T KNOW WHO' S TO BLAME, 
DON' T KNOW WHO WAS WRONG 
LOVE HAS DIED TOO SOON 
AFTER ALL HAD JUST BEGUN 
SOMETHING IN YOUR EYES 
TELLS ME YOU STILL CARE 
OH BABY I SWEAR 

DEEP INSIDE MY HEART 
DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL 
SOMETHING TELLS ME NO 
I CAN'T LET YOU GO 
SAW IT IN YOUR EYES 
LAST TIME WHEN WE MET 
I WILL NEVER FORGET 

HOW CAN YOU SAY 
OUR LOVE IS GONNA LAST FOREVER 
HOW CAN YOU GO 
WITH THIS EMPTY BROKEN HEART OF MINE 

LET IT BE , LET IT BE 
LOVE'S LIKE A GUN ON ME 
LET IT BE , JUST LET IT BE 
LIKE A BAG OF BROKEN GLASS 
I WAS KILLED IN THE NAME OF LOVE 

YOU NEVER SEE IT COMIN' 
DOESN'T TELL YOU WHEN IT GOES 
THINK IT'S GETTIN' NEAR 
SUDDENLY IT'S GONE 
DIRTY LITTLE GAME 
DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME 
YOU JUST WOULDN'T SAY 

DID YOU EVER WORRY 
ASKIN' MAYBE PLEASE 
KNEW YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT 
I WOULD GET DOWN ON MY KNEES 
SEARCHING FOR WAY OUT 
BUT THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT 
IT'S LIKE GOIN' BLIND 

.....GET DOWN ON MY KNEES FOR YOU 

HOW CAN YOU SAY 
YOU LOVE ME BUT IT'S BETTER THIS WAY 
IF YOU DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE 
I'M DROWNING DOWN LIKE NEVER BEFORE 
SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET YOU GO
