I can't believe it gets so hard 
Every single day that we're apart, yeah 
I lose control, you know that's true 

Say you do, say you will 
To make you stay, I'm thinking I would kill, yeah 
So take a look, see what you've done 

You're one in a million 
One in a million miles away 
Just wanna be near you 
Wanna be near you now 
Near you night and day, oh yeah 

Now I can't shake it loose 
And I can't break the chain, read my mind 
Then you would feel the pain, yeah 
Won't you come on home and set me free 

Say you will, say you do 
Tried a thousand ways just to get to you, oh 
And one of these days, I'll turn around 
And you'll be there 

You're one in a million.... 

... another chance is all I need 
MILES AWAY... gotta stop my heart from bleeding 
MILES AWAY... well I got one more card to play 
MILES AWAY... `ll lay it down to make you stay 
... one in a million 

One in a million 
One in a million miles away 
Just wanna be near you 
Wanna be near you night and day 
One in a million 
One in a million miles away 
Just wanna be near you 
Wanna be near you now 
Near you night and day 
One in a million
