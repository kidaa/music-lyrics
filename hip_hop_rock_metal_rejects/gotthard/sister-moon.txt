Sister Moon, come lead me down 
To rest my weary head 
I walked a million miles along 
The road of no regret 
No regret 

I've been a fool, I messed around 
A lock without a key 
I'm waiting for the morning sun 
To make it shine on me 

So long, lonely days 
Take me back where I belong 
Where I belong now 
It's all gone, it's all behind 
Hope you don't mind 
Hope you don't mind 
Hope you don't mind 

Hope you don't mind 

Too many times I lost the grip 
Was worn out on the floor 
Fallen angel, don't you loose your wings 
'Cause you'll never fly no more, no 

Chorus 2x 

Hope you don't mind
