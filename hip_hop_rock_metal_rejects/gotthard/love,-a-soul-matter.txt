You can go to the east, go to the west
there are so many ways to find happiness
there is so much to take, so much to give
so many trails and so many tricks

And you're gonna be wrong, you're gonna be right
someday you'll be down some you'll be up
but whatever you do whatever you say
there's only one thing that can show you the way

Love, a soul matter, our heaven on earth
Love, forever, wherever you go

You can live without clothes on top of a hill
don't care about money and do what you will
or live in a castle, diamonds and gold
you still won't be happy if you can't find love

We all have our dreams that we keep in our hearts
some may come true and some may fall apart
sunshine and rain, that's what it's all about
live as you like but don't live without

Love, a soul matter, our heaven on earth
Love, forever, wherever you go

Look to the east, Look to the west
look all around to find happiness
brothers and sisters, all over the world
lets get together, let it be love
