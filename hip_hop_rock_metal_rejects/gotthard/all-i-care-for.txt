Another day before us 
and we're ready for the show 
across the land of mystery 
everyone with their own dream 
sometimes harder than they seam 

Here I am far away 
hundred miles and oceans from you 
feel the need to cry out loud 
I want you to know 

oh, you're all I care for 
oh, you're all I care for 
you're all I need 

Soon I will be back again 
I know, it's hard to love a kind of man 
always on the line 
always out of time 
just one thin I know for sure 

Here I am far away 
hundred miles and oceans from you 
feel the need to cry out loud 
I want you to know 

oh, you're all I care for 
oh, you're all I care for 
oh, you're all I care for 
you're all I need
