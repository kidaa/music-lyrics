Heaven knows, I've been trough many ups n' downs
Live has been no friend of mine, I never got my crown
Suffocate my troubles in an empty glass of wine
To realize I was a fool, I thought she was all mine

Tried to make the best of it, a little day by day
Had all of the best cards, n' gave them all away
took place in the front row of the rollercoaster ride.
Play it, do or die, God knows I tried

We believed it's gonna last forever
after all I know, this was just a lie

Out on my own, since you left me
Lord what a long, long time
Since you've been gone
Out on my own now, girl you hurt me
But it's all over now, the heartache is gone.

Now I know every story has a message I can use
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to loose
But we all run after something we will never find
A pair of blue eyes always makes us blind

We believed it's gonna last forever
after all I know, this was just a lie

Out on my own, since you left me
Lord what a long time
Since you've been gone
Out on my own, girl you hurt me
But it's all over now, you set me free

Na, na ,na
