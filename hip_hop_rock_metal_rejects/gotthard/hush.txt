I got a certain little girl, 
that's on my mind 
no doubt about it, 
she look so fine 
she's the best girl that i've ever had 
sometimes for sure make me feel so bad 

na, na, na...... 

hush, hush, i thought i heard callin'my name now 
hush, hush, she broke my heart 
but i love her just the same now 
hush, hush, i thought i heard callin' my name now 
hush, hush, i need her love and i'm now not 
to blame now 

I've got her early in the morning 
I've got her late in the evening 
oh, i wanna never need it now 
oh, gotta, gotta have it 
gotta have it now 

She's got lovin' like quick sand 
only took one touch of her hand 
blow my mind and i meant so deep 
i can't eat all 
i can't sleep 

na, na, na...... 

hush, hush, i thought i heard callin' my name now 
hush, hush, she broke my heart 
but i lover her just the same now 
hush, hush, i thought i heard callin' my name now 
hush, hush, i need her love and i'm now not 
to blame now
