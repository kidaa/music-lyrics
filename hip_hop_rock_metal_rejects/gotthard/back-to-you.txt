BLUE EYED SISTER MERCY
BEAUTIFUL QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A STRANGER
THEN YOU'RE HOLDING ME TIGHT

GOT ME UNDER YOUR LAW
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN GUARANTEE
BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER
YOU'LL TURN YOUR PRETTY BACK ON ME, YEAH

TIME AND AGAIN INTO TROUBLE
LIVIN' A LIE ON YOUR OWN
HUNTING LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT
LIKE A DOG FOR THE BONE

IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TIME
AND TIME IS ALL YOU NEED
YOU LIVE A LIFE PRETENDING
AND WHAT YOU CANNOT GET YOU STEAL
GONNA GET IT WITH A RHYME
GONNA PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
CUZ ALL FROM GOOD TO EVIL, BABY
IT'S COMING BACK TO YOU

YOU GOT NO SURE DESTINATION
PLAYIN' THE GAME FAR TOO LONG
OF USE AND ABUSE, NO TIME TO LOOSE
BUT THAT'S WRONG, SO WRONG

WHY DON'T YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE
I'M NOT ASKING FOR SOME CHARITY
ANOTHER DAY IS OVER
I JUST WANNA SET YOU FREE

IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TIME
AND TIME IS ALL YOU NEED
YOU LIVE A LIFE PRETENDING
AND WHAT YOU CANNOT GET YOU STEAL
GONNA GET IT WITH A RHYME
GONNA PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
CUZ ALL FROM GOOD TO EVIL, BABY
IT'S COMING BACK, IT'S COMING BACK, IT'S COMING BACK TO YOU

IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TIME
AND TIME IS ALL YOU NEED
YOU LIVE A LIFE PRETENDING
AND WHAT YOU CANNOT GET YOU STEAL
GONNA GET IT WITH A RHYME
GONNA PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
CUZ ALL FROM GOOD TO EVIL, BABY
IT'S COMING BACK TO YOU
