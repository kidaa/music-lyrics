Well I'm driving down a highway 
Like so many times before 
While listening to the music, loud and proud 
I'm movin' on 

Every time it's the same 
I hear you callin' my name, my name 
I've been away for too long 
Can't wait to see you again 
Oh, you know I miss you 

Downtown, downtown 
It's always the same 
Downtown, downtown 

I hear the sound of every heartbeat 
When the night is comin' down, down 
I know exactly the place 
Where all my friends are goin' to be 
It's easy to see 

Every time it's the same 
I know, you're callin' my name, my name 
I've been away for too long 
Can't wait to see you again 
Oh, you know I miss you 

Downtown, downtown 
It's always the same 
Downtown, downtown.... right!
