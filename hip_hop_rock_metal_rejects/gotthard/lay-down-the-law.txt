EVERYBODY'S INTO THE RACE 
FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION 
HOLDING ON ILLUSIONS 
WHERE MONEY RULES THE WORLD 

TRAVELLIN' AT SPEED O' LIGHT 
TO SELF MADE DESTRUCTION 
ANOTHER MR. NICE TALK 
SURE'S GONNA CHANGE IT ALL 

AS LONG AS I CAN ROLL ALL THE DICE 
I KEEP ON PLAYING 
KNOCK ON WOOD 
AND EVEN IN THE DARKEST OF HOURS 
SOMEONE'S WATCHING OVER YOU 

LAY DOWN THE LAW 

NO YOU CAN'T KEEP THE RAIN 
FROM FALLING DOWN ON YOUR HEAD 
GOTTA PLAY BY THE RULES; 
RULES THAT SOME OTHERS HAVE SET 

BUT DON'T YOU EVER LET YOUR DREAMS 
TO BE TAKEN FOREVER 
BEWARE OF WHAT YOU SEE 
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WHAT YOU GET 

AS LONG AS I CAN........
