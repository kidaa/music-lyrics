I've been waiting, all my life 
For the sun to make it mine 
Callin', callin' 
Whispering your name 
And right now you're on my trail 
Fallin', fallin' wishing you near 
But somehow you slipped away 
Like ice in the sun, already gone 

One life, one soul 
Forever I know 
Follow me, follow me 
Wherever I go 
One life, one soul 
Just waiting to flow 
Follow me, follow me 
Don't let me go 

I've been dreamin' for too long 
Chasing rainbows on my own 
Screamin', screamin' 
You are the wind in my sail 
In an ocean so wide 
Over good times, bad times 
I'll be your own guiding light 
Holding your hand 
Eyes open wide 
And always beside 

Chorus 2x 

Don't let me go...
