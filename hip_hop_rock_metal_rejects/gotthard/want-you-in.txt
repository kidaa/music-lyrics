AIN'T NO BLACK AIN'T NO WHITE
THERE'S NO LEFT AND NO RIGHT
AIN'T NO JUSTICE WITHOUT CRIME
GOT NO SONG TO SING WITHOUT A RHYME

GOT TO HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN ME
NEED SOME TIME TO GET THE PICTURE CLEAR
I CAN'T EXPLAIN, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY I NEED YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU TO GO

I WANT YOU IN, I WANT YOU OUT
THERE'S NO SOLUTION TO MY ENDLESS DOUBT
EVERYTIME I'M CLAIMIN' VICTORY
HOLD ON BABY,GOTTA HOLD ON ME 
HOLD ON ME

THERE'S NO COURAGE WITHOUT  FEAR
CAN'T BE GONE, IF YOU SEE ME HERE
I'M CONFUSED ENDLESSLY
CUZ YOU'RE NOT, WHERE I WANT YOU TO BE

GOT TO HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN ME
NEED SOME TIME TO GET THE PICTURE CLEAR
I CAN'T EXPLAIN, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY I NEED YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU TO GO

I WANT YOU IN, I WANT YOU OUT
THERE'S NO SOLUTION TO MY ENDLESS DOUBT
EVERYTIME I'M CLAIMIN' VICTORY
HOLD ON BABY, GOTTA HOLD ON ME

NOW YOU'RE GONE, AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU LEFT, WHEN I LOVE YOU SO

I WANT YOU IN, I WANT YOU OUT
THERE'S NO SOLUTION, TO MY ENDLESS DOUBT
I WANT YOU IN, I WANT YOU OUT
I'M GOING CRAZY, MAKES ME SCREAM N' SHOUT

I WANT YOU IN, I WANT YOU OUT
THERE'S NO SOLUTION, TO MY ENDLESS DOUBT
EVERYTIME I'M CLAIMIN' VICTORY
HOLD ON BABY,GOTTA HOLD ON ME

I WANT YOU IN
I WANT YOU OUT
