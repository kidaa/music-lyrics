SO NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE AWAY
NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT AROUND ME
I'M TRYING HARD TO HIDE THIS EMPTINESS

EVERY HEARTACHE LEAVES A SCAR, A TRACE BEHIND IT
AND GOD, I ONLY PUT THE BLAME ON ME

ARE YOU REALLY THERE, OR JUST A VISION
ARE YOU REALLY THERE, OR JUST A DREAM
AM I GOING TO TAKE THE RIGHT DECISION
JUST A VISION
ARE YOU REALLY THERE FOR ME

YOU GAVE WHAT YOU HAD TO GIVE
I TOOK IT ALL FOR GRANTED, YEAH
EVERY NOW AND THEN I FEEL YOU'RE THERE
WHEN I'M LAYIN' AT BED AT NIGHT
I COULD SWEAR YOU'RE THERE BESIDE ME
ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT I'M WAISTING, WONDERING

ARE YOU REALLY THERE, OR JUST A VISION
ARE YOU REALLY THERE, OR JUST A DREAM
AM I GOING TO TAKE THE RIGHT DECISION
JUST A VISION
ARE YOU REALLY THERE FOR ME
