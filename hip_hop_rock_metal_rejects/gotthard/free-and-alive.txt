DON'T YOU REALIZE
YOU GET UP EVERY MORNING
AND YOUR CHILDREN'S FINE
TOO BUSY MAKING MONEY
TO NOTICE THAT THE SUN HAS RISED AGAIN, OH YEAH

BUT IT'S IN THE HUMAN NATURE
TO COMPLAIN
WHEN WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND
SOME OTHERS LIVE A LIVE NOT HALF AS GOOD
JUST WAITING FOR THEIR END

BUT I'M FREE AND ALIVE
I'M FREE AND ALIVE

DON'T YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE LIVING IN A PLACE YOU CALL HOME
AND YOU'RE NEVER SATISFIED
CUZ THE NEIGHBOUR HAS
WHAT YOU WHERE DREAMING OF ... FOR LONG

THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
WHY DON'T WE UNDERSTAND
THE SIMPLE THINGS IN LIVE
CAN GIVE US MORE, MORE THAN WE PRETEND

BUT I'M FREE AND ALIVE
I'M FREE AND ALIVE

BUT I'M FREE AND ALIVE
I'M FREE AND ALIVE
