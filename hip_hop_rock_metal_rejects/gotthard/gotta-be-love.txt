YOU LOVE TO SHOW THE PEOPLE
WHAT YOU GOT
AND IT'S HURTING ME AGAIN, YEAH, YEAH
CUZ I NEVER FOUND THE WORDS
TO LET YOU KNOW
TO ME YOU'RE MORE THAN JUST A FRIEND, YOU KNOW

DESPERATION CALLIN'
I HEAR IT EVERYWHERE
FALLIN' DEEP IN TROUBLE
SCREAM N' I'LL BE THERE
THERE'S GOTTA BE AN ANSWER
TO MY BURNING FLAME
NO WAY TO GET OVER
I'M IN THE GAME

IT'S GOTTA BE LOVE, AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT
IT'S GOTTA BE LOVE, MAYBE JUST ONE DAY
IT'S GOTTA BE LOVE, GOT THE FEELING THAT I
CAN'T GO WRONG,
GO WRONG,
CAN'T GO WRONG

CAPTURED BY THE BEAUTY OF YOUR SMILE
WHY DON'T YOU SET ME FREE, OH YEAH
CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER FOR I KNOW
THAT YOU BELONG TO ME

SOMETIMES I THINK I CAN'T HOLD ON ANOTHER DAY
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M BORN AGAIN
SOMETIMES I WISH YOU'D KNOW HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME
SOMEDAY LOVE WILL LIGHT THE WAY OH YEAH
LOVE WILL LIGHT THE WAY
OH YEAH
