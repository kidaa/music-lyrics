THE ROAD IS LONG, WITH THE MANY AWINDING TURN 
THAT LEADS US TO WHO KNOWS WHERE, 
WHO KNOWS WHERE 

BUT I'M STRONG, STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY HIM 
HE AIN'T HEAVY, HE'S MY BROTHER 

SO ON WE GO, 
HIS WELFARE IS MY CONCERN 
NO BURDEN IS HE TO BEAR, WE'LL GET THERE 

FOR I KNOW , HE WOULD NOT ENCOMBER ME 
HE AIN'T HEAVY , HE'S MY BROTHER 

IF I'M LADEN AT ALL 
I'M LADEN WITH SADNESS 
THAT EVERYONE'S HEART ISN'T FILLED 
WITH THE GLADNESS OF LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER 

IT'S A LONG LONG ROAD, 
FROM WHICH THERE IS NO RETURN 
WHILE WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THERE 
WHY NOT SHARE 

AND THE LOAD DOESN'T WEIGH ME DOWN AT ALL 
HE AIN'T HEAVY, HE'S MY BROTHER
