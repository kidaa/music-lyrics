Take Head that no man should decieve you
For many shall come and try to lead you
You'll hear of wars and rumours will set
Yet be not troubled it's not the time yet
It is written now it is written now
It's the beginning of sorrows
The beginning of the beginning of
The beginning of sorrows

For nations rising against nations
Kingdoms fighting against kingdoms
There shall be famine world-shaking pesteilence
Yet be not troubled it's not the end yet
It is written now it is written now
It's the beginning of sorrows

Fear not my brethren and my sistren
Jah light soon come fear not my brethren
I have great new, Jah manifestation

The beginning of sorrows
The beginning of sorrows
The beginning of sorrows
