We in ah heavy weight style and we kick it
Know we inner de zone and we mash it
And we go home and we make the room tear down
Das what de dred come fe do
I know the people understand
When they see the dredder with the mic in ah me hand
We make the vibe just cool when you see we rocking
Heavy weight we got the fuel
Yer you know we tear it up coming with the action
Yer you know we're on top
Yer you know we're like a bomb
Ready to go off we got the ammunition
Yer you know that it's on
DJ rocks the place from dust till dawn anner
Co you know that it's on
We tears it up from dusk till dawn
Kill them with the rhythm
Coz we come to set it off, set it off
Yah know say we come fe set it off, set it off
Yah know say we come fe set it off, set it off
You know that we come fe set it off, set it off
You know that we come fe set it off, set it off
You know say we come fe set it off
Know we've stated what we want in ah der place
Now its up to you to move your body to the bass
We're hitting hard and coming strong
As you're jumping around you coulder never do no wrong
Set up the sound and make it rock
Coming with the power musically can't stop
We no want no negative in ah der place
Stepping up a gear we got the bass you can taste
Come follow me one and two an
[Chorus]
You know the people dem ah rock and everything is just fine
We no need no violence we no need no crime
And if you deal with that dem dial 999 babylon will beat you up
And put you back in to line rude boy its you I man talking to
Yer man
[Chorus]
Set it off Ginger Ford him in ah A1 Class
Set it off Danite Pea him in ah A1 Class
Set it off Benji Singer in ah A1 Class
Set it off Jeff Rose him in ah A1 Class
Kill them with the rhythm coz we come to set it off
