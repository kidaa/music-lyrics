This just aint fair
What you trying do to me
Trying make me crazy
Telling me just how it should be
And ive got to know
Which way are we gunner go
Gunner take it fast or slow
But with you I never know

Its never the same these things that your saying
And who is to blame this world it is swaying

I know when youre lying
Theres no point in crying

Well if thats how the girl is treating you man,
youre out of your mind
She is disrespecting the programme
and you cant see the signs
The girls shes got you like a puppet,
man youre deaf or youre blind

Blackmail you throw
Using me emotionally
That aint how it should be
Lock me up and eat the key
Let your love flow
Thats the way its meant to be
Love should flow more easily
Theres enough for you and me

Its never the same these game that youre playing
And who is to blame my world it is swaying

I know when youre lying
Theres no point in crying
Those crocodile tears wont work
Stop using your tears
