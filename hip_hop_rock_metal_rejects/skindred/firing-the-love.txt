You're just a big Jinel,
Loves hate professional
Charlatan, Now who can tell?
They'll take you straight to hell
Love burns perpetual
Locked in a broken cell
Grave passion is denied
Guilty of what? She cried

Am in love with you but are you in love with me
Firing the love what, firing the love what
Firing the love firing the ho

Wrong move you'll break your neck
Its time you come correct
Give thanks 4 daily bread
Go wash your dirty head

The original troglodyte
Dressed up like dolomite
One match the worlds alight
Dogma can make you fight

Am in love with you but are you in love with me
Firing the love what, firing the love what
Firing the love firing the ho

How much do you love me but i hate you love
Am in love with you but are you in love with me
Firing the love what, firing the love what
Firing the love firing the ho

Fishy in the water fishy in the sea
Who'd you love best fishy or me
