World domination equals world suffocation
Yer its dread out there you know
Earth confrontation equals earth segregation
Yer its dread out there you know
Man mutilation scientific innovation
Yer its dread out there you know
Chemical reaction could reduce the population
Yer you know they're trying to fix me
But then they break me down again
Yer you know they're trying to fix me
And I can't take no
More domination
Your domination
Biologic hazard's causing world deterioration
Yer its dread out there you know
Adding to palliation environmental situation
Yer its dread out there you know
Chemical reaction would reduce the population
Yer its dread out there you know
Yer you know they're trying to fix me
But then they break me down again
Yer you know they're trying to fix me
And I can't take no
More domination
Your domination
Yer its dread out there you know
Yer its dread out there you know
