Easy selector cos I know that you're ruff
And the way you play ya tunes ya know you're musically tough
I catch your vibe and the way you carry on
An you feel say you wicked as you rock the session
Pull it back know one time dreadlocks beco me no
You addy original don don
Play the B-side this instrumental beg you a piece of the version
Selector pull the tune back me brethren
Selector pull it back again
Selector wheel and come again no man
Selector play the tune again
Selector Selector you got to pull it up, got to pull it up
Selector Selector you got to pick it up you gorra pull it up
Move the decks and try to take up the mic
And show the people in the place you've got the skills to excite
You get blanked like your not even there
Even though in ah dem face you just constantly stare
Jack it again I wanna ride the rhythm I wanna rock the rhythm
Now pull it up up up up up
Murder the tune now with a subsonic boom
Das how we rock out the room now pull it up up up up up
Selector pull the tune again me brethren
Selector pull it back again
Selector wheel and come again no man
Selector play the tune again
Selector Selector you got to pull it up, got to pull it up
Selector Selector you got to pick it up you gorra pull it up
[Chorus]
Pull it up one time Selector
BOOM!!!
