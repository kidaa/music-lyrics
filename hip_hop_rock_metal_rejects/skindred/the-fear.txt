Time for talking to, work it all out
Can not the pressure nuff addy youth dem ah shot
Children suffering screams are in vain
An they're dealing with the tormenting again and again
Time for stalling lets work it all out
Some will use the tongue to spit their venom about
Sticks and stones hurt and words they can kill
Harassment and oppression, why can't people just chill
The rude boys are coming so get out of here
Find a place to hide because nuff youth dem ah fear
Stand in ah dem way you know you will disappear
The rude boys are coming and I, I just don't fear
We don't fear rude boy get out of here
With your bully boy tactics you disappear
Don't fear rude gal get out of here
With your bad gal business, disappear
In the play yard the battle is on
And who is going to tell them
That their vibes dem is wrong
Teachers shouting lets sort this out
But when she turns her back
They smack you straight in the mouth
Gunner get you with intimidation
Stand up and be counted cause a counteraction
Turn the tables to know how it feels
You would want them to stop if it was them on your heels
The rude boys are coming so get out of here
Find a place to hide because nuff youth dem ah fear
Stand in ah dem way you know you will disappear
The rude boys are coming and I,
I just don't fear
We don't fear rude boy get out of here
With your bully boy tactics you disappear
Don't fear rude gal get out of here
With your bad gal business, disappear
