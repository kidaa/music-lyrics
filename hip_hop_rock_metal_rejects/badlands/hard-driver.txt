Starin' at the highway lines 
Is a fever, that I know, 
Tonight my burning bridges 
Light the skies 
The engine scream for murder 
And tonight we're gonna bleed 
Pushin' the limit through 
On a red light rocket ride 
The wheels are fire 
But A's all right, all right 
They're gonna bum for me tonight 
*Hard driver, ridin' alone 
'Cause there's no lookin' back 
And you're never comin' home 
Hard driver. you're on your own, 
Give it all, hard driver 
Turn the ship into the wind 
Let the engines roar 
Curse the gods 
And let the metal cry 
The eyes of total madness 
Are the windows to the soul 
You'd be a fool to stop 
On the edge of lost control 
The wheels are fire 
But it's all right, all right 
They're gonna bum for me tonight 
* Repeat 2 times 
Give it all, hard driver 
And there's no lookin' back 
'Cause you're never comin' home
