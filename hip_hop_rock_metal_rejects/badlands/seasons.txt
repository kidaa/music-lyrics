I know it's late 
And the swing's gently giving ground 
Shadows remain 
Of the words that were never spoken 
All the years 
That we once held in our hands 
Just leave us to wonder 
Still the winds are changing all the time 
But I know it's too late 
The sessions all gone by, oh 
Seasons can wait 
Till a thousand years 
Have come and gone 
Stories we wrote 
All the days that were never counted 
Time alone 
All the dreams we thought 
Would never die 
But then there's tomorrow 
For these dreams will save 
Our lonely times 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by, oh 
Hear the crashing sound And 
time slips away Feel them... . 
Wearing this chain on my hands 
And I shll bear 
Oh Lord, rain on you forever 
Oh listen! 
I know it's a late 
And the evening's greatly giving ground 
Shadows remain 
Of the words that we 
never spoken 
Though I dream 
Sometimes dreams are all I know 
Leave us to wonder 
Though the winds are changing 
All the time 
But I know it's a too late 
The seasons all gone by, oh 
But I know it a too late 
The seasons all gone try 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by 
Feels so good, oh 
And you feel so good, oh 
And the faith has changed 
Oh with the centuries now 
Oh you can feel the change 
So many 
But I know it's too late 
The seasons all gone by
