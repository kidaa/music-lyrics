Falling leaves have changed their color 
Winter's on its way 
I'm lookin' for the sunny part of town 
And even now 
I hear the wicked cold winds call me 
They say my don't fly away 
Drink the... 
Feel the heat front a fire's blaze 
You take a long walk 
In those lonely winter days 
You hear her cry cut in the cold 
Baby, hold me, hold me 
Don't fly away 
Winter's cold winds call me 
Gonna leave it all behind 
Summer breezes fill my mind 
Fill my mind, oh yes they do now 
*Winter's cold winds call me 
Gonna leave it all behind 
Summer breezes fill my mind 
They Fill my mind, 
All your love 
Is what I need from you 
All your love 
Is gonna keep me warm 
Through the winter storm 
I give it to you, baby 
You give it to me now, mama 
Repeat *

All your love 
Oh... 
All your love 
Is what I need from you 
All your love
