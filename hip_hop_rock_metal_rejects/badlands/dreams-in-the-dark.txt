I remember you, baby 
Like a sweet summer song 
Said you'd love me forever 
Nothing could ever go wrong 
Time's gone by 
I'm just a memory scarred 
I'm lost in a shadow 
Don't know where you are 
'Cause yesterday's gone 
Dreams carry on 
Will you return my way, no 
Sing me a sweet, sweet Song 
Turn out the lights 
And my love will burn on and On 
Hold me until tomorrow 
Dreams in the dark 
Dreams in the dark 
You pushed me, baby 
A little too far 
Turned your back on my lovin' 
Lick my wounds in the bars 
Story's been told 
And a lesson is learned 
I know where your love lies 
And I know where you've gone 
'Cause yesterday's gone 
Dreams carry on 
Will you return my way. no 
* Repeat 
Baby, I know that you're leavin 
it's over, it's over, I know 
Now that My heart now is bleedin' 
Don't know which way to turn 
Run home! 
* Repeat 2 times 
Dreams in the dark
