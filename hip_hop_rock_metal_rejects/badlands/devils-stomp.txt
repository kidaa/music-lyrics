I needed time to think things over 
To heal my soul and ease the pain 
And through a glass a revelation 
I could swear I heard the darkness 
Call my name 
Imagination's runnin' 
For too long, yeah 
The mind we lost 
Can read the senses wrong 
I need a shot of realization 
I can't believe the things I've seen 
'Cause down the bar set the devil man 
As he turned around and 
smiled He said to me, he said 
*Hey boy, I know What you're lookin' for 
 It feels so good to be so well 
Just take a chance 
Step through my open Door 
Lord! 
*Now boy, I know you're oh so young 
And the whole world shines 
In front of you 
But I can give you anything you want 
And I'll make it so easy for you' 
All I know is what my mama told me 
I know is what she said 
"When Beelzebub is sneakin' up on, you 
Best be dancin' on his head" 
Yeah, Lord, do the devil's stomp 
Oh he made it sound so good 
Stealin' my soul every way 
The devil's price hangs on my soul 
Throw a pocket full of gold his way 
* Repeat Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh glide to the shimmer 
Of the moonlight house 
I feel so good, you know to be so bad 
You've been holdin' back, baby 
For much too long 
And I feel it creepin' right in my bones 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh Lord, Lord 
Do the devil's stomp, do it
