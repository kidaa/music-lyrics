Standin' here. I got my eye on you 
you sort of please but there's no review 
On a trip and set my soul on fire 
Stealin' hearts, got me walkin' a wire 
*You're gonna lose control 
All night long 
When I find my love, love, love 
High wire 
Life's a smile on your shiny plate. 
Everyone laughing, she got it made 
Sorry, child, can you take mer 
But you keep me hangin' 
On your lonely wire 
* Repeat 
Oh feels so good 
You give me lovin' like no one could 
You turn me, child, inside out 
Still you leave me drownin' 
In a sea of doubt 
You're gonna lose control 
All night long 
You're gonna steal my soul, mama 
You can't go wrong 
When I find my love, love, love 
High wire 
Love, love, love 
Oh, sweet child 
I know where you come from now 
High wire, baby. oh no
