Living on a... 
It's the season and I'm insane 
Living on a... crazy scene 
Laughing through the morning sunshine 
Rolling in the rain 
Is alI need, is all I need 
Ridin' on the Wings of thunder 
Blinded by a bolt of Light 
I'm rollin' like a river full of hunger 
Oh I'm dancing on the edge tonight 
Now mama says it's all right 
But I'm leavin' it all behind 
If mama says It's all right 
It's a fine with me 
Runnin' through a distant thunder 
In a summer's rain 
Is all I need, is all I need 
* Repeat 
Living on a... 
It's the season and I'm insane 
Living on a... crazy scene 
I'm never never 
Never lookin' back in my time 
Gotta keep on movin' 
Do you know what I mean 
You know what I mean 
Ridin' on the Wings of thunder 
Blinded by a bolt of Light 
I'm rollin' like a river full of hunger
