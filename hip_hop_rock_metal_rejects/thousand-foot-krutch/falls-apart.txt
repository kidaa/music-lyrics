[Chrous]
It falls, apart, from the very start, it falls apart, seems like everything i touch, falls
aparty, everything around me, falls apart, when i walk away from you.

i wish i could but i dont, always keep the promises i've kept, i wish i could, but i can't,
always give, whatever i have left, and now its all so clear, doesnt anyone see whats happening
here?

[Chorus]

I know i should but i don't always say, what you want me to say, i know i could but i don't
always act, like everything's ok, and now its all so clear, doesnt anyone see whats happening
here?

[Chorus]

Everything I, have ever been made of, hates who i am, I'm so glad you waited, can't get my
mind, off how you could love me, i'm so behind, you're so far above me, and you'll always be
the wind under my wings, above me

I will not let it go to waste, I'm takin all, i got, and leavin' this place, and i, will not,
be takin' up space, i'll take my best shot, i'm pickin up the pace

[Chorus]
