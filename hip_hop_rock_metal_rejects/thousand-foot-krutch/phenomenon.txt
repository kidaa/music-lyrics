Verse 1
If you're like us, calling all riders,
Roll up beside us, no place to hide us,
All freedom fighters, let's unite us,
Switch on your nitrous, .and..let's..go

Destination, for navigation,
Man up ya stations, feel the sensation,
Surround invasion, with communication,
Move quick, we might, avoid contamination


Chorus
Down, here comes the sound,
Everyone pound, your feet, to this phenomenon,
Now, let's make it loud,
Let's show 'em all how, you move to this phenomenon
Roll! Open you soul, maybe lose control,
inside of this phenomenon,
Just, let yourself go,
and let everyone know,
you move to this phenomenon


Verse 2
Don't let these spiders, crawl up beside us,
They want to bite us, and inject the virus
Raise up your lighters, praise to the righteous,
We need you to guide us,
get..prepared..to..go
If you're like us, calling all riders,
All freedom fighters, let's unite us,
Switch on your nitrous, ..and..let's..go


Chorus

Bridge
Can't take it anymore,
Shake until we move the floor,
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!
I'm tired of bein' ordinary,
Don't care if there's people staring,
I'll rely on Your strength to carry me on
I'm not invisible like you,
next time things get a little messed up,
I'll shine, but I'll never be see through,
I'm fine, just tryin' to wake the rest up


Chorus
