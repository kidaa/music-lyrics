Verse 1
Dear loved one please listen
This might be the last chance I get
I'm sorry I left you
I'm living in a world of regret
Don't cry if you can hear me
I never meant to hurt you, dearly
I'm so wrong sincerely
Don't stop take life seriously.


Chorus 1
These are the last words
I'm ever gonna get to say to you
When everything falls away from you
Take these words and know the world
Is not worth leaving.


Verse 2
There's so much I've done wrong
Since I left it hit me so strong
Take my hand and let's walk through
All the times I've lied and hurt you
Those people, please love them
Don't hate them, we're not above them
You can everything but have nothing
Listen I've got to tell you something.


Chorus 2
These are the last words
I'm ever gonna get to say to you
When everything falls away from you
Take these words and know the world
Is not worth leaving.
Last words
I'll really get to say to you
So listen very carefully
To what I'm saying
Life is more than just the games you're playing


Bridge
If there was ever one thing
I could ever get across to you
I'd tell you not to say the things you do
And tell my mother that I love her too
No matter what life pulls ya through NO
You've got what it takes to make it through
And if I was you I'd get down on my knees and pray
Thank God in the morning for another day


Cause these are theto Chorus 2


Life is more than just the games you're playing
