It's a rodeo
Welcome to the big show
Round 'n round 'n here we go
Can't take it anymore

Hey, let's get it started
Show me how ya really want it
I'll give ya what ya need
because you're a part of me

And you, constantly move
Even though you disapprove
It's just what you do
It's the way you touch me

I'm alive, because you touched me
Take away the things that crush me
No one else can save me like you do
You're in human
I'm alive because you gave me
Time enough to shake this hate and
Take it all away, just like you do
You're in human

Hey, let's get it started, show me how ya really want it
Let's turn it up, rip it down and burn it up
Hey, let's get it started, show me how ya really want it
You're a part of me, I wanna give ya what you need

And you, constantly move
Even though you disapprove
It's just what you do
It's the way you touch me

I'm alive, because you touched me
Take away the things that crush me
No one  else can save me like you do
You're in human
I'm alive because you gave me
Time enough to shake this hate and
Take it all away, just like you do
You're in human
Take it all away, just like you do
You're in human

Every day, every hour
All the pain, and the power
Every day, every hour
All the pain, and the power

Every day, every hour...of the day

I'm alive, because you touched me
Take away the things that crush me
No one else can save me like you do
You're in human
I'm alive because you gave me
Time enough to shake this hate and
take it all away, just like you do
You're in human
