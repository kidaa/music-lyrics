I'm too scared to move, too scared to lose
Tell me what I am supposed to do
I'm too close to see you, but too far to touch
And too many times I"ve not done enough

I'm too close to see you, too far to touch,
And too many times I've not done enough
I'm too strong to hurt you, but too weak to crush
I want to, oh, oh let's go

[Chorus]
Oh-oh let's go everyone out the door
When you hear it go, hear it go, hit the floor
Let's go everyone hit the floor
When you hear it go, hear it go out the door
Oh-oh, let's go hit the floor, oh-oh here we go, here we go

I'm too scared to choose, scared to refuse
Tell me what I am supposed to do?
I'm too wrong to be you, too right to blush
And too many times I've not done enough

Tonight I walk alone no matter where I've been
No matter whete I'm goin', I know
Green lights mean time to go
But I won't let htem in 'cause I might lose control
