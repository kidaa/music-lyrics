I need your breath to stay alive and make me feel this way
And I need your eyes to look inside and watch how we collide

One more time around and I don't think I'll be allowed
It's the time to tell you

Take me, make me, break,
Watch me get wicked and drop like a hand grenade
Take me, make me, break,
Watch me get wicked and drop like a hand grenade
What's up is comin' down
And I hope no one's around when it falls

I find it hard to take, sometimes I feel like I could break
And I hope you hear my prayer tonight
Can you hear my cries?

Take me, make me, break
Watch me get wicked like a hand grenade
Take me, make me, break
Watch me get wicked and drop like a hand grenade

Hey you, tell me what you want me to do
Explode like a hand grenade
Hey man, tell me what you want me to say
I'll drop like a hand grenade
Hey!
