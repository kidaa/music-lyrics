We sat upon your bed,
You've said the things you've said
And I cannot believe
That you seem so naive
We exchanged our poetry,
You seem to think a lot like me
I'll guess I'll just assume that we could talk about most anything
Then I ask have you ever felt abandoned?
Felt so lost that you were stranded,
Just like all the walls are closing in
And you were left inside
Have you ever felt like your days were numbered?
Stuck under a tree in thunder
Seems to be no way out
But there is One when in doubt

Ready for another day
Slowly watch you waste away
Having fun, being cool
Like we did in high school
Elementary romance
Feeling nervous at the dance
Crack a smile hold it down
Whatever the circumstance
Sex drugs had to be cool
All the things we learned in schoo,
Typical teenage machines
Anyone tell me what this means?
I could learn I could try
Never really had an alibi
Wish I did that's no lie
Everybody's asking

Why
When you feel like you could fly?
Gotta know I got the answer for you baby,
Drives you crazy it's not over
So much more to life then this

Things seem so hallucinary
In the corners of my mind they scare me
I know you never meant to desert me
Just like you never really meant to hurt me

Then I asked have you ever felt abandoned?
Felt so lost that you were stranded
Just like all the walls are closing in
And you were left inside
Have you ever felt like your days were numbered?
Stuck under a tree in thunder
Seems to be no way out
But there is One when in doubt
