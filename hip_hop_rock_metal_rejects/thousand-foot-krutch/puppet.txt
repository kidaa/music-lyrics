Gonna get this party started!
It's all around me, I can't wish this away, you so amaze me, you took
my monster away. x2
Wake me, c'mon and wake me up now, I want to cut off my strings
and break, loose of your control of me, cut your strings and be free
with me. x2
Bridge
Everybody, shake your body, lift your hands, stop frontin', your just a
puppet. x2
To all the marienettes
Chorus
If they say jump, how high ya gonna jump? and if they say run, how
fast ya gonna run?, all you perpetrators be walkin' round frontin', what?
You fakers afraid to stand for somethin'? x2
Why don't ya stand up 'n' break me off somethin'?
Ya wanna make it outta sight? Somebody wanna get live tonight? We
can hit that, flip that, settle the score, 'n' aint anybody rock a crowd like
this before, ya wanna make it outta sight? Somebody wanna get live
tonight? Like an earthquake, let it shake, make the floor vibrate, Krutch
y'all back to set the record straight.
All y'all people, listen, it's on, Krutch marauders, we on a mission, hittin'
ya with the ill ammunition, at war with the puppet master, I'll bring it on if
I had to, rip it 'n' leave the whole scene shattered, like chik, chik, chik blaow!
what ya think of me now, i'm lettin' my sawgs out, makin' it loud so hear me
shout, what? we be comin' laced with bass, hit the place with no trace,
when we rock the space.
Bridge
To all the people still sleepin'

Chorus x2
