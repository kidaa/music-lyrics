Verse 1
We come rushing through your stereo system,
into your ear canal, like the alignment of the solar system
Have you forgotten about the days when,
We just wanted to rock, 'cause we like it that way, and
No more hate, no more lies, no more politics,
So sick of fakes, who cry, over copied riffs,
This is the day, that we rise, and we conquer it,
Raise your mics to the sky, like apocalypse


Chorus:
Everyone Bounce, show me what it's all about,
Don't stand just Bounce, 'cause we're takin' over now
it's TFK, we rock the party,
and keep the party rockin'
In an old school way


Verse 2:
Situation restless, like someone tryin'
to sneek up on the guest list,
play for a team that's called "not to mess with",
And check out the scenario, let the sound ya hear, control your stereo
Turn it up, and let the people know,
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go,
this is the day, that we rise, and we Conquer it,
raise our mics to the sky, like apocalypse


Chorus 2:
Everyone Bounce, show me what it's all about,
Don't stand just Bounce, 'cause we're takin' over now
it's TFK, we rock the party, and keep the party rockin'
In an old school way
Bounce, show me what it's all about,
Don't talk just Bounce, get up and let it all hang out,
If you're feelin' hard to breathe, ya better just leave,
we 'bout to make it hotter than the third degree


Breakdown:
Let's brake this mold, can't let this hold us,
Build up Let's be soldiers, no longer let them control us,
Boys and girls, together we'll shake the world,
If you believe, then put it to the sky with me
If you agree, there's more to this then what we see,
And what we know, then bounce 'till ya lose control,
And grab a partner, we about to make this hotter,
turn up the heat, while we get this started


The time has come now shake up the dust until it settles in the sand


BOUNCE


Bounce! get up 'n', Bounce! wake up 'n',
Bounce! stand up 'n', let your spirit fly
