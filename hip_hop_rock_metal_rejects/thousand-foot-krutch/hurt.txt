Drop the ball, watch it fall far below
Suck you in, hold your breath
The undertow creeps in slow
Everyone owns a gun deep inside
It's just a matter of how much you let it slide

Drop the ball, watch it fall far below
Suck you in, hold your breath
The undertow creeps in slow
Everyone owns a gun deep inside
It's just a matter of how much you let it slide

Help me help you they wont be there
Help me help you they won't see

It hurts when you need me
And I can't break your fall
It hurts when you can't see
And it hurts

Drop the switch, scratch the itch, watch it grow
Inch by inch, the cutting board, watch it swing to and frau
Everyone carries one deep inside
It's just a matter of how much you let it slide

Wash it off, take the loss, let it go
Take it in, drink it up, we can just take it slow
Everyone carries one deep inside
It's just a matter of how much you let it slide

Help me help you they wont be there
Help me help you they won't see

It hurts when you need me
And I can't break your fall
It hurts when you can't see
And it hurts

It hurts when you need me
And I can't break your fall
It hurts when you can't see
And it hurts

And it hurts when you're lonely
And I'm standing right beside you there
And it hurt when you told me
That you told me that you tried this on your own

Hope you never hurt
Hope you never cry
Hope you never lose your way tonight
Hope you never crumble
Hope you never fall
Hope you never throw away the

Drop the ball, watch it fall far below
Suck you in, hold your breath, watch it swing

It hurts when you need me
And I can't break your fall
It hurts when you can't see
And it hurts

It hurts when you need me
And I can't break your fall
It hurts when you can't see
And it hurts

And it hurts
And it hurts
And it hurts
And it hurts
And it hurts
And it hurts
