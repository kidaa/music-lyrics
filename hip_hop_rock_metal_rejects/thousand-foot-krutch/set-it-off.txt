To all the people in the house tonight
Can you feel it?
To those who live under the street lights at night
Can you feel it?
Come on and check this out
We 'bout to set this off
Here come the drums
When I let loose
I come out blazing
I maintain manning all stations
Fully prepared for all situations
We blow tracks like shrapnel with the rap skill
Shoot to kill not for thrills I got an iron grip
That's the sound we make no mistake keep the flow on
Town to town and state to state
And yo we rock the set like an earthquake
Hold it tight too, and too I just saw
Strapped to my knife boots
We bump tracks like a fifteens the flavors me
And chill like lightning when it flows through my brain stream
Ready to fit the script twice when I get nice
Equally precise hits you open like head lice

This time around we're here to let it be known
Thousand Foot be the kings of this microphone
This time around we're here to let it be known
Thousand Foot be the kings of this microphone now

Out to all the people in the house tonight,
We're gonna keep on rocking till the broad daylight
So just listen to the sounds coming through this mic
Gonna do this right do this right

Now set it off
Just set it off right
Play it for your radio
Set it off
Just set it off right come on
Play it for your radio
Set it off
We just set it off right
Play it for your radio
Set it off
We just set off right
Play it for your radio

Fire it up like NASA
Rocking it to y'all ghetto blaster
You're quick we're faster
We got the skills to out last ya
My mentality stays open
And if everything's cool
I'm hoping
To leave this microphone smoking
Hope your ready
My whole team can rock steady
Making noise with my boys
And watching out for poison
My main objective's to stand for what I believe
Maybe hear the sounds of the guillotine

We drop hit electrify
And to all the weak minded till the next in line
Here we made it in our accord
Ready to spawn
Used to go on and on
But now we just drop bombs

Just keep on rocking and don't stop
Keep rocking and don't stop
Just keep on rocking and don't stop
Keep rocking and don't stop
Just keep on rocking and don't stop
Keep rocking and don't stop
Just keep on rocking and don't stop
Keep rocking and don't stop
