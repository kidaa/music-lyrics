I want it, i need it, i taste it, i breathe it, it fuels my aggression, and fuels all my
questions, i can not conceal it, it hits me, i feel it, it kills me, i bleed it, now i believe
it

[Chorus]
I, I want it, I, I need it, I, I, breathe it, you are the new drug, I, I, want you, I, I, need
you, I, believe you, you are the new drug

I want it, I need it, I trust it, I breathe it, It fuels my aggression, and fuels all my
questions, i can not conceal it, it drives me, i feel it, it fills me, i need it, now i believe
it

[Chorus]

Don't Hold your breath

[Chorus]

I want it, i need it, i breathe it, i want it, i need it, i bleed it you are the new drug
