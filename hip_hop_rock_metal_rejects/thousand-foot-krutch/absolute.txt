I've tried, to hide
But I can't sleep at night
Everything I think about
Makes me feel like a version of myself

They tell, their lies
And we all synchronize
Look to, the sky
Because it's almost over

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help
Cause we've got nothing

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help
Cause we've got nothing left to lose
I know, we've tried
This thing a million times
But put me out
Cause I'm on fire

Don't talk, if you
Are going to tell me the truth
Don't tell me you know
You've got everything under control

We can't have it all
But we can break the fall
This time I'm letting go
Cause I can't take it anymore

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help
Cause we've got nothing

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help
Cause we've got nothing left to lose

I know, we've tried
This thing a million times
But put me out
Cause I'm on fire
