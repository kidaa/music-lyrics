Intro

Throw up your rawkfist,
If you're feelin' it when I drop this

Verse 1

Show 'em how we blow the spot,
Let's make it hot,
Let's shock 'em with the bodyrock,
'Till the party stops
It's time to take it up a notch,
And keep it locked,
For all the headbangers in the parking lot
Here we come, if you're ready or not,
No time to talk, 'cause we on the clock,
Bringin? that Uhh, uhh, to your block
Let me show ya where we're comin' from,
It don't stop, from L.A. to New York,
Show me what you got now!

Chorus

All I know, is what it did take to make this,
All I am, is what it will take to break this
All I know, is what it did take to make this,
All I am, is what it will take to break this
Light it up now, light it up now

Verse 2

Try runnin' me down, keep runnin' around,
I'm fakin' you out, would ya just,
Make it what you want it to be
About to find out, what you're all about,
I'm callin' you out, won't ya just,
Set me free/X2 Chorus

Bridge
