And you can throw away your expectations now, and all the things u wouldn't say outloud,
theres nothing left to pick apart now, the cards are all down, and now you know the sound of my
heart when it hits the paper, theres no more mystery here, this is the last song

I remember when we first became a band, we'd drive all night and talk about the world, I
remember when we used to now and then sit and wonder where it all would go

This is the last song the last song
so everybody sing along, this is the last song

This is the last song the last song
so everybody sing along, this is the last song

And you can throw away your expectations now, and all the things u wouldn't say outloud,
theres nothing left to pick apart now, the cards are all down, and now you know the sound of my
heart when it hits the paper, theres no more mystery here, this is the last song

I remember when we first became a band, we'd set up in the bedroom practice all night long, I
remember when we used to now and then keep the neighborhood up from the sound of our guitars, I
remember when we'd all hop in the van, turn the radio on, we were off to see the world, we
could pretend to do it all again til the sun goes down cause this is all we know

This is the last song the last song
so everybody sing along, this is the last song

This is the last song the last song
so everybody sing along, this is the last song

I remember when we first became a band, we'd drive all night and talk about the world, I
remember when we used to now and then sit and wonder where it would all go

This is the last song the last song
so everybody sing along, this is the last song

This is the last song the last song
so everybody sing along, this is the last song
