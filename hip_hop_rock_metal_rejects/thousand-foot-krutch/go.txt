I know the way you feel
The way you view incompetence
So we have to remedy
Our extreme lack of confidence

I love the way you move
You cover me like oxygen
Touched by your innocence
We come to you with hearts open

I love the way you are
The way you move, the way you speak,
And I like the way you heal
The hole inside, that's incomplete

I know the way you feel
The way you view incompetence
I have to remedy
And make this up again

And when I feel this way, it's hard not to let...

[Chorus]
Go, when I feel, like I feel, the way I feel
Go, I"m into you, just help me find a way this time
Go, when I feel, like I feel, the way i feel
Go, let it grow, wind me up and let me go

I love the way you twist, the way you're so mysterious
We'll hav eto stay in line, to let you know we're serious
I know the way you've seen, the way your hands have covered me
Touched by your gratitude, I'll break the skin and come undone

Stand up, the itme is now
Look at the faces in the crowd,
Do you want to just be one?
Or will you choose to overcome?

Stretch, take off your hurt
Leave your anger in the dirt
No more feelings, let it work
Let the growing take over
