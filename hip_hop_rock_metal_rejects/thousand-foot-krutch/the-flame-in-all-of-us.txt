This world has taken me by storm, it makes me feel like running, this place is making me
transform until i feel like nothing. It the strength in you and me... that surrounds
everything, The way you look out for me, The way you burn.

It's the flame, in all of us, the same, that makes us feel this, falme, in all of us, the sae,
that makes us feel it.

We are the youth, of yesterday, we've brought you pain and sorrow, that's what they say, but
they paved the way we are the new tomorrow, it's the strength in you and me... that surrounds
everything, the way you look out for me, the way you burn.

It's the flame, in all of us, the same, that makes us feel this, flame, in all of us, the
same, that makes us, it's the flame, in all of us, the same, that makes us feel, this, flame,in
all of us, te same, that makes us feel it

It's the flame in all of us that makes, the change in all of us, that takes, the blame in all
of us, and still keeps it alive.
