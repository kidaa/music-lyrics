Verse 1

She fooled all of her friends,
Into thinking she's so strong,
But she still sleeps with the light on,
And she acts like it's all right on,
As she smiles again
Her mother lies there sick with cancer,
And her friends don't understand her,
She's a question without answers,
Who feels like falling apart

Pre-Chorus

She knows, she's so much more than worthless,
But she needs to find her purpose,
She wonders what she, did to deserve this

Chorus

She's calling out to You,
This is a call; this is a call out,
'Cause everytime I fall down,
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now,
And my hazard signs are all out,
I'm asking you, to show me what this life, is all about

Verse 2

He tells everyone a story,
Because he feels his life is boring,
And he lies, so you won't ignore him,
Because that's his biggest fear
And he cries, but you'll rarely see him do it,
He loves, but he's scared to use it,
So he hides behind the music,
Cause he likes it that way

Pre-Chorus

He knows, hes so much more than worthless,
He needs to find the surface,
Because he's, starting to get nervous

Chorus

He's calling out to You,
This is a call, this is a call out,
Everytime I fall down,
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now,
And my hazard signs are all out,
I'm asking you, to show me what this life, is all about

Bridge

Have you ever felt this way before?,
Cause I don't want to hide here anymore,
Take me to a place where nothing's wrong, and,
Thanks for coming, shut the door
They say someone out there sees us,
Well if you're real then save me Jesus,
Cause I've been this way, for far too long,
I wasn't meant, to feel alone

Chorus

Now I'm calling out to You,
This is a call, this is a call out,
Everytime I fall down,
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now,
And my hazard signs are all out,
I'm asking you, to show me what this life, is all about
show me what this life, is all about 2 times
