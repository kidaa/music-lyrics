This place is many things... but i'd never... call it home, its just a building in a city,
everywhere, i go, this place is many things... but i can't call it home, home is the voice that
i hear, every night on the phone, and ive done a few things, i wasn't proud of, might have said
a few things, that hurt you, but you're still the only one who fills me up, and every night
spent alone, was worth it.

[chorus]
you are my home, you are my everything, when i feel so alone, you are my home, you are my
shelter... when all my hope is gone

and i've seen many tings... but they don't look like home, they're just the bright lights from
a city flowing all night long, and ive seen many faces, but they all look the same, home is the
place you are and i just wanna let you know that i've done a few things, i wasn't proud of,
might have said a few things that hurt you, but you're still the only one who fills me up, and
all tears that we've shared were worth it.

you are my home, you are my everything, when i feel so alone, you are my home, you are my
shelter... when all my hope is gone, you are my home, you are my everything, when i feel so
alone, you are my heart, you are the one... when it all comes undone, when it all comes undone,
when it all comes undone
