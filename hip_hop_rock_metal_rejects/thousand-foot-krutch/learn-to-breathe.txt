Sometimes i just want to run away, from all the things you say to me, feelings are ok to me,
and i just want to find a place, where no one sleeps, we're all awake and take the time to get
away... i dont want to play these games, your strength has helped me make the change, catch me
if i fall from grace

i dont want to play your game, 'cause lonely was a safer place, catch me if i fall from grace

[chorus]
take the ime, to learn to breathe, 'cause some day we're going under, we did we, all fall
asleep? won't someone wake us? take the time, to learn to breathe, 'cause some day we're going
under, help us see, whats underneath

i'm not here to place the blame, 'cause although we're not, we're all the same, you lit a fire
when you called my name, uhh-huh

i don't want to play yor games, cause lonely was a safer place, catch me if i fall from grace,
uhh-huh

[chorus]

i wanna take you, wanna shake you, wanna make you feel like i do, i wanna take you, wanna
break you, wanna make ou know what it's like

i wanna take you, wanna break you, wanna make you feel like i do, i wanna take you, wanna
shake you, wanna make you know what it's like

i wont fight you, im not like you, i wanna make you see what i see, i wont fight you, im not
like you, i wanna make you feel... like i feel

[chorus]

you think you have it all figured out, you think you're onto something, i see you standing
there, acting like you have no idea what i'm talking about, you don't like the way i dress, you
dont like the way i talk, thats fine, cause nobody asked you, and next time you want to point
the finger, i suggest you look in the mirror.
