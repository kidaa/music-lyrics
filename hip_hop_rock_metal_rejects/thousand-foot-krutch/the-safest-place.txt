I'm convinced i've seen, an escape for everything, they might have different names, but
they're all the same but the secrets safe inside, alone, and dark it hides, and i'd ignore it,
but it won't go away

and all i feel is static, this beat is automatic, i've tried to kick this habit but every time
i grab it.

and i, won't be the safest place to hide, take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies,
and i, won't be your safest place to hide, lord, help me break these chains, i need to see the
light

and now i see the way, you've constructed me, taking all that was and throwing it away, now i
know it's just the flame in all of us, and i can burn this up or blow it away

and all i feel is static, this beat is automatic, i've tried to kick this habit but every time
i grab it.

and i, won't be the safest place to hide, take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies,
and i, won't be your safest place to hide, lord, help me break these chains, i need to see the
light

and all I feel is friction, i dont want it, i hate this addiction,
and all I feel is friction, i dont want it, i hate this addiction,
and all I feel is friction, i dont want it, i hate this addiction,
and all I feel is friction, i dont want it, i hate this addiction,
and all I feel is friction, i dont want it, i hate this addiction,
and all I feel is friction, i dont want it, i hate this addiction!!!

and i, won't be the safest place to hide, take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies,
and i, won't be your safest place to hide, lord, help me break these chains, i need to see the
light..

and i, won't be the safest place to hide, take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies,
and i, won't be your safest place to hide, lord, help me break these chains, i need to see the
light....
