In my temptation to walk away,
and through the endless troubled days,
there's a hundred million ways,
for me to release Your praise!
By and by, and through the tears,
things You taught me through the years,
my whole life was designed by You,
I never known anyone half as true.
Lift it up, lift it up, lift it up so You can see.
Lift it up, lift it up, lift it up from inside of me.
Lift it up, lift it up, lift it up so You can see.
Lift it up, lift it up.
So, I lift it, I said I lift it up to You,
and I'll never forget the times that we've been through.
So, I lift it, I said I lift it up to You,
and I surrender all of me to You, to You, to You,
everything I'll ever be, to You, to You, to You,
I surrender all of me. x2
