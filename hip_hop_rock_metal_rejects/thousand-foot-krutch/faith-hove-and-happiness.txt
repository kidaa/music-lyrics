Verse 1
Ev-ery-one, is up in my face,
Need to get, outta this place,
It's hard to see, with you in front of my face,
Just another perfect day
Acting like, they wanna talk to me,
So fake, yet so friendly,
My eyes can see, even the back of me,
Won't you just let me be


Chorus
'Cause Everyone, is falling away,
Feel like they're stolen from me,
Wish everything, didn't happen to me,
All I want is faith, love, & happiness
Everytime, one runs away,
Another one's returning,
I Wish everyone, could just see Your face,
Faith, love, & happiness


Verse 2
It seams everyone, is up in my space,
like it's the American way,
I run in case, somebody takes my place,
just another change of pace
I know you think, you know a lot about me,
But so many wanna doubt me, my eyes can see,
Even the back of me, won't you just let me be


Chorus


Bridge
Every which way I turn, Ive got,
The option of a million choices,
Every single word I say is,
Judged, by a million critics
Every which way you turn, you hear,
The sound, of a million voices,
Every single move you make is,
Torn by a million cynics
When will we all see the. light of day,
I don't know


Chorus
