I've met a lot of friends
I've been a lot of places
Hung out in Hollywood
With all the perfect faces
Girls with dark tans
Surfboards and Ray-bans
Sometimes I felt like I could
Hold the whole world in my hands
Until I met You
It was these things that made my day
But You changed my views
And I realized that there is more to life
Than a Chevrolet

And You say there's something different now
About the way I hold my head and I
I'm ready for it now
To line them up and knock them down

Come along now
Grab my hand I'll show you how
We can all get out of here
Well soon it'll all be getting clear
Take me break me you're never gonna shake me
There's a lot about me you don't know so don't doubt me
I was sent to let the world know
Wind me up and let me go
Told you I would never be truly artificial
Won't just back down sitting in the background
Never play your enemy you'll never see the end of me

It's ok if you need some time
You need some time to think
And it's alright
I won't walk the line
Until I see you blink
