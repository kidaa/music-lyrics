Verse 1

I've got things that make me feel,
Un-ordinary, not necessarily,
In need of therapy
And I know, things have been,
Slipping, loosening my grip,
How much closer until I'm bound to hit the
Ground, sound, the alarm,
but remain calm, My time is drawn,
never meant to cause anyone, No harm


Pre-Chorus

This time things will be different,
I promise, I really promise,
And this time things will be different,
And it grows, and grows, and grows


Chorus '

Cause it's, the way we talk, the way we walk,
The way, your words connect my thoughts,
The way we move!, The way we stand!
The way, our world is in Your hands
My life's just like a prison,
We shout, but no one listens,
We're set, all in position,
Use us, take us, break us!


Verse 2

Questions, running through my mind,
I'm falling behind, I never would of guessed,
This could happen to me,
This frustration, is all I see/
And you're taking me,
And you're breaking me, down,


Pre-Chorus

This time things will be different,
I promise, I really promise,
And this time things will be different,
And it grows, and grows, and grows Chorus


Bridge

It's coming to that point,
I'm down on my -knees,
I'm praying, you can, change my life,
And change me
I'll follow you there,
I've got nothing to lose,
Unwind me, heal my sickness,
Unravel this, and set me free Chorus
