Break
Well this goes out to everybody
Who came to swing when we rock this party
It don't matter if you 14 or 40
What we gonna do is just get this started
It's the Krutch brothers getting mad retarded
If you don't like it then disregard it
Stay true to what we believe we never parted
And we still rocking mics just like we started

When up comes down
Shake it like an earthquake
Turn a-round
Nothing can stop you
When up comes down
Shake it like an earthquake
Turn a-round
Nothing can stop you
Now

It stays on
Just like the stage we blaze on
Light it like napalm
Thousand Foot up in the maison
Holy terror prepare yourself for the storm
You know it's on when the Krutch drops the bomb yo
We can get the show on
Right here no fear
Rocking the party on
From the floor to the chandelier
Check the Word
Don't just settle for video
Can I get a yo?
Shake it down through the millennium

nai...nai...nai...nothing can stop you now
