Verse
Digging slowly, flowers growing,
Beautiful from inside me,
Overlooking mis-representation,
Of my findings
How we gonna come back to this?
How we ever gonna make a match to this?
Let's lay low, like a mattress,
They'll just be another one after this


Chorus
You could never stop,
This feelin I've got inside of me,
You could never fill these shoes,
Cause I refuse to lose,
I'm just ordinary me


Verse same as 1st

Chorus 2 times

Verse 3
Growin up as an adolescent,
So full of those questions,
Got me second guessin,
My mind with the message,
And the mention of my,
Pro-gression, Class is in session,
How long will we all keep guessin?
When youve never been,
It's so evident, from your grumbling,
Man, I wonder when, well talk
If you wanna talk, take the mask off,
We can rock, shake it off,
Shake it off, shake it off x2


Bridge
One, you can't make me feel this way,
Two, you won't make me run away,
You can't understand my chemistry,
so laugh if that makes me ordinary


Chorus

Bridge
