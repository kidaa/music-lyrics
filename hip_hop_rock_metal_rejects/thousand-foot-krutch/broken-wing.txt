Here comes an opening, she's gotta broken wing, if you can feel the sting, take care of
everything, if she can make a scene, i'll show you what i mean, she pack a loaded gun, set fire
to anyone, knows how to make 'em run, she's down on sixth street, shes's goin sixty, she'll
show you how to breathe.

i dont want to see, i dont want to be, i dont wanna be anyone, anymore i dont want to fake, i
dont want to break, i dont wanna say anything, anymore, everytime you walk away, i wish you'd
stay, instead of pushing further away, everytime i hear you say i just need one, to take this
pain away

you're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you
can walk away, sweet julia...

and I won't laugh, I won't look, I won't listen if you just get up, and I won't laugh, I won't
look, I won't listen if you just stand

Every time I lie awake, I wish i could take it all away, every time my heart breaks, I wish i
could make it all seem safe

everytime you walk away, i wish you'd stay instead of pushing further away, everytime i hear
you say i just need one, to take this pain away, you're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you
can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you can walk away, sweet julia...
