Verse 1

I've, I've been as far you can go,
I've learned a lot, I've learned a lot and now I know,
You're never gonna get me on the floor, again
I'm, I'm prepared to take you to the end,
Never, never gonna play your games again,
Bring your whole team and all your friends,
But I hope your listenin'

Pre-Chorus

Haunt me, .if you want me, .but I'll warn you,
If you ever step to me

Chorus

I, sometimes wish that I could fly,
Hold me tight in your arms tonight,
I'm sick of livin' inside a lie, alright
I, can't count the times I've tried,
Stand alone just to lift You high,
You're my answer to the question why why

Verse 2

I'm, I'm sick of letting you control,
Me and all the, places that I go,
I'm never giving in to you, again
Take, take another look at me,
Take another look, and tell me what you see,
All of these kats tryin' to get under my skin,
But they can't step over me

Pre-Chorus 2

You try to control me, but ya can't hold me,
You don't own me, If you ever step to me
Chorus

Bridge

I know it's not me, take a look inside me,
I'm sick of these ways, so sick of these games,
Couldn't see it 'till I multiplied you
Call me a freak, but I don't hear the words you speak,
I'm takin' control, just lettin' you know,
That I won't, get sucked in by you Chorus

Break

Haunt me, .if you want me, but I'll warn you,
If you ever step to me again
You try to control me, but ya can't hold me,
You don't own me, If you ever step to me
