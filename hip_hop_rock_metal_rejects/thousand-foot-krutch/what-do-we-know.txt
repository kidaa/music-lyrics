Pick up the phone, nobody's home, im all alone, we've all been here before, buy yesterday, i
saw a change, another way, as you walked out the door, its a twist, a little but, i'll admit,
but we're stronger than before, open up, we've had enough, we've had enough, now we're holdin
on... and waiting

[Chorus x2]
What do we know?
What do we know?
What do we know?
What do we know?
What do we know?
What do we know?
I'll tell you what they're all sayin'

We all try to be somebody, but the world around us makes it so cloudy, when, we are trust,
where we're supposed to, but the blood on their hands says we're not close to the answer yet.
but maybe if we pulled together, we could change a million live for the better, and maybe, if
we prayed a little more, we would stop, living in fear from the story, and everyone sings

[Chorus]

Every part is you, every part if me, raise your hands, and sing, tell them we can be, show
them who you are, show them you can see, raise your hands and sing, tell them we are free

[Chorus]

Every part is you, every part is me, raise your hands, and sing, tell them we can be, show
them who you are, show them you can see, raise your hands and sing, tell them we are free
