Verse 1 & 2
From in the middle of the room,
She hears the conversation moving,
Further from where she's going, without even knowing
Now, the vibrations in the floor,
Are getting closer to the door, and,
Is this the way you, let your problems drift away to


Pre-Chorus
I climb, so high, it blows me away sometimes,
See through, my holes, into this place I call my own
This time, I'll try, it's in the air tonight,
Sleep tonight, no more cryin',
'cause I've got you on my side


Chorus
I don't want you to be, anything at all,
I just want you to say, you love me,
I don't care, just stop living like this
I don't want to be, anything at all,
I just want you to see, who I am,
And stop the violence, no more silence


Bridge
I'm gonna show Ya I'm alive,
Breathing clearly for the first time,
Take me in Your arms,
Take me, to the, place where, You are
I needed time to clear my mind,
Keeping balanced on this line,
Was impossible, before I met You


Pre-Chorus
I climb, so high, it blows me away sometimes,


Breakdown
Sleep tonight, no more cryin',
'cause I've got you on my side Chorus 


Outro
I'll shout from the top of the rooftop singing,
I'm not afraid of the bed I lay in,
Listen to the sound of the voices ringing,
I can't deny it, no more silence
We'll shout from the top of the rooftop singing,
We're not afraid of the bed we lay in,
Listen to the sound of the voices ringing,
I can't deny it, no more silence
