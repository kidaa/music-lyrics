Hold up, oh no, who let them in the door, its a like a freak show, shake it like a photo,
hate, is only when you say not what you mean, and pain, is whats inside of me, not when you're
bleeding, i, will fall, i'll fall and take your breathe away, we could change it all and take
your breathe away

this anger changes me, it effects the way i see, effects every part of me, and makes you my
enemy, but when it falls apart, its like a brand new start, and i cant remember why i ripped
everything apart

i'm still my worst enemy, the world around me all can see what they want to see, i need some
help, because im still my worst enemy, no matter where i am, i'll still get the best of me, i;m
my own enemy

shake the world inside of me, until it cant be shaken, wake, the words inside of me,befores
it's all too late, i will fall, and take you breathe away, we will change it all and take your
breathe away

this anger changes me, it effects the way i see, effects every part of me, and makes you my
enemy, but when it falls apart, its like a brand new start, and i cant remember why i ripped
everything apart

i'm still my worst enemy, the world around me all can see what they want to see, i need some
help, because im still my worst enemy, no matter where i am, i'll still get the best of me, i;m
my own enemy

my own enemy... my own enemy
