Wanting, watching, debating, on which way to run to, haunted, voices, craving, someone to run
to, i haven't lost myself in a long time, i never tried to care when i wanted to, i just want
to be part of something, i just want to be real like you

[Chorus]
Sometimes, i feel like a monster, and times,  ifeel like a saint, i'm on my knees, you're my
favorite disease

Silent, warnings, tell me, that i've let things come, undone, show me, teach me, the way to
heaven, cause no other way can, i havent lost myself in a long time, i never tried to care when
i wanted to, i just wanted to to be part of something, i just wanted to be real like you

[Chorus]

Closer, closer, closer to you, i need to be closer, i have closure, and get closer to you,
every step i take...

[Chorus]

And i love the way you kill me, love the way you heal me, i love the way you kill me, love the
way you heal me, i love the way you kill me, love the way you heal me
