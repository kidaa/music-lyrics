Verse 1
Wait, I might hesitate,
Am I a minute too late?
Please Lord, I need to know,
This pressure's got me lettin go
If I'm wrong, will I still carry on,
And end up where I belong?
I've never felt this way, before


Pre-Chorus
I've never come so close,
I've never worn so thin,
I'm stepping out, instead of closing in
I left myself behind.
When I made up my mind,
No turnin back this time,
This is my new design


Chorus
Sometimes, I feel so alone,
It feels like I'm standing on my own,
And I've never, felt so far from home,
it's comin on, it hits me when I step
outside my zone 2 x's


Verse 2
I see, what youre doin to me,
'could of bin you so easily,
but you look the other way,
Even though we were close the other day
And Im still tryin to get up this hill,
I need you just like a pill,
And I've never felt this way before


Pre-Chorus


Chorus


Bridge
Do ya get the feelin', everything will be alright?
I'm mo-vin, so please to meet you,
But I-am-movin on, tried to pass it to another,
But its comin on, I cant wait to find out
Break-me, I can't seem to climb out,
Of-this, hole, I'm stuck again,
If I'm not out in a minute, Im jumpin in,
Let's start again
Im sick of this


Let's just, get it out, are ya feelin' it?
Move back, ya wanna feel how real it is? x2
Chorus


Sometimes I feel so a-lone!!!!!
