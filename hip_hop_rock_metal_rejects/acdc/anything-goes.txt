Got a taste of a rocking band,
Standing there holding out your hand,
Better lock up all your doors,
Shes like a spinning dynamo,
Youre handing out the token prize,
Giving you a brand new ride,

Ooh there she goes, she goes,
And nobody knows where she goes,

Banging drums, working out all fast,
Heavy tune I can play it loud,
You know shes blowing away all the others,
Youre never man enough take it on all night,
You better razzle dazzle on that stage,
Keep on rocking all through the night,

Ooh there she goes, she goes,
And nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes,

A heavy rocking tune is playing,
Playing as the night rolls on,
Sneaking off with the Romeo,
Where she goes, nobody knows

A heavy rocking tune is playing on a flat screen colour TV,
Sneaking over creepy crawly, never give it up to take it out through the night,

There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes
