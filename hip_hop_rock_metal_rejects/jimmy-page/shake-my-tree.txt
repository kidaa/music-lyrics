Now I don't want to be your slave,
You're trying to drive me to an early grave.
All I ever hear, is that you live an' breathe for me
But, all you ever do, babe, is shake my tree.

'Cos you keep on pushing, baby,
Like you never, ever been in love before.

I told you once an' I told you twice,
I ain't no schoolboy you can sacrifice.
You want my love an' you want it now,
You try to love me, baby, but you don't know how.

So you keep on pushing, baby,
Like you never, ever been in love before.

I need love an' I need time,
An' a little bit of both, if you wanna be a friend of mine.
I don't want no woman, drive me outta my head
An' you're the kind of girl, guaranteed to wreck my bed.

Love is what you need,
But, you cut down to the bone an' make me bleed.
I give you everything an' still you cry
Ooh, mama, the price of loving you is way too high.

But, you keep on talking, baby, I've heard it all before
Now I don't want you hanging around, or kicking at my door.

But, you keep on pushing, mama,
Like you never, ever been in love before.

I know love an' I know shame
An' I ain't gonna get caught up in your game.
It took a little time to make me see,
I ain't lookin' for a woman like you to shake my tree.

So keep on talking, baby, keep on hangin' around
Everything you do to me, is sure to drag me down.

An' you keep on pushing, mama,
Like you never, ever been in love before.

Shake my tree.

Solo

I don't want to be your slave,
You're trying to drive me to an early grave.
You keep on talking, no matter what you say
I've had enough of your kind of love, to last me all my days.

So keep on pushing baby, I've heard it all before
I don't want you hanging around, or kicking at my door.

Now I don't want your loving, baby, I can't take it anymore,
I don't want you hanging around, kicking at my door.
If I see your face again, I'll give you what's in store
But, you'll keep on pushing, baby,
'Cos you've never, ever been in love before.
