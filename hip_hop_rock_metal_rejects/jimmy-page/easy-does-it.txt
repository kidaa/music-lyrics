You said you needed love to warm you in the night,
So you gave yourself to strangers,
Who left you crying at first light.

You think the world you live in doesn't notice you
But, don't you worry, baby,
I'll be there to comfort you.

So take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.

So weep no more, my lady, don't you cry,
I can't paint your portrait with those tears in your eye.

But, I can give you love, every night and day
An' we will walk together,
The sun and moon will light our way.

So take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.

I'll tell you something you'll understand,
Grab a hold now, baby,
And I'll lead you to the promised land.

I'll make you feel so good, make you feel alright
Chase away the shadows and keep you warm at night,
Ooh, I'll keep you warm.

Take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.

Gonna keep you smiling and satisfied,
Nothing but blue skies on a magic carpet ride.

Take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.

Anywhere the four winds blow, I'll take you there.

Here we go, baby, hold on.

No more worry, no more pain,
The sun is always shining,
And it never, ever rains,
And it never, ever rains,
And it never, ever rains.
