My heart is breaking, my whole life is shaking.
Every way I turn, I know this love is gonna burn me
But, I'm waiting on you, no matter what you do.

Ever since you went away, I suffer each an' every day.
An' I can't hide the heartache anymore,
You left me all alone, just waiting by the telephone,
Too scared to step outside this prison door.

An' I'm waiting on you.

No matter what you say, no matter what you do,
This heart is dedicated to you.
'Til the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines,
I'm still gonna make you mine.
I'm waiting on you, waiting on you.

Ever since I started drinking, my ship's been slowly sinking,
So tell me what's a man supposed to do.
When people stop and stare and see me drowning in despair,
'Cos it's written on my face, what I've been going through.

An' I'm waiting on you.

No matter what you say, no matter what you do,
This heart is dedicated to you.
'Til the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines,
I'm still gonna make you mine.

I'm waiting on you, waiting on you.
I'm waiting on you, waiting on you.

Solo

My heart is breaking, my whole life is shaking.
Every way I turn, I know this love is gonna burn,
Love is gonna burn, love is gonna burn.
Burn me, baby, burn, your love is gonna burn.

Ever since you went away, I've suffered each an' every day
An' I can't hide the loneliness no more.
All the tears I've cried, all the love I've been denied
An' still you find me waiting on you, baby, baby, babe.

No matter what you say, no matter what you do,
This heart is dedicated to you.
'Til the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines,
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you.
My heart is dedicated to you,
An' I'm waiting on you, waiting on you.
No matter what you say, no matter what you do,
This heart is dedicated to you.
'Til the rivers run dry,
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you.
My heart is dedicated to you,
An' I'm waiting on you, waiting on you.
No matter what you say, no matter what you do,
My heart is dedicated to you.
'Til the rivers run dry,
I'll be waiting on you, babe.
