The first thing in the morning, the last thing at night,
I just wanna hold you, babe, and make you feel alright.
When the sun is shining, or the sky is filled with rain,
Wherever we may be, I'm gonna make love with you again.

Now I don't need a crystal ball to tell me it's true,
'Cos I've crossed too many rivers on my way to finding you.
Your smile, like a summer sun, can brighten my day
And when I'm feeling down, you chase the dark clouds away.

There ain't no doubt about it, baby,
I'm gonna shout about it.

Take a look at yourself,
Can't you see why I want you and nobody else.
'Cos the first thing in the morning,
The last thing at night.
I just wanna hold you, babe,
An' make you feel alright.

Sometimes I feel it in my bones, when the cold northwinds blow
But, when you put your arms around me, I can feel it no more.
I've been guilty of a thousand crimes in matters of the heart
But, just the thought of losing you, tears me apart.

There ain't no doubt about it, baby,
I'm gonna shout about it.

Take a look at yourself,
Can't you see why I want you and nobody else.
'Cos the first thing in the morning,
The last thing at night.
I just wanna hold you, babe,
An' make you feel alright.

Solo

There ain't no doubt about it, babe,
I'm gonna shout about it.

Take a look at yourself,
Can't you see why I want you and nobody else.
'Cos the first thing in the morning,
The last thing at night.
I just wanna hold you, babe,
An' make you feel alright...
