Hey!

Hey, gypsy woman, roll your dice for me,
Read my Tarot cards, so I can see.
I'm razor sharp, cool sunglasses,
Pocketful of backstage passes.
Lady Luck, roll your dice for me.

The boys are feeling hot, tonight,
Fingers crossed, they get it right.
Women to the left, women to the right,
The boys are feeling hot tonight.

I ain't too proud to beg for what you got,
You'd melt a heart of ice, babe, you're so hot.
So pump it up, raise the dead,
Squeeze it, honey, 'til it's cherry red
I ain't too proud to beg for what you got.

The boys are feeling hot, tonight,
Fingers crossed, they get it right.
Women to the left, women to the right,
The boys are feeling hot tonight.

Feeling hot, feeling hot, feeling hot, feeling hot, hot, hot, hot.

Solo

Feeling hot.

Now I just wanna make sweet love to you,
I'll do anything you want me to.
So rip it up, slip an' slide,
'Scuse me if my tongue gets tired
An' I will make some sweet love to you.

The boys are feeling hot, tonight,
Fingers crossed, they get it right.
Women to the left, women to the right,
The boys are feeling hot tonight, hey, hey, hey.

Look out baby!

The boys are feeling hot tonight,
The boys are feeling hot tonight,
The boys are feeling hot tonight.

Rip it up, baby.
