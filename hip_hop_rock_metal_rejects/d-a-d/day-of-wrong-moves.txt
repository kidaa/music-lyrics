Yeah! I wake up; beaten, wrappen around the T.V.
Strange I was in bed when I slept...
And the tooth-paste's weird
'Coz when I try to talk; I blow a bubble instead
I got one shoe one'n'the other one's gone..
And my head's in the box full of bread...
Yeah! I know I've been tricked
- And I hate to admit
- I should've stayed in bed!
But I'll grit my teeth'n'take it
'Coz it's a day of wrong moves
I just know I've been chosen
To a day of wrong moves
On a day of wrong moves
A bad morning has broken
To a day of wrong moves

And my feet walk out; from under my brain
Like a high-wire artist I fall!
I keep forget; that I'm a neighbourhood threat
God's not polite at all
These days come without a warning
There must be a sign on my roof
It took a while just to see..
- That someone's pickin' on me...
And try to burn my fuse
But I grit my teeth'n'take it
Hey! It's a day of wrong moves
I just know I've been chosen
To a day of wrong moves
Yeah! A day of wrong moves
A bad mornin' has broken
To a day of wrong moves

I'm 6 feet tall with 20 movable parts
On a day of wrong moves
And sometimes they mess up'n'this is how it starts...
On a day of...
Yeah! Turn the radio on and up!!.
Hey!! I'm gonna call up work and say I'm dead!
That's a wrong move
Turn on the T.V. and forget
But that's a wrong move
Call up the cops'n'confess!!!
No that's a wrong move
'Coz I'm out on the wrong side of the bed!!!!
Hey, that's a wrong move
- But whatever I do; I have to make it through
A day of wrong moves
- I just know I've been chosen
To a day of wrong moves
Yeah, a day of wrong moves
A bad mornin' has broken
To a day of wrong moves
Hey! I'm 6 feet tall with 20 movable parts..
On a day of wrong moves
- And sometimes they mess up...n this is how it starts
On a day of...
On a day of wrong moves YEAH!
