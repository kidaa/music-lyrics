I had a ticket to fly so I boarded the plane
When a combat dressed stewardess shouted my name
I'm wanted alive yeah! I'm in for a trial
It's minimum mercy 'coz they've found my file
Hijacked and kidnapped 'n trailed and trapped
They fly me in I'm gonna pay for all my sins -- Now it begins
Yeah! I've found a place where girls eat men
Now I'm back in girl nation again

Girl nation
Female civlization
Girl nation
Female civilization

It's a female tale it's hard to use words
But I'm landed and stranded among oysters
