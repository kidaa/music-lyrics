In a heavy-metal box
Where I was kept from I was little
It had locks on both ends
And a foodtray in the middle
I could smell my fans
- But I couldn't hear them shout..
So I did a lot of thinking...
- And this is was it's all about:
How much trouble can you make?
- And how much shit can you take??
Riskin' it all..
You kill yourself for peanuts
Riskin' it all...
With R'n'R in mind - but still..
Riskin' it all...

Don't need no average savage to kill my will!
The choice between light'n'shade
Are out beyond the bizarre
I mean why waste an outfit
Among strangers in a bar
- U see when I'm drunk
- I'm an original punk!!
Riskin' it all...
Yeah! You kill yourself for peanuts
Riskin' it all...
Under the metal-law; but I will not!
Riskin' it all...
With R'n'R in mind; but still..
Riskin' it all...

Don't need no average savage 2 kill my will!
Riskin' it all...
Yeah! You kill yourself for peanuts
Riskin' it all...
Under the metal-law; but I will not!
Riskin' it all...
With R'n'R in mind; but still..
Riskin' it all...
Don't need no savage average to kill my will!
