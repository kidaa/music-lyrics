Yeah, c'mon!
Hey, there's nothing I hate in.
No, there's nothing I hate in..
- There's nothing I hate in the world like waitin'!!
And there're things in life I'd hate to be late in-
Yeah! I look at my watch'n'look at my wrist..
- And then I punch myself in the face with my fist!.
I blew out of bed to make it
- Tomorrow's today'n'it's already here..
It's like a disease; I can't shake it...
- Why don't we get this motor in gear?.
A smart boy can't tell ya'!

5 o'clock come and 5 o'clock's gone...
And the large and the little moves steadily on...
This has gone to far; we gotta rewind
- Or it's a 4 fisted brainstorm in the group-mind!
Yeah!
- See I'm so tired of waitin'
I build it up so big in my mind..
We've filled the places we've played in!
- How come we never make it on time?.
A smart boy can't tell ya'!
I'm always the 1st and they're always too late!..
A smart boy can't tell ya'!
- Did I pick the wrong day; did I pick the wrong date??
A smart boy can't tell ya!
Aren't u happy to see us; we're only 3 hours late!!
Yeah!
A smart boy can't tell ya!
A smart boy can't tell 'a!!
A smart boy can't tell ya!!!
C'mon! Look at your clock; - I think we've waited enough
A smart boy can't tell 'ya!
I blew outa bed to make it

Tomorrow's today'n'it's already here!.
It's like a disease; I can't shake it...
- Why don't we get this motor in gear?.
A smart boy can't tell ya!
