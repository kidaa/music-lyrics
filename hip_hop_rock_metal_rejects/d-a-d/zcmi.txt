Say if you see a vicious lightnin' on the nighttime sky
There's no use to check the starmap or ask daddy why
And if you get me on the wire, I'll give you this reply:
See I'm comin' higher 'n' higher over chimneypot 'n' spire

ZCMI -- Yeah! I'm that high flyin' guy
ZCMI -- And when the moon sails by
ZCMI -- Yeah, I smile and wave goodbye
ZCMI

Beyond the end of space to the future and back
In search of solid ground to plant our flag
Yeah! We'd like to build a base but the sky is too black
See I'm comin' higher 'n' higher over chimneypot 'n' spire

ZCMI -- Yeah! I'm that high flyin' guy
ZCMI -- And when the moon sails by
ZCMI -- Yeah, I smile and wave goodbye
ZCMI

ZCMI -- Surrender or die!
ZCMI

ZCMI -- I'm that high flyin' guy..
ZCMI -- Yeah! I smile and wave goodbye...
ZCMI -- When the moon sails by....
ZCMI -- Yeah! I'm the ZCMI
