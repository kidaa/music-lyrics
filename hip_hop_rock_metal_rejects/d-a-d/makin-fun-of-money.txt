Yeah! See the milk's in the fridge
And it's turning into cheese
If I'm so smart; how come I ain't rich?
- No one knows'n'no one sees...
My moral compass went out of course
And I ran aground
U gotta watch how you get...
- But what the hell what the heck!
-- I mean, I wrote out the check!!
It ain't the money you got / No it's the money you spend
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
- See it's already a mess
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
The Visa's, Diner's'n'Master, Express

The cold hand of currency
Grips my heart at night
Right now it's raining unpaid bills
From an unknown height..
Though the story ain't that funny
There was once when I had money
I act like I got it / Pretend I know
- It's minus 500,000...
It ain't the money you got.. / No it's the money u spend
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
See, it's already a mess
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
The Visa's, Diner's'n'Master, X-press...
- Makin' fun o' money
It's the D.A.D.'n' the I.R.S.
Yeah! I ain't got no hot water
And the cold's running thin..
I keep conversations from a public phone
- In this place I call home; I'm livin' in...
Makin' fun of money
 $'n'all...
Makin' fun of money
All rolled up in a ball..
Makin' fun of money
And with a tremblin' hand:
Makin' fun of money
- I pay what I can
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
- No, it's already a mess
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
The Visa's, Diner's'n'Master, X-press
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
The D.A.D.'n'the I.R.S.
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
Yeah! It's already a mess
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
No'n'I know; 'Coz I tried it!?
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
- It ain't funny no!!
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
- I'm way behind
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
It ain't funny makin' fun of money
