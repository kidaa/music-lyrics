Heart and clock slows down...
And the sand reverberates with a tremelous sound
On a diet of water and thick air
I inhale the heat and exhale my share
Barometer's climbin' up their scales
Heat shimmers and the horisont sails...
I wouldn't know 'bout the governments policy
But the waterhole-water looks like coffee!
Time stopped'n'heart slowed
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down-down-down that dusty road
Down-down-down that dusty road
Down that dusty 3'rd world road

A full 20 miles wide..
Lies glowin' pebbles'n'nothing beside...
And man starts to boil
Can't help being born above a lake of oil
The distant battles don't shoot blanks
- Soon it's goodbye'n'many tanks
The long shadow used to read like poetry
- Now the waterhole-water looks like coffee!
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down-down-down that dusty road
Down-down-down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down-down-down that dusty road
Down-down-down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down-down-down that dusty road
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down-down-down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down that dusty 3'rd world road
Down-down-down that dusty 3'rd world road
- Walkin' thick soled
Down-down-down that dusty 3'rd world road
Yeah! Down!!
To the road turns to sand...
