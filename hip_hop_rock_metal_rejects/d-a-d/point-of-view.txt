Yeah, you like a man when his mind is strong
When his ego's so high he couldn't be wrong
You like a man when he's right at the top
When his ego is growing and it don't seem to stop

See I'd like to share your point of view
As long as it's my view too
Can't win on a compromise I'd rather lose on my own
'Coz I fell kind of good when I'm all alone

And you play the games by the book and the rules
See, I play 'em backwards -- Let's see who lose
Yeah, you don't go for the man, you go for his balls
So let's see who stands, let's see who falls

Yeah, I'd like to share your point of view
As long as it's my view too
Can't win on a compromise I'd rather lose on my own
Cuz I feel kind of good when I'm all alone
And if I take a stand it will be my own
And take it yeah!

Yeah!!
Shhhhhhhh... Take a look in these eyes
Do they look sincere? Do you read my lips
Do I make it clear? Bye bye so long,
I don't want you here

Yeah, I tried to share your points of view
If not all, then maybe just a few
I couldn't win on a compromise
I'd rather lose on my own
'Coz I feel kind of good when I'm all alone
And if I take a stand it'll be my own
Get out of my heart.
And my mind..
And my home...
