There was a real thin line
Between right or wrong
In those Walt Disney times
When my parents were young..
But the line has disappeared...
And you wonder where it hides....
And you wanna go out; but you stay inside.....

I got run over by truth one day
Didn't see the red light
Since the accident I've walked this way
- I only did what felt right...
But from this day on; it's either: grow or pay!
Grow or pay
'Coz I got run over by truth one day

Sometimes the sky's so grey
That you cannot see beyond it
And even the wildest of dreams
- Can't take those lines from your forehead
Yeah! I know there's a bill
- And it's gonna make it's way somehow
With and excuse and a bow; I'll be paying it now:

I got run over by truth one day
Didn't see the red light
Since the accident I've walked this way
- I only did what felt right...
But from this day on; it's either: grow or pay!
Grow or pay
'Coz I got run over by truth one day
Grow or pay
From this day on it's either: grow or pay
Grow or pay

Grow or pay
I got run over by the truth one day
And since the accident I've walked this way
Didn't see the red light
But from this day on; it's either grow or pay!

Grow or pay
'Coz I got run over by the truth one day...
