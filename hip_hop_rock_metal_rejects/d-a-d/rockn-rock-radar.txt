We played this part of this song for a year
Now all we need is a little singing...
And it's gotta be great 'coz it ruins my ear
When the guitar-wall is ringing..
Hey! We've been circling the airport
To give what we've got; and still some...
To small to be seen'n'to big to control
- Treated like a walkin' bomb
To doom-de-doomsday
Even if we start today
- Wel'll be big in L.A.
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
Comin' on a low frequency
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
A stain on the screen is all they'll see

Ass'n'trouble some one broke a string
- But who cares - We have an aeroplane yeah!
It takes more than a budget to keep us away
- It's the; "Bound to entertain-ya-mania"!!
With international niceness
On recycled vinyl'n'tape
Yeah! With a new rage; We'll find backstage
Press our bellybuttons'n'escape...
- To doom-de-doomsday.
- Even if we start today..
- We'll be big in L.A.
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
Comin' on a low frequency
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
A stain on the screen is all they'll see
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
And go ahead! - Call emergency!!
Rock * Rock ** Rock *** Rock'n'rock radar...
Comin' on a low frequency

Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
A stain on the screen's all they'll see
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
You're too small; You need backin' up!
Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
- And if the radar's mistaken - you'll be big in Copenhagen!!
