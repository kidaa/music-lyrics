In my travelling heart, there's an urge to see
Foreign lands and alien birds and new stories that no one heard
To stick a pin in the globe and to believe and hope
There's a whole new world to unravel
As far as a boy scout can travel..

Company of adventurers
On the secret track
Caesars of the wilderness
Around the world
