I have my hair high and low anywhere the wind blows
I'm doing M.P.H. anywhere my soul goes
I'm Hell riding and gasoline feed
That's all I need for the lift that I lead

I'm a true believer, yes I am
You try to get me if you can

Yeah! I'm riding alone and I've drugged my senses
There's no one else to take the consequences
See when the day is gone free
