I'll start your day with a shock
See one of these days 'bout 12 o'clock
The world will turn into a little rock
And it's going to fall down with the sound of a knock
I'm one of these guys who's nice to know
'Coz I know a face to go
It's just down the generation gap
I'll take you there in a red hot cab

And if you want I mean you really really want
I'll show you my hometown and it's down
Yeah, you can tell by the smell
So close you can hear 'em yell

They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Oh lord let me live to tell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell

And meet your hosts
Lift your glass for a toast
Don't be afraid of the colors he wears
Look around all your friends are here
Now don't say you've had enough
Stay awhile stay tough
Grab his horns like you just don't care
We'll eat the fire and drink what's there -- yeah!

'Coz if you want -- I'll take you down, down..
I mean you really really want, I'll show you my hometown...
Let's stay until the end -- the very end!
And to be saved by the bell
So close we almost fell

They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Yeah! You can tell my the smell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell

To the edge and back and to the edge again
Too hot for the D.J. and too hot for his friends

C'mon party!!

They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Yeah!!!
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Oh lord, let me live to tell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Please, I can't stand the smell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
