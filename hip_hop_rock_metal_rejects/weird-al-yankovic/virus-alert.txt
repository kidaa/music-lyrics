Hey, everyone, listen up, your attention if you please 
We wanna give you a warning 
'Cause I found out this morning 
About a dangerous, insidious computer virus 
If you should get it, an email with the subject, 'stinky cheese' 
Better off protecting your chances 
Under no circumstances, should you open it 
Or else it will 

Translate your documents into Swahili 
Make your TV record "Gigli" 
Neuter your pets, and give you laundry static cling

Look out! 
Erase your hard drive and your backups too 
And the hard drive of anyone related to you

Soon, very soon, it will make all the paint peel off your walls 
It'll make your keyboard all sticky 
Give your poodle a hickey 
And invest your cash in stock in Euro Disney 
Then, it will tie up your phone, making prank long-distance calls 
It'll set your clocks back an hour and start clogging the shower 
So just trash it now, or else it will 

Decide to give you a permanent wedgie, 
Legally change your name to Reggie, 
Even mess up the pH balance in your pool 

Look out! 
It's gonna melt your face right off your skull 
Look out! 
And make your iPod only play Jethro Tull 
Look out! 
And tell you knock-knock jokes while you're trying to sleep 
Look out! 
And make you physically attracted to sheep 
Look out! 
Steal your identity and your credit card 
Look out! 
Buy you a warehouse full of pink leotards 
Look out! 
Then cause a major rift in time and space 
And leave a bunch of Twinkie wrappers all over the place 
That's right it's a

If you get infected, you'll wish you had never been born 
So before it emails your grandmother all of your porn 
Turn off your computer and make sure it powers down 
Drop it in a forty-three-foot hole in the ground 
Bury it completely; rocks and boulders should be fine 
Then burn all the clothes you may have worn any time you were alive!
