When we were young, Bernie's Deli was down the block
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
He made a great liver pate
You know he did, you know he did, you know he did
But if there's one thing in this world that I like better
Than a corned beef on rye

It's Chicken Pot Pie
Chicken Pot Pie

[chorus of chicken-cluck imitations]
