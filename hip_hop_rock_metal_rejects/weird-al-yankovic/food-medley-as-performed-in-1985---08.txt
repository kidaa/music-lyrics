I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool.
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school.
Yeah, but chocolate's gettin' old,
Vanilla just leaves me cold.
There's just one flavor good enough for me, yeah me!
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon, I know what I need.

Baby, I love rocky road,
So won't you go and buy half a gallon, baby
I love rocky road,
Now have another triple scoop with me!
Ow!
