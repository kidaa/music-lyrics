It feels like I've been alone too long,
With no girls around 
My mamma's wondering.
Thinking of some way,
to release it.

I looked in the kitchen,
Saw some Crisco Oil,
And that's when my bladder started to boil,
Ooooooh yeah.

Ow, Ow, Ow!
Uh oh!
Ow, ow, ow!
Oh God!  What did I just do

No one wanted to be with me,
Had to make my dream come true,
I wanted to hump something,
I didn't know what to do.
It seemed like a good idea,
And no one else was around,
I stuck my weenie in a bottle,
And now I can't get it out!

Stuck my weenie in a bottle today,
Gonna shove it up there all the way.
I stuck my weenie in a bottle, 
Oh no,
Can, can, someone come help me out

It's turning purple,
All the feelings gone,
Now where did I put that friggin' phone
Dialing 9-1-1!

Please pick up!
I'm in a lot of pain!
This was supposed to feel good,
Now I'm suffering,
Oh, please answer!
