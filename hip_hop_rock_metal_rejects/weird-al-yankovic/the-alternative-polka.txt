'Loser' by Beck 
Soy un perdidor 
I'm a loser, baby 
So why don't you kill me 
Soy un perdidor 
I'm a loser, baby 
So why don't you kill me 

Hey! 

'Sex Type Thing' by Stone Temple Pilots 
I am I am I am 
I said I wanna get next to you 
I said I'm gonna get close to you 
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you, too 
Hurt you, too 
I know what's on my mind 
I know you like what's on my mind 
I know it eats you up inside 
I know you know, you know 
Here I come I come I come I come 
Here I come I come I come 

'All I Wanna Do' by Sheryl Crow 
All I wanna do is have some fun 
I gotta feeling I'm not the only one 
All I wanna do is have some fun 
I gotta feeling I'm not the only one 
All I wanna do is have some fun 
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard 

'Closer' by Nine Inch Nails 
Help me--I broke apart my insides 
Help me--I've got no soul to sell 
Help me--The only thing that works for me 
Help me get away from myself 
I wanna [doink] you like an animal 
I wanna feel you from the inside 
I wanna [clong] you like an animal 
My whole existence is flawed 
You get me closer to God 

Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 

'Bang and Blame' by REM 
You bang bang bang bang bang 
Blame blame blame 
You bang bang bang bang bang 
It's not my thing so let it go 

'You Oughta Know' by Alanis Morisette 
'Cause the love that you gave 
That we made 
Wasn't able to make it 
Enough for you to be open wide 
No 
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me 
You'd hold me until you died 
'Til you died 
Well, you're still alive 
And I'm here to remind you 
Of the mess you left when you went away 
It's not fair to deny me 
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
You-ou-ou-ou-ou oughta know 

Hey! 

'Bullet with Butterfly Wings' by Smashing Pumpkins 
Despite all my rage 
I am still just a rat in a cage 
Despite all my rage 
I am still just a rat in a cage 
And someone will say 
What is lost can never be saved 
Despite all my rage 
I am still just a rat in a cage 

'My Friends' by Red Hot Chili Peppers 
I love all of you 
Hurt by the cold 
So hard and lonely, too 
When you don't know yourself 

'I'll Stick Around' by Foo Fighters 
I don't owe you anything! 
I don't owe you anything! 
I don't owe you anything! 
I don't owe you anything! 

'Black Hole Sun' by Soundgarden 
Black Hole Sun 
Won't you come 
And wash away the rain 
Black Hole Sun 
Won't you come, won't you come 
Black Hole Sun 
Black Hole Sun 
Won't you come 
Black Hole Sun 
Black Hole Sun 
Won't you come 
Black Hole Sun 
Black Hole Sun 

'Basket Case' by Green Day 
Do you have the time 
To listen to me whine 
About nothing and everything all at once 
I am one those melodramatic fools 
Neurotic to the bone 
No doubt about it 
Sometimes I give myself the creeps 
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me 
It all keeps adding up 
I think I'm cracking up 
And am I just paranoid 
Or am I just stoned 
Or am I just stoned-oh-oh-oh-oh-ned 

Hey!
