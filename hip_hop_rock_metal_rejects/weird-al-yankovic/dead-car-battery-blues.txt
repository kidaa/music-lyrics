One, two, a-one, two, three, four

Well I, can't go to the park
I can't go to work
I can't do nothin'
I gotta stay in my house like a jerk

How come I always lose
My car has blown a fuse
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues

You know, can't visit my girlfriend
I can't go to school
I can't go anywhere
Gotta stay in my room like a fool

'Cause I got grease in my hair
My Belvedere's in disrepair
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues

So I, went to see my mechanic
He said, "Okay, now what is wrong"
I told him my car wouldn't start
He said, "This shouldn't take very long"

So he replaced all my plugs and my points
And he looked at my carburetor
He took out my engine and turned it around
And then seventeen hours later

He looked at my headlights and said
"Son, how long have these things been on"
I told him, "Oh, about three or four weeks"
He said, "Buddy, I know what's wrong"
"But I hate to be the one to give you the news"
"You got the dead car battery blues"

So now I, can't go to my office
Can't work on my job
I might as well lock myself up in my room
And live my life like a slob

How come I always lose
My Belvedere has blown a fuse
Oh yeah
I got hydraulic fluid leakin' in my shoes
And the dead car battery blues
