I had a pizza,
Covered with cheese.
I wrapped it all up in aluminum foil,
Stuck it back in the freeze.

Look at my crust now,
See what I mean.
It's getting all wrinkled,
And my pepperoni is hairy and green.

Ah, 'cause it's moldy now,
It got moldy fast.
How can I
Make leftovers last, make leftovers last

I was so hungry,
What could I do
I finished the pizza
And topped it all off with some mystery stew.

Now I feel kinda queasy,
Yeah, yeah, what can I say
So I called my physician
To wish him that he'd make a house call today.
