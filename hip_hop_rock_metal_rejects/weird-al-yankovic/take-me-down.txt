Someday I'm gonna pack up
And then I'm goin' back up
To that place where sentimental feelings arouse

Where the grass is so green
And the air is so clean
That when the wind is right you can even smell the cows

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today

If you're new in town
Then you'll wanna look around
But you don't know where to begin
Well, there's Bubble Gum Alley
And the local car rally
Not to mention the toilets at Madonna Inn

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today

It's not much of a hassle
To drive up to Hearst's Castle
And it's not too far from Pismo Beach or Morro Rock

You can visit downtown at your leisure
Because for your shopping pleasure
The stores never close down until five o'clock

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away

Take me down take me down
To that good old SLO town
I've got to get back
To that city today
