Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a %$@& if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing's all right, nothing is fine
I'm running and a-crying

Wake up Wake up
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup

You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die, die, die
D-d-die die die die die
Hey

I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free

Do what I want 'cause I can
If I don't because I wanna
Be ignored by the stiff and the bored
Because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so, all right
Do believe I told you so
Now it's all out and you knew
'Cause I wanted to

Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love at once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading

Can't think of anything to do
Yeah, my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Yeah, I said it once before but it bears repeating, now

Last night, she said
"Oh baby, don't you feel so down
When you turn me off
When I feel left out"

So I what'd you do?
Well, I turned around right around
"Oh, baby, gonna be alright"
It was a great big lie big old lie

'Cause I left that night
Yeah

Ooh ah ah ah ah
Ooh ah ah ah ah

Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Get up

Open up your hate and let it flow into me

Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up
Come on get down with the sickness

Get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

But I'm on the outside

I can see through you
See your true colors

'Cause inside you're ugly
Ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you
