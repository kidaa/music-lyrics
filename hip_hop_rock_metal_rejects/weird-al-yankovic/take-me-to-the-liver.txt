I'd like to do some more songs about buildings and food
This is a song about liver, very high in protein, very good for ya
Hope you like it

I don't know why
You feed me so bad
Think of all the health food
I could've had

You took-a my yogurt
And my whole wheat bread
You give me Ding Dongs
And Twinkies instead

I wanna know
Can you tell me
When is it going to end

Take me to the liver
Push it on my platter
Give me a piece of liver
Oh, drop it on my platter

Scarfin' it down
Scarfin' it down
