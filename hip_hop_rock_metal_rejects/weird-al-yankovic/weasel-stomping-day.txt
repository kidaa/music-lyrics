Faces filled with joy and cheer 
What a magical time of year 
Howdy Ho! It's Weasel Stomping Day 

Put your Viking helmet on 
Spread that mayonaisse on the lawn 
Don't you know it's Weasel Stomping Day 

All the little girls and boys 
Love that wonderful crunching noise 
You'll know what this day's about 
When you stomp a weasel's guts right out 

So, come along and have a laugh 
Snap their weasely spines in half 
Grap your boots and stomp your cares away 
Hip hip hooray, it's Weasel Stomping Day 

[Sounds of weasels getting stomped on, with bone-crunching and rodent-screeching effects] 

People love them down the street 
Crushing weasels beneath their feet 
Why we do it, who can say? 
But it's such a festive holiday 

So let the stomping fun begin 
Bash their weasely skulls right in 
It's tradition, that makes it okay 

Hey everyone, it's Weasel Stomping 
We'll have some fun on Weasel Stomping 
Put down your gun, it's Weasel Stomping Day 
Hip Hip Hooray, it's Weasel Stomping Day 

Weasel Stomping Day 
Hey!
