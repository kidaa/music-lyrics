Oooh oooh oooh ee-oooh oooh oooh 
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh-oooh oooh 
Oooooh 

I'm always thinkin' 'bout it 
I don't know what I'd do without it 
I love, I really love 
My pancreas 

My spleen just doesn't matter 
Don't really care about my bladder 
But I don't leave home without 
My pancreas 

My pancreas is always 
There for me 
Ahh-oooh 

Secreting those enzymes bap bap bap 
Secreting those hormones too 
Metabolizing carbohydrates 
Just for me 

Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba 
My pancreas 
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba 
My pancreas 
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba 
My pancreas 
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba 
My pancreas 

Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba 
My pancreas 
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba 
My pancreas 
Ooooooh 

My pancreas attracts every other 
Pancreas in the universe 
With a force proportional 
To the product of their masses 
And inversely proportional 
To the distance between them 

Woo woo woo woo
