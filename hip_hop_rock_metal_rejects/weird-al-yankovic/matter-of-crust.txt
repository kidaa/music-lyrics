Some bread, you can get bargain-priced
And every loaf you buy begins with a singular slice
But you know it will go stale again
Always does, its just a question of when

I've lived long enough to have learned
The longer it stays in the toaster, the more it gets burned
But that can't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of crust
