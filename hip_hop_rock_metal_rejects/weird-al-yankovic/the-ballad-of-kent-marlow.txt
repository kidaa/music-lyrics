You did a really rotten thing
And let Scout take all the blame
You wrecked his reputation
And left that poor boy in shame
Yeah, but now I think it's time
To show who really did the crime
Kent Marlow, you're a dirty, lyin', worthless hunk of slime

Kent Marlow, you're a dirty, cheatin'
Lyin', no good, lousy, stinkin'
Back stabbin', scum suckin', worthless hunk of slime
