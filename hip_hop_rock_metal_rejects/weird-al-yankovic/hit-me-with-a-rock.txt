When I was a little boy
When I was just a boy
And my mother would call my name
When I was just a boy
She'd say I had to be in the house by seven
When I was just a boy 

But I'd stay out late at night
When I was just a boy
And when I'd finally get back in
Oh, I know she'd hit me, she'd hit me
She'd sit me on her knees and whip me

Oh, she'd hit me with a rock
She'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
She'd hit me hit me with a rock
She'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with a rock

And when I was grown to be a man
Grown to be a man
The minute the boss would call my name
Grown to be a man
And say I had to be in the office by seven
Grown to be a man

I'm a constipated man
Grown to be a man
And when I'd finally get back in
Oh, my boss'd hit me, he'd hit me
He'd tie me to a chair and whip me

Oh he'd hit me with a rock
He'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
He'd hit me hit me with a rock
He'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with a rock

When I was grown to be President
Was the President
The minute the congress'd call my name
Was the President
And said some papers had to be signed by Thursday
Had to be signed by Thursday

I'd fly away to Pakistan
Was the President
And the second that I'd get back home
Oh, I know they'd hit me, they'd hit me
With leather and chains they'd whip me

Oh, they'd hit me with a rock
They'd whip me with a rock, oh baby
They'd hit me. Hit me with a rock
They'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with a rock
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with a rock
They'd hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with a rock
Yah yah yah yah yah yah
Hit me with a rock
Hit with a rock
Ow, whaddaya doin' to me, get away from me
Hit with a rock, oh baby
Hit with a rock
He's gettin' hit with a rock
He's gettin' hit with a rock, oh baby
Hit with a rock

Wait a minute, hold it
I think he's dead
Let's leave
Let's get out of here, man
