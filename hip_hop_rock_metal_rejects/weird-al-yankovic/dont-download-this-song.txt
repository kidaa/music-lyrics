Once in a while 
Maybe you will feel the urge.
To break into national copyright law
By downloading mp3s
From file sharing sites
Like morphous or grogster or limewire or kazza. 
But deep in your Heart.
You know the guilt would drive you mad
And the shame would leave a permanent scar
Cause you start out stealing songs
Then you're robbing liquor stores
And selling Crack
And running over school kids with your car

[Chorus]
So Don't Download This Song 
The record store is where you belong 
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should 
Oh Don't Download This Song

Oh you don't want to mess 
With the R I Double A
They'll sue you if you burn that Cdr.
It doesn't matter if you're a grandma
Or a seven year old girl
They'll treat you like the evil Hard-bitten criminal scum you are

[Chorus]
So Don't Download This Song don't go
Pirating music all day long  
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should 
Oh Don't Download This Song

Don't take away money 
From artists just like me
How else can I afford another solid gold Hum V 
And diamond studded swimming pools  
These things don't grow on trees 
So all I ask is everybody Pleaseeeeee

[Chorus]
Don't Download This Song Don't do it No No
Even Lars Urlich Know it's wrong You could just ask him
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should You Really Should
Oh Don't Download This Song

Don't Download This Song Oh please don't you do it or you
Might Wind up in Jail like Tommy Chong Remember Tommy
Go and buy the CD Right Now like you know that you should Go out and Buy it
Oh Don't Download This Song.

Don't Download This Song No no no no no no
Or you'll burn in hell before to long  And you deserve it
Go and buy the CD Just buy it like you know that you should You should get it
