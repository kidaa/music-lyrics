It's rotten
So rotten here
So rotten
Oh

It was like, the last day before trash day
My place was gettin' kinda nas-tay
Even though the garbage I knew would reek
You know Thought that I could leave it for one more week

Then, um, I'm takin'
Birthday cake 'n'
Oh Chili and greasy old bacon
Throw it all on top of the mess I been makin'

Wife's so mad, she starts to shakin'
Leaky bag, 'n' now that girl is gaggin'
She's naggin'
"I need you to get that stuff off the kitchen floor"
"Is that too much to ask for?"

But I see no reason why
Can't let a few more weeks go by
And now garbage is piled high
And buddy, you should see the flies
I said ...

There's somethin' rotten here say what?
You better hold your nose, oh uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out
Oh, boy there's a lot in here a lot
And every day it grows uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out
Make ya wanna throw up

Look at all this garbage I keep generatin'
Come on I sit around all day and watch it biodegradin'
Bet there's a hundred health codes that I'm violatin'
Even my dog passed out and needed resuscitatin'

You won't believe it, take a whiff of that aroma
Sure to put you in a coma
It's so messy, can't find my toenail clippers
It so bad the roaches wearin' slippers

Warm, sweaty clothes piled up in this joint
Stand up by themselves at this point
It's so filthy, now baby, I can't lie
I wipe my feet before I go outside

I wonder what crawled in there and died
You know Walkin' 'round barefoot, I'd be terrified
But it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends
Like, "Hey, I think them rats gettin' big!"
Oh

There's somethin' rotten here say what?
You better hold your nose, oh uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out
Oh, look what we got in here now what?
Let's watch it decompose uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out

Make ya wanna throw up
With a little bit a ***, and a little bit a ***
Make me wanna throw up
It makes ya wanna ***, just makes ya wanna ***
Oh

Some Lysol, some Comet
I got a mop and it's got your name on it
What? I'm just kiddin', doggone it
Oh Unless you gonna do it

Careful not to breathe the fumes
Check it, garbage piles are goin' all the way to the bathroom
Turn into toxic waste sometime this afternoon
Better get a Hazmat suit and a push broom
Oh

There's somethin' rotten here say what?
You better hold your nose, oh uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out
Oh, it's gone to pot in here to pot
Bring out the firehose uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey, you disgusting slob, you gotta take the trash out

Make ya wanna throw up
With a little bit a ***, and a little bit a ***
Make me wanna throw up
Give a little bit a ***, and a tiny bit a ***

Make ya wanna throw up
Mix a little bit a *** with a molecule a ***
Make me wanna throw up
It makes me wanna *** aw, eww, just makes me wanna *** [spit]
Oh
