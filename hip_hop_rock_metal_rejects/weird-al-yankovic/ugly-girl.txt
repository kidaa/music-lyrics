[Ken]
Wanna go for a ride

[Barbie]
Sure Ken!

[Ken]
Well forget it!

[Barbie]
I'm an ugly girl, my face makes you hurl
Said I have it, I should bag it!
Acne everywhere, unwanted facial hair!
I'm a relation to Frankinstein's creation!

[Ken]
Your so ugly,
You disgust me!

[Barbie]
I'm a sad,
Homely girl,
All alone in the world
I'm as flat as board
Thin and lengthy

[Ken]
You're a doll
Get a troll
Were you hit by a train
Don't come near me 
'Cause your breath is stanky!

[Barbie]
Don't get touched!
I'm afraid!
'Cause guys say,
I'm an eye sore!

I'm an ugly girl, my face makes you hurl
Said I have it, I should bag it!
Acne everywhere, unwanted facial hair!
I'm a relation to Frankinstein's creation!

[Ken]
You're so ugly,
You disgust me!

[Barbie]
Boo hoo, hoo, yeah!

[Ken]
You're so ugly,
You disgust me!

[Barbie]
Boo hoo, boo hoo!

Oh let's go out and have some fun!

[Ken]
I'm sorry, 
But you're too damn ugly!

[Barbie]
Oh, screw you, Ken!

Acne everywhere,
Unwanted facial hair,
I'm a relation to Frankinstein's creation!

[Ken]
You're so ugly,
You disgust me!

[Barbie]
Boo, hoo, hoo, yeah!

[Ken]
You're so ugly,
You disgust me!

[Barbie]
Boo hoo! 
Boo hoo!

Oh let's go out and have some fun!

[Ken]
I'm sorry,
But you're too damn ugly!

[Barbie]
Oh, screw you, Ken!
