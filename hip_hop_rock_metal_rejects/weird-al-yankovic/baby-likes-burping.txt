You know my baby likes burping
You know my baby's kinda nauseating

[burps]

My little vulgar one is so gross
'Cause when I hold her in my arms so close she goes

[burps] 
And out in public it's embarrassing
She'll burp at anyone or anything
She's so revolting and disgusting
And repulsive to me, yeah

My little lady's so obnoxious
Today she walked onto a Greyhound bus goin'

[burps]

And then a couple hours later
My baby's in a crowded elevator

[burps]

That little filthy pig is so obscene
I'm really glad she doesn't like beans
She's so revolting and disgusting
And repulsive to me, yeah

Oh, I wonder what's her trip
Oh, she'd better can it quick
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick

If baby does it anymore
I think I'll just pretend like I don't know her

[burps]

You know my baby likes burping
You know my baby is really sickening

[burps]

That's enough, that's it

[record scratch]
