one, two, thray, four
one, two [nasal hocking sound]

I used to be a pinball freak
That's where you'd find me every week
But now it's Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

I love to gobble up those dots
Keep pumpin' quarters in the slots
They call it Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

At the game arcade, they say I'm hard core
I can play all day 'til my hands are sore
And I quit my job just to play some more
But I won't give up 'til I break high score

Pacman [music from Pacman "intermission"]

Well it's the Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

Well it takes a lot of cash to play
Pacman, get the cherry
So I'm gonna sell my house today
Pacman, eat 'em up

I'm playin' Pacman
Yeah it's the Pac-ma-an

Hey mom, I won't be home this year
Pacman
Please forward all my mail right here
Pacman
I'm at the Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

And you're playing with no one but me
Pacman
