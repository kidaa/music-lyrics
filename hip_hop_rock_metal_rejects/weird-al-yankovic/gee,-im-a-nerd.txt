Gee, I'm a nerd
Seen each Star Trek eighty times
Memorized each word

Home alone
On Friday nights
But I got eight gigabytes
Left on my hard drive

I'm hooked as I can get
Into the Internet
Maybe you would like to see my web page

I love my new PC
It means the world to me
So many things to download

Gee, I'm a nerd
All the jocks and muscle heads
Flip me the bird
Cause I'm a nerd

Gee, I'm a nerd
