Hello, this is "Weird Al" Yankovic.
You know, some of my favorite memories are those of Christmastime. 
I still remember when I was a little boy, just waiting for the big day. 
Mom would be cooking up a mess of boysenberry and tunafish burritos 
for our big Christmas dinner, and dad would be decorating the tree with little bits of Spam. 
And then, the big day would finally arrive. 
I'd stay up all night and wait for Santa, 
a-and when he finally showed up, 
we'd all hold his hands down in the waffle maker until he promised 
to give us everything we wanted! Ah, yeah, those were the days. 
Well, Merry Christmas everybody, and, let's do lunch.
