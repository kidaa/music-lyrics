Uh, sleep all day, out all night,
I know where you're going.
I don't that's a-acting right,
You don't think it's showing.

A-jumpin' up, fallin' down,
Don't misunderstand me.
You don't think that I know your plan,
What you try'n to hand me?

Out all night, sleep all day,
I know what you're doing.
If you're gonna a-act that way,
Think there's trouble brewing.
