Dogs is dogs
Chickens is chickens
You can break my heart
But it keeps on ticking away
Can't you hear what say
You can play your game
But this old dog don't play

A hog is a hog
A guinea is a guinea
Your old love
It ain't worth a penny to me

If you could only see
That this old dog don't need your company
Why don't you leave my heart alone
I don't roll over
Don't fetch no bone
I don't need your love now anyhow

Ain't you got better things to do
Than try and make me act for you
I don't dance no jig and honey
I don't chase nobody's cow

A snake is a snake
A lizard is a lizard
Loving you's a lot like sleeping in blizzard alone
Lord, I wish you were gone
Well you can keep on playing
But I ain't playing along

Why don't you leave my heart alone
I don't roll over
Don't fetch no bone
I don't need your love now anyhow
Ain't you got better things to do
Than try and make me act for you
I don't dance no jig and honey
I don't chase nobody's cow

A snake is a snake
A lizard is a lizard
Loving you's a lot like sleeping in blizzard alone
Lord, I wish you were gone
Well you can keep on playing
But this time I ain't playing along
