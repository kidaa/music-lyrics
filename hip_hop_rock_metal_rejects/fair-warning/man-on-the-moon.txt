Chorus:
Do you wanna be in love forever
Do you wanna make my dream come true
Let me be the one to kiss and hold you
Say you'll be my baby
Can you see the two of us together
Living in love this whole life through
Do you wanna be in love forever
Say you'll be mine

I can remember
When my mind was clear and free
Now there's a feeling
Coming over me
The sweetest attraction
That my heart has ever seen
I'm going crazy making sense of anything

Repeat Chorus Twice

I really wonder
Is there magic in your smile
Taking me under
Got me acting like a child
Something about you
Hits me like avalance
I try to stand my ground
But I don't stand a chance

Repeat Chorus

Every time I close my eyes I deram about
Hugging you, holding you, kissing you boy
It's driving me crazy
But even if it takes forever
To win your heart and your love and your devotion
I know it's gonna be worth the wait

Ooh, say you'll be my baby
Ooh, be my baby
Ooh, oh darlin', say you'll be mine

Repeat Chorus

Do you wanna, do you, do you wanna
Do you wanna be in love
Do you wanna, do you, do you wanna
Say you'll be my baby
Do you wanna, do you, do you wanna
Do you wanna be in love
Do you wanna, do you, do you wanna
Say you'll be mine

Repeat Chorus
