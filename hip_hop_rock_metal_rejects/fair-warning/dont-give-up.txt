I feel so alone

Again

I know that I need you

To help me make it through the night

And I pray

That you believe in me

You gave me my strength

To face another day alone

I need you now

My friend

More than you know yeah yeah

When will we meet again

Cause I can't let go

Of you

This world brings me down

Again

I know that I need you

To help me make it through the night

And I know that you're the one

For me

You gave me my strength

To face another day

And I know

I need you now

My friend

More than you know yeah yeah

When will we meet again

Cause I can't let go

I can't let go

As time passes by so fast

Things never seem to change

When I feel alone

You bring me back to you

And I need you now

My friend

More than you know

When will we meet again

Cause I can't let go

Of you

No I can't let go
