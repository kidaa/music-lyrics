There's those who turn their nose up
When we play our music loud
Those folks would love to take control
And turn our volume down
But we come from the country
And we live by the code
That if it feels good; we're gonna do it
There ain't no middle of the road

And no one's gonna tell me
How to live my life
'Cause it's my life
And it ain't nobody's business
What kind of flag I fly
'Cause that's my right

We just love what we're doing
You can hear it in our songs
We ain't gonna break
Ain't gonna bend
We're just carrying on

It's a sign of the times, everybody trying
To be politically correct
But worrying 'bout what other people think
Will make you a nervous wreck
Well we're just here to tear the house down

With the many or the few
There ain't no law against having a ball
And that's just what we'll do

And no one's gonna tell me
How to live my life
'Cause it's my life
And it ain't nobody's business
What kind of flag I fly
'Cause that's my right

And no one's gonna tell me
How to live my life
'Cause it's my life
And it ain't nobody's business
What kind of flag I fly
'Cause that's my right
