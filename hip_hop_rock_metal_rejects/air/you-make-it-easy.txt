Never been here - How about you ?   
You smile at my answer, 
You've given me the chance, 
To be held and understood. 

You leave me laughing without crying, 
There's no use denying, 
For many times I've tried, 
Love has never felt as good. 

Be it downtown or way up in the air, 
When your heart's pounding, 
You know that I'm aware. 

You make it easy to watch the world with love, 
You make it easy to let the past be done, 
You make it easy. 

How'd you do it ? How'd you find me ? 
How did I find you ? 
How can this be true ? 
To be held and understood. 

Keep it coming - no one's running 
The lesson I'm learning 
'Cause blessings are deserved 
By the trust that always could 

Be it downtown or way up in the air, 
When your heart's pounding, 
You know that I'm aware. 

You make it easy to watch the world with love, 
You make it easy to let the past be done, 
You make it easy. 

You make it easy to watch the world with love, 
You make it easy to let the past be done, 
You make it easy.
