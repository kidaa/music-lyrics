Whenever my mind sees you girl
I think of the times we owned the world
Crazy in love I missed the signs
I just couldn't see
I never believed you were leavin' my life

Chorus # 1 
Baby give us one more chance
So we can love again
There's a time for love, a time to heal
Now it's time for us to mend


Chorus # 2 
Baby give us one more chance
Let me come back home
I don't wanna run the endless road
Or fight this world alone


You were the diamond in my life
You were the only star in sight
Playin' against the odds I lost
All that I had
Oh what was the cost of you leavin' my life


Repeat Chorus # 1 
Repeat Chorus # 2 


Give us one more chance
It's all that we need
To let the heartache mend girl
And make a love once broken
Strong again


Repeat Chorus # 1 
Repeat Chorus # 2
