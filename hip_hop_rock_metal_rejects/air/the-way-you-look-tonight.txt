I like the way you look tonight 
No blood in your vein, what does it mean ? 
Trashy art everywhere, on the screen 
Slow motion aftertaste, I've had foresight 

That's the way you look tonight 
I like the way you look tonight 

Free union rider in the sun 
Here comes the lord of audio beauty 
Do you really have a digital body ? 
People like you grim, lust for fun 

That's the way you look tonight 
The way you look tonight 
I like the way you look tonight 
The way you look tonight...
