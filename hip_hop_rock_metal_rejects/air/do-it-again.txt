I used to watch you walk away
Till the road you take would bend
I was the man to turn you on
And you knew it after all
Come tomorrow when I'm all weary
You would turn me down again
At least that's the way I can remember

Chorus 
Do it again, Do it again, Do it again
Do it again, Do it again, Do it again


Every single word you told me got home
I'm still thinking about them
Every little secret we should have known
And we can't live without them


You surely started something
You surely gave me something new


Chorus 

And I do think about you each now and then
And each time it gets tighter
From the road I can see the last break
And my head's getting lighter


You surely started something
You surely gave me something...you


Chorus 

You surely started something
You surely gave me something ...you


Chorus
