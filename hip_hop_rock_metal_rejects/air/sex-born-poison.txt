Shoot,use your gun of life 
I'm not afraid to die 
In your arms 
Shoot,use your gun of life 
Keep on watching me 
Poison me 
MESAMEDASU Prince from the biomass 
AI YOKU NO NAMI NI OYOGU 
KANA Eacute: YO HOLO BI NA KI AI 
DEMO IMA WA JIKAN GA NAI 
YOKUBO NO sensor KAWASU AI NO juice 
DO KASEN NI HI WO TOMOSO 
HASHILE HIJOGUSHI LEIKYAKU system on 
TODOKAZALU NANABAN ME NO SOLA 
Who dares to wake me? 
Prince from the biomass 
Swimming in the waves of your intimacy 
I'm able t offer 
My love for centuries 
But I have no time right now 
Meet my desire sensors 
My atom juice of joy 
You want to use my affective circuits 
Run to the fire exit 
Use your cooling system 
You'll never reach the 7th sky today
