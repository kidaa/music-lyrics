Here on the streets
tears and the sea
a passional make

Life carries on
the cloak of the seed
brings all that to share
and a voice i used to know
where are you ?
is the one i can't let go

chorous:
you are the reason
my faith in tomorrow
a distant horizon
the one i must follow
you are the first
you are the last ,to me

translated
And in the dark
i am lightened ,for you
for whats the truth ,
understand, what we must do
yes its true
we won't be apart

your's trust is what i believe in
your's trust is what my life is
you are my breath
you are my heart beat
my darling its only you

you are the spell that has been cast

chorous:
you are the reason
my faith in tomorrow
a distant horizon
the one i must follow

translated
your's trust is what i believe in
your's trust is what my life is

you are the first
you are the last

you are to me
you are
