I'm a high school lover, and you're my favorite flavor.  
Love is all, all my soul.  
You're my Playground Love.  

Yet my hands are shaking.  
I feel my body [remain tense?], no matter, I'm on fire.  
On the playground, love.  

You're the piece of gold the flushes all my soul.  
Extra time, on the ground.  
You're my Playground Love.  

Anytime, anyway,  
You're my Playground Love.
