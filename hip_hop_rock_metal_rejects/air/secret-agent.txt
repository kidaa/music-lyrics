Well I've got friends in the States 
And I've got friends out in space
When information's your game
The whole world knows your name
And so they gave me a code
To work this treacherous road
For all the agents I know
Must work incognito

Chorus 
I love my trade, 
I've got my future made. 
I put my life on the line 
To save this country of mine
And they reward me with love
And see I have a good time. 
So all my moves must be fast
Cos every day is my last
A secret agent that's slow
Almost certain to go. 


Chorus 
I've got friends in the States
I've got friends out in space
When information's your game
The whole world knows your name
And so they gave me a code
To work this treacherous road
For all the agents I know
Must work incognito. 


Chorus
