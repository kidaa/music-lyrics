When I wake up in my house 
I get dressed when I get lost 
I don't know which way to go 
I guess I'll have a cup of Joe 
where the hell was I anyways 
so I end up on the street 
walkin' talkin' to my own beat 
in a fog, in a haze 
I've been trippin' out for days 
can you help me find my way home 
1-2-3 
don't rock the boat now, just let it slide 
groovy people walking back and forth, that's right 
so I hop onto this bus 
destination reads please save us 
not a soul that know 
to be found in this dark hole 
can you help me find my way home 
can you help me find my way home 
I'm so tired of looking for the door 
please help me find my way 
please help me find my way 
I can't find the door 
where I am now, where I am now 
I find myself just out there floating
