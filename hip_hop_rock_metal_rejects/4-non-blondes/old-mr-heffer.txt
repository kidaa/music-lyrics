Stumbled my way on the darkest afternoon 
I got a beer in my hand and I'm draggin' a stoagle too 
the back of my brain is tickin' like a clock 
I simmer down gently but boil on what the f 
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight 
get back 'cause I'm feelin' right 
Trouble is a word that stars with a capital T 
I refer myself to the word 'cause I'm so keen 
little do they know that I'm struttin' such a style 
it makes the trouble in me all worth the while 
So get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight 
get back 'cause I'm feelin' right 
There goes Billy and Susie walkin' hand by hand 
I quickly caught up slurring yo what's the plan 
they had fear in their eyes and bellies that ran like dogs 
I barrelled down laughing screaming Susie 
you forgot your clogs 
well, Old Mr. Heffer 
I'm really pleased to meet you 
I didn't mean to scare your blue-eyed child 
but Billy wouldn't talk to me 
and Susie wouldn't look at me 
it made me so doggone crazy 
I had to chase them for a mile 
all wanted was change for a buck 
Well I'm back and I'm feelin' good tonight 
yea I'm back and I'm feelin' right 
so get back 'cause I'm feelin' right 
Jesus!
