Tell me where did you go ?
Tell me where did you go ?
Tell me where did you go ?
Hoping and praying maybe I'm mistaken
That this feeling is all in my imagination
Cos'I, I never knew your love would change so fast
I thought we'd built a love so strong to last
Driving me crazy am I losing you
Won't you tell me 'cos I need to know
Tell me where did you go ?
We made a promise to be open now the secrecy
where did you go ?
you drive me crazy, 'can't imagine how it's hurting me
where did you go ?
Although your here with me it seems we've lost that chemistry
And I can't be in love on my own
where did you go ?
Tell me where did you go ?
You said forever we'd cherish all our dream together
'Seems like forever, forever since I felt the pleasure
Oh girl, the pleasure holding you so close at night
The times we used to talk by candle light
There's something in the air you've been so cold
Is there something that I need to know
Tell me where did you go ?
We made a promise to be open now the secrecy
where did you go ?
you drive me crazy, 'can't imagine how it's hurting me
where did you go ?
Although your here with me it seems we've lost that chemistry
And I can't be in love on my own
where did you go ?
Cos'I, I never knew your love would change so fast
I thought we'd built a love so strong to last
Driving me crazy am I losing you
Won't you tell me 'cos I need to know
Tell me where did you go ?
We made a promise to be open now the secrecy
where did you go ?
you drive me crazy, 'can't imagine how it's hurting me
where did you go ?
Although your here with me it seems we've lost that chemistry
And I can't be in love on my own
where did you go ?
