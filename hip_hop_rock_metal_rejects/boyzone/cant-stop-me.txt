I just can't imagine how it would be
To look in your eyes and feel misery
I can't believe what I would say
If I moved for your hand and you moved it away
Oh, and I may have done wrong
Won't you give me some time
It won't take me long
It's a yes-and-no game
All pain and no gain
You're here in my life
It's what I'm here for
Can't stop me from loving you
And nothing can take the place of you
All my advice I give it to thee
So take my heart and treat it honestly
If you don't take what I have for you
You'll never know what you're gonna lose
Oh, and I may have done wrong
Won't you give me some time
It won't take me long
It's a yes-and-no game
All pain and no gain
You're here in my life
It's what I'm here for
Can't stop me from loving you
And nothing can take the place of you
I swear I'll find you, girl now
I swear it
Yeah, I feel I've gotta stop, I swear
I swear I'll find you
And I may have done
Won't you give me some time
And I may have done wrong
It won't take me long
And I may have done wrong
Won't you give me some time
And I may have done wrong
It won't take me long
Can't stop me from loving you
And nothing can take the place of you
Can't you see, can't you see
It's you and me 'til the end of time
Stop, stop
