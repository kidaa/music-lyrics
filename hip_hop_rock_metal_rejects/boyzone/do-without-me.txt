Once, twice, three times, yeah
Once I can understand it
Twice I can let it be
Three times is one too many now
You'll have to do without me [X 2]

There was something in the way you
Tried to tell me that you only been
Out with your girlfriends doing what you do
No way I'm buying that too
'Cause I can tell when you're lying
And I'm so tired of trying
To justify what you do when all you do is keep
Hurting me

And it cuts just like a knife to think about it
That you cheated on me with somebody else

[CHORUS X 2]

Once, twice, three times one too many

There will be no more lonely
Nights waiting by the telephone
Hoping that you'll find the time
To call me up tell you no more
So let me make you a promise
The love we had you're gonna miss
'Cause I know that this time will be
The last time, we're history

And it drags me down to even think about
Leaving you's the only way to deal with this

[CHORUS]

Once, twice, three times one too many Once, twice, three times one too many

[CHORUS X 4]

Once, twice, three times one too many
Once, twice, three times one too many
Once, twice, three times one too many
Once, twice, three times one too many
