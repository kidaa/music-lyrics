I kept it inside for the longest time 
And I can't keep keeping it
All this love that's inside of my heart
Maybe it's safer not to say that I care
Maybe this road won't lead me anywhere
But if I don't tell you now
I may never get the chance again
To tell you that I need you, tell you what I'm feeling
If I keep these feelings in
And if I don't say the words
How will you hear what's inside my heart
How will you know then
If I don't tell you now

I'd do anything to be in your dreams
And I can't stand standing by
With this dream that's inside my heart
Maybe I'm only gonna make a mistake
And there's a chance maybe my heart will break

[CHORUS]

How will you know you're inside my soul
Oh it's driving me crazy
Cause you don't see, you're the world to me
I'm so afraid to see
The way that I feel for you

[CHORUS]

Ohhhh ohhhh
If I don't tell you now
