I thought that I 
Was like an island
Guess I was wrong 
Guess I was wrong 
I see your face 
And then it hits me 
That I will miss you 
Oh when you're gone 

My heart will sleep 
Until you wake it 
I hope and pray 
It won't be long 

This house is home 
And when you leave it 
Then I will miss you 
Oh when you're gone 

I've been taking it all for granted 
It was there in front of my face 
I couldn't see into understanding 
And how could I know 
How could I loose my way 

I've been taking it all for granted 
I got no excuses for that 
I couldn't see into understanding
But how could I know 
I wonder when you look back

Will you remember 
Our road is straight 
Our road is long 
My heart is with you 
And I will miss you 
Oh I will miss you 
I know I will miss you 
Oh when you're gone
