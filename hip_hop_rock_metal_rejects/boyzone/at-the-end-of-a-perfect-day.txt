It's all in a perfect way
Just a part of the perfect way 
And as long as the world goes around
I will pray as I lay me down 
At the end of a perfect day 
I wake to greet another morning 
And feel the cold beneath my feet 
I rise to hear my future calling 
It's calling to me 

I watch the people through my window 
Then turn the radio up loud 
And then I sit and watch the sun go
And I know as the rain's coming down 

[CHORUS]

Everybody needs some highs and lows 
I guess we're lucky to be here 
And I don't care which way the wind blows 
Cos I know through the laughter and the tears 

[CHORUS]

Just a part of the perfect way 
And as long as the world goes around
I will pray as I lay me down 
At the end of a perfect 
At the end of a perfect 
At the end of a perfect day
