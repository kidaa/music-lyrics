In this world of confusion
Under the same sun
Save us from complication
Let the message run
I was speaking so many tongues
In a voice loud and clear
We'll bridge communications
Let the message run
So do I talk to another?
Can we speak as one?
And if we talk to each other
We shall all be
We shall all be
We shall all be one
One
Let us run free
Oh let us see oh let us see
Eyes of a child
Let the message run free
Let us run free let us run free
Oh let us see oh let us see
Eyes of a child
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run
Through the wires like lightning
Over land and ocean
No more in isolation
We shall all be
We shall all be
We shall all be one
One
Let us run free let us run free
Oh let us see oh let us see
Eyes of a child
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run
Come, come on
Let me hear you say
Come on, come on
Let us run free
Let us run free
Let us run free
Oh let us see
oh let us see
Eyes of a child
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run
Through the wires like lightning
Over land and ocean
No more in isolation
Let the message run free
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run
Let us run free
let us run free
Oh let us see
oh let us see
Eyes of a child
Let the message run free
