I sit and watch the time go by
Can someone please tell me the reason why
How can a man stay dignified
When all he does is cry inside
I need to know
And question how I'm feeling
I have to know
Why girl, it's still been keeping us apart yeah yeah
If I ask myself
What you mean to me
If I could reach inside
I'd see that you're everything I've waited for
And I tell myself what you mean to me
I'm down on my knees for you
Praying you'll hear what I'm saying
Believe me its true yeah yeah
I'm waiting for you

Do you feel alone
On your own tonight
And would you like someone to hold you tight
We've gotta keep this love alive
Hand in hand and side by side

I need to know
Please tell me how your feeling
Guess you should know
Why girl its still been keeping us apart yeah yeah

If I ask myself what you mean to me
If I could reach inside
I'd see that you're everything I've waited for
And I tell myself what you mean to me
I'm down on my knees for you
Praying you'll hear what I'm saying believe me its true yeah yeah
I'm waiting for you

Right here for you
Waiting for you
I'm waiting for you
