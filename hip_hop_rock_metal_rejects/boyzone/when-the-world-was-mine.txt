It never rained, the sun was always shining
Every traffic light was always green
There was a time when every door was open
The universe was mine..or so it seemed
Ever roll was seven or eleven
That it would ever end never crossed my mind
I was flying higher than the heavens
Back when the world was mine

Sometimes a man can't see
When he has it all
Take a look at me
Oh how he mighty fall
Once I ruled the earth
Once upon a time
When I had your love
When the world was mine

Oh the changes I'd make if I had the power
How could I have so much and be so blind
But at least for a bright and shining moment
I had you, and the world was mine

[CHORUS]

Once I ruled the earth
Once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
