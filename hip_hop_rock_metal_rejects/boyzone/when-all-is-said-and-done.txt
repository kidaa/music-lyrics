Days that we spent
When I was so small
Never let me fall
You never let me fall
Taught me to see
The right and the wrong
Oh I'm not that strong
Wish I was that strong
You've been good to me
Tending my every need
Just look what I am
Can't you see--it's you in me
When all is said and done
Look before you--I'm your son
Can't you see
It's you in me
A man...

Now I'm a man
Time has gone so fast
I didn't want it to
I didn't want it to
Wen't on my way
Like a crazy young fool
I never wanted to
I never wanted to
You've been good to me
Tending my every need
Just look what I am
Can't you see--it's you in me

[CHORUS]
