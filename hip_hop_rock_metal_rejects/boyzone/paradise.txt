It's not often that you find someone
      Who can fulfill all your dreams inside
      Like an angel from above
      She was the one for me, believe

      But it doesn't wither like a flower in snow
      I always wanted you to know

      We're going to build a bridge
      Between our hearts
      Going to cross the river of love
      Into paradise, paradise
      Going to walk up the road, hand in hand
      To the castle in the sky
      Where we're going to live
      Going to live, yeah

      And when she opens up her eyes
      It's like a perfect sunrise outside
      I put my fingers through he hair
      And it feels like silk to me

      But it doesn't wither like a flower in snow
      I always wanted you to know

      CHORUS

      Yeah yeah yeah yeah

      Don't you know
      We're going to build a bridge
      Between our hearts
      Going to cross the river of love
      Into paradise, paradise

      CHORUS to fade
