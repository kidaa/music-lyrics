Let you leave that day
Let you walk on by
Breaking up would pay
But you had far more pride
If I could give would god accept me
Tried so hard to live oh why
Did you have to go out of my life
Never got the chance to say goodbye
You flew away
You flew away, you left, you flew away
This heart it aches
Oh babe you flew away
And I cry
I pray each night to god
Sat along the bay
Watched the stars in the sky
Seems like yesterday that you were by my side
If I could give
Would you still want me
And would you forgive oh why
Did you have to go out of my life
Never got the chance to say goodbye
You flew away, you flew away, you left, you flew away
This heart it aches
Oh babe you flew away and I cry
I pray each night to god.
