I thought of every reason
excuses I could give
But all it took was one to break your heart
I thought it would be easy
and soon you would forgive
but now I gotta beg you girl
can't stand to be apart
Chorus
and I must've been high
girl to let you by
no good reason why there's no you and I
and I must'be been low
girl to let you go
how was I to know
I would miss you so
girl I miss you so
I wanted to move on girl
no time to settle down
didn't wanna give my love to only you
but since you have been gone girl
I took a look around
and if I gotta beg you girl
that's what I'm gonna do
Chorus
oh girl, I'll give you everything I gotta give
oh girl, and I will make it all up I swear to you
oh girl, all I'm askin' you girl is to forgive me girl
that's what you gotta do
and I must've been...
Chorus
