How many times
      Have I told you tonight
      There's no need to worry
      It'll all be alright
      So don't walk away
      At the end of the day
      I'll make you sorry
      If you decide to stay
      Sometimes it's hard to hold on
      That's when your heart needs to be strong

      That's how love goes
      that's how love goes
      Don't ask me why
      Only love knows
      What you're feeling inside
      That's how love goes
      that's how love goes
      One day it's goodbye
      Then it's just one more try
      Nobody knows how love goes
      how love goes, how love goes, how love goes

      More than I see
      more than I see
      More I believe
      That nothing is certain
      When you're following your dream
      So all I can do
      all I can do
      Is keep holding you
      holding you
      Maybe together
      We can make them dreams come true
      Sometimes it's hard to hold on
      That's when your heart needs to be strong

      CHORUS

      Sometimes it's easy
      To think you understand
      Just then you see it
      Slipping through your hands

      CHORUS to fade
