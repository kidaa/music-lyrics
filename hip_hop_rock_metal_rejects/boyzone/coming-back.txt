Keep coming back
Coming back

Keep coming back

When you do that thing you do
You fill me with desire
Maybe it's because of you
I can't get no higher
You may not be right for me
But I don't give a damn 'cause
What I feel is exctasy
That's all I need

I don't care about what people say
I keep coming back
Coming back
Coming back for more
I'm still up for one more round
Let's play
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I get so high, high
And though you lie, lie
I just don't mind, mind
Coming back for more
My friends they say, say
You gotta get away, away
You know the next day
I'll be back for more

I keep coming back
Coming back
Coming back for more
I keep coming back
Coming back
Coming back for more

Baby you're enough for me
I don't need no other
And all the time I'm not with you
Babe, I miss the fire
Some may think it's scandalous
Some may say it's crazy
They can't see what's going on
Between you and me

I have never felt like this before
I keep coming back, coming back
Coming back for more
Tell me what am I to do
I need more and more
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I get so high, high
And though you lie, lie
I just don't mind, mind
Coming back for more
My friends they say, say
You gotta get away, away
You know the next day
I'll be back for more
I get so high, high
And though you lie, lie
I just don't mind, mind
Coming back for more
My friends they say, say
You gotta get away, away
You know the next day
I'll be back for more

I keep coming back, coming back
