You took the lot and there's only dirt
You took the bet and you lost my shirt
You walked my dog and you let it run away
You took yourself on a holiday
You said you needed to get away
Then I got a postcard from the room...
Here I must have known you
For so many years but
You always seemed to slip away...

Where have you been
I'm been upon the sea
Where have you been
Out on the Twilight Zone
Where have you been
I've been to the other side
and it's good to be back home..
Yeah yeah yeah

Two potatoes you won't get far
You got some air and blew yourself away..
Here I must have known you
For so many years but
You always seemed to slip away...

Where have you been
Laying upon the sea
Where have you been
Out on the Twilight Zone
Where have you been
I've been to the other side
and it's good to be back home..
Yeah yeah yeah

Where have you been
I've been on a rocket ride
Where have you been
I've been for a million miles
Where have you been
I've been to the other side
and it's good to be back home..
I said it's good to be back home..
