Shoo-do-do oh yeah
Oh stay
Stay
Stay
I wanna show you
Every single dream I got inside of my mind
I wanna love you
Better than you've ever known before

You are my fantasy
You're everything to me
Can't watch you walkin' out my door

So why don't you
Stay - for a minute
Give me one more try
Stay with me I'm falling apart
Baby won't you
Stay - for a minute
Please don't say goodbye
You and me together
Stay in my life

A new beginning
And let nothing come between us ever again
And somehow, I will be singin'
Songs you've never heard before

You are my fantasy
You're everything to me
Can't watch you walkin' out my door

[CHORUS]

Give me a second chance
To build a new romance
That's all I'm askin' for tonight, baby
Cmon' and take my hand
And try to understand
You gotta stay in my life..ooh..

Oh yeah
Ooooooh
Stay - for a minute
Give me one more try

Stay
Stay with me baby I'm falling apart
Please don't say goodbye
Stay with me tonight
Don't say goodbye
Stay in my life

[CHORUS]

Give me one more try, baby
You and me together
Stay in my life
Why don't you
Stay - for a minute
Give me one more try
Stay with me I'm falling apart
