I gotta tell you
Girl you're in danger
No-one can save you now
You're gonna be mine somehow
You didn't know me
To me you're no stranger
Saw you each day every week
I was too shy to speak
I loved you long ago
I loved you even though
You never looked my way
But now I've got to say
Oh Carol, gotta make you mine
Carol, it'll work out fine
I know it's love
I know it's love for real
I know it's love
I know the way I feel
Carol, you're my dream come true
Carol, when I look at you
Carol, say you'll never go
Carol, now I need you so
Carol when I hold you tight
I don't want to say goodnight
Can't you feel it
It's all around you
Reach out and take it all
Don't be afraid to fall
Don't want to lose you
Now that I've found you
I'll always be around
I'll never let you down
I loved you long ago
I loved you even though
You never looked my way
But now I've got to say
Oh Carol, gotta make you mine
Carol, it'll work out fine
I know it's love
I know it's love for real
I know it's love
I know the way I feel
Carol, you're my dream come true
Carol, when I look at you
Carol, say you'll never go
Carol, now I need you so
Carol when I hold you tight
I don't want to say goodnight
Oh Carol, gotta make you mine
Carol, it'll work out fine
I know it's love
I know it's love for real
I know it's love
I know the way I feel
Carol, you're my dream come true
Carol, when I look at you
Carol, say you'll never go
Carol, now I need you so
Oh Carol
