If only you were here
Today
Forever
And if only you were mine
I would say
It's forever
I've read through the lines
Oh yeah
I've read through the lines
So is that how the story goes
Is the book now closed
Said you'd always be around
Oh yeah

And I can't deny, yeah
I can't deny
The way you left me on my own
I thought our love had grown
And we'd never be apart

If only you were here
Today
Forever
And if only you were mine
I would say
It's forever
Cos I cannot help myself
Oh no no
From falling in love

I used to know why
I used to know why our love was
Endless time gone by
Like angels in the sky
Never thought I'd be so wrong
Oh yeah

And I can't decide
Yeah
And I can't decide whether
Our love was in despair
Instead of playing fair
And I'll miss you since you've gone

[CHORUS X 2 to fade]
