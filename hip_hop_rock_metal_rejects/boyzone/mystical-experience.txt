Looking for you, lost in my emptiness,
When the cold makes me weary, cold and lonely,
Looking for ecstasy to make me live again,
A supernatural feeling when you hold me,
Everytime you're here beside me,
There is thunder, there is lightning,
I feel the earth move and it's a different story,
All the power, the heaven and the glory...
CHORUS:
It's almost like a mystical experience,
To feel I'm born again when you come near me,
To reach the stars above me,
The minute that you love me,
Oh, it's like a mystical experience,
Almost like a mystical experience,
To rise with every step as you come near me,
And when I'm closer to ya your kisses, halleluya,
Take me to a mystical experience.
Won't you please hurry back,
Now that I need you so,
To drive away all the sorrow and to guide me,
Bring the sound of your hapiness to my loneliness,
To exorcise all the demons that live inside of me,
Life without you's like a stranger
Full of shadows, full of danger,
And when you're with me the world is full of passion,
And when you touch me, a magical reaction...
CHORUS TO FADE
