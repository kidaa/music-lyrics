Oh yeah
My baby baby baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh
It's Monday morning
And I can't get outta bed
Though I know, that I gotta go
Rather dream of you instead
Replay your message
So I can hear your voice
Can't wait or hesitate
You're leavin' me no choice
Keep it on the down low
I try to play it cool
Keeps getting' stronger
And I know ya feel it too
Don't you know it baby, I'm crazy for you

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Only thinkin' of you
Friday, Saturday, Sunday now you're all I wanna do
Winter, summer, spring or fall
I feel ya all the year through,
I'll take a plane, I'll take a car
I just wanna be, oughta be, gotta be where you are

Oh yeah
Where you are

It's Friday evening
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I finally made it through
Runnin' every red light
Just to get to you
We'll take our time, babe
'Til we see the morning light
Mad fun in the summer sun
And we're gonna do it right
I'm all about you, babe
And I know you're all about me
Twenty-four seven
I need you constantly
Don't you know baby that's the way it should be

[CHORUS]

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah

Ain't no lover like the one I got
We keep it real, we keep it hot
This kinda love could never be bought
Ain't no reason we should ever part
You got my back, you got my heart
You're the sun, the moon and the stars

Oh yeah
Hey yeah
Oh baby baby baby

[CHORUS]

Ain't no lover like the one I got
We keep it real, we keep it hot
Ain't no reason we should ever part
You got my back, you got my heart
You got my heart

Ain't no lover like the one I got
We keep it real, we keep it hot
We keep it real, we keep it hot
Ain't no reason we should ever part
You got my back, you got my heart
oh no

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Only thinkin' of you
Friday, Saturday, Sunday now you're all I wanna do
You're all I wanna do
