I was afraid
      Of ever letting you in now
      And showing you my heart
      Was something that won't begin
      I was on a road
      Blown by the wind
      Life was just a stormy sea
      Just waiting to rescind

      But you lift me up
      And you give me hope
      And with every breath in my body
      I want the world to know why

      She is the one that I am certain of yeah
      She is the one that I am sure of oh yeah
      She is the one 
      She is the one
      And I thank the Lord for what she's done

      I was amazed
      Too good to be true
      You know I never planned this
      Coming out of the blue
      So off that road 
      I've made my mistakes
      I open up to you now
      Hope your heart will not break

      But you lift me up
      And you give me hope
      And with every breath in my body
      I want the world to know why

      She is the one, that I am certain of yeah
      She is the one, that I am sure of oh yeah
      She is the one 
      She is the one
      And I thank the Lord

      She is the one that I am certain of yeah
      She is the one and I thank the Lord
      For what she's done
      Thank the Lord
      For what she's done
      And I thank the Lord for what she has done
