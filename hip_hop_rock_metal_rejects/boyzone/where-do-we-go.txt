I ask, when will I see you again
Once was all that we had
And your touch I've forgotten
How good it was
Question my train of thoughts
Turning around in my mind
Can't let go
Visions of you baby
Is all that I know

Where do we go from here
How do we find our way to go on
Promise you'll stay by my side
Don't walk away from me now
Where do we go

Oh where do we go
Oh yeah yeah

I ask myself where are you now
Are you alone in the night
Do you feel the same way
That I'm feeling for you 
'Cause babe I need to know

Constantly sleepless
Alone in my bed
Visions of you babe
Is all that I have

[CHORUS]

Oh where do we go
Oh yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Constantly sleepless
Alone in my bed
Visions of you babe
Is all that I have

[CHORUS]

Where do we go from here
Where do we go yeah yeah
Oh oh oh yeah
How do we find our way to go on
Where do we go
Promise you'll stay by my side
Don't walk away don't walk away, baby
Don't walk away from me now
All I ask now
Don't walk away don't walk away, baby
All I ask now
Promise you'll stay by my side
Don't walk away from me now
Where do we go
