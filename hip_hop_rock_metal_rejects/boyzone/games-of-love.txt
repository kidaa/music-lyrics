Many years ago now
      in the Garden of Love
      A temptation that was watched from above
      I'll be your Adam, if you'll be my Eve
      So come show me that you
      will not deceive

      That love, just a crazy feeling
      Deep and hidden meaning, it's true
      And love, takes some understanding
      So don't you go and break all the rules

      We're talking A-B-C
      I'm singing do-re-mi
      I'll teach you endlessly
      Games of Love

      We're counting 1-2-3
      I'm writing  U 4 Me 
      I'll teach you endlessly
      Games of Love

      Listen to me now girl
      'Cos you've known all along
      It's a game of love so don't play it long
      I'll be your Romeo and you Juliet
      Just read the book and you won't forget

      That love, just a crazy feeling
      Deep and hidden meaning, it's true
      And love, takes some understanding
      So don't you go and break all the rules

      repeat CHORUS
