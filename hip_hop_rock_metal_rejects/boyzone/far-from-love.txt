It's been a while it seems so long
I still remember when we were young
Living our lives as one - always
You had to stay I had to go
Leaving was hard but I hope you know
You've been a part of me - always

Even though it's been so long
My heart is telling me keep strong
Cause I know I'll find you

I am far from my love
Round the world
But I never will forget
So I wish on a star
To be right back in your arms
And I pray high above
To be right back where you are

I'm back and I believe
Everything's different now you'll see
We'll be together now - always

Even though it's been so long
My heart is telling me keep strong
Cause I know I'll find you

[CHORUS]

Sorry I have to leave again
Never intended it to end
Until we meet again - always

I am far from my love
Round the world
But I never will forget
So I wish on a star
To be right back in your arms
And I pray high above
But I never will forget
So I wish on a star
To be right back in your arms
And I pray high above
To be right back where you are
