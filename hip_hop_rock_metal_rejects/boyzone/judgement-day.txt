Someday I know I'll find my way to say
What makes the world a better place, you say
My mind is telling me to fight for my rights
I've learned my lesson done my time
Someone please just...

Save me
Help me please don't break me, I pray
I pray, I pray
It's crazy
My heart's pounding, save me
On judgement day, my day

Doomsday I know that I have made mistakes
I've paid please don't give my soul away
I'm dreaming of freedom I watch from my window inside
My pulse and my breathing is what I am needing for life

You've watched me sleepless seen me cry, oh why
Help me my life is on the line
Someone please just

Save me
Help me please don't break me I pray, I pray
It's crazy
My heart's pounding, save me
On judgement day, my day

My day
My day
My day

My mind is telling me to fight for my rights
I've learned my lesson done my time
Someone please just...

Save me
Help me please don't break me I pray, I pray
It's crazy
My heart's pounding save me
On judgement day, my day

Save me
Help me please don't break me
My day
My day
It's crazy
My heart's pounding save me
On judgement day, my day
