Cause Heaven knows
Yeah
Tears run dry on a young man's face
Feel the glow of warm embrace
Been on a boat to the edge of somewhere
Searched for you almost everywhere
One more hill but you know I'll be there
No more pain left for me to bear
Cause now I'm almost there
Baby it's growing much stronger
From the day that you said
You were gonna be mine
From the way I was lead into your mind
Maybe love was making me stronger
From the day that you said you were gonna be mine
From the way I was lead into your mind
Everything comes to those who wait
Like a Winter for Spring
And the beauty it brings
And everyone searches for the perfect one
As Heaven knows
As Heaven knows
If you believe, like you know that I do
You will see I'm the one for you
Never forget when I take your hand
At last, I'm here, can't you understand
So bring on the night and I'll make it right
Take a dull day and I'll make it bright
Cause now we're almost there
But baby it's growing much stronger
From the day that you said
You were gonna be mine
From the way I was lead into your mind
Maybe love's making me stronger
From the day that you said you were gonna be mine
From the way I was lead into your mind
Everything comes to those who wait
Like a Winter for Spring
And the beauty it brings
And everyone searches for the perfect one
As Heaven knows
As Heaven knows
Everything comes to those who wait
Like a Winter for Spring
And the beauty it brings
And everyone searches for the perfect one
As Heaven knows
As Heaven knows
As Heaven knows
As Heaven knows
As Heaven knows
