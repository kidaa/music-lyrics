Seems like I was always running
From someone or something
So scared what life could hold
Didn't even want to know
Each day I would stand against it
Put up my defences
Wouldn't let nobody inside
Then you walking in my life
Your love is all I know
Never let you go
Baby with you I choose my road
All my life
You're the reason why
Baby with you I walk that road

Now nothing can defeat me
Knowing you complete me
You make me stronger every day
You lead me all the way
Anything you wanna do
I'll be there beside you
As long as you don't leave
My dreams are guaranteed

[CHORUS]

Never let you go
Baby with you I choose my road
All my life
You're the reason why
Baby with you I walk that road
