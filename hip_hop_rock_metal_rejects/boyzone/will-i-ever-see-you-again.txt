We were on the right track baby
Definitely maybe
Running with a dream in our heart
We could make a lifetime loving
Something out of nothing
Missing holding you in my arms
I could make a living
Taking you and giving you everything
We can be a legend
Take me up to heaven and tell me
Tell me

Will I ever see you again
Will I ever hold you again
Only want to be with you again
Only ever wanted to be together
Will I ever see you again
Will I ever hold you again
Only want to be with you again
You're all I ever wanted
Will I ever see you again

I could make a living

Girl, you really got me wishing
I could feel your kissing
Keeping me awake every night
I would change a thousand seasons
Just to find a reason
To be there when you turn out the lights

I could make a living
Taking you and giving you everything
We can be a legend
Take me up to heaven and tell me
Tell me

Will I ever see you again
Will I ever hold you again
Only want to be with you again
Only ever wanted to be together
Will I ever see you again
Will I ever hold you again
Only want to be with you again
You're all I ever wanted
Will I ever see you again

All I can do now is just pray
That someday soon I'll hold your face
Such a beautiful face face

Come on

Will I ever see you again
Come on
Will I ever hold you again
Only want to be with you again
Only ever wanted to be together
Will I ever see you again
Come on
Will I ever hold you again
Only want to be with you again
You're all I ever wanted
Will I ever see you again
