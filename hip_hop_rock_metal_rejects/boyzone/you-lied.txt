I can't figure out just what went wrong
I remember a love so strong
Good bad times, were carelessly so free
But it happened to me
I heard from my friends you were cheating on me
I sat up waiting it was quarter past three
You said you stopped, that you quit playing around
But I finally found out

You lied
Oh, you took my soul
You took it away from me
You lied
Oh, I've lost control
I've lost the way we used to be

Why did it happen, why was it me
You broke our promise, our destiny destiny
I gave you my love, my soul, my heart
But you tore it apart

You can't deny it it's so easy to see
So tell me who was on your Caller ID
I can't forgive you, you know you've done wrong
And I've finally found out

You lied
Oh, you took my soul
You took it away from me
You lied
Oh, I've lost control
I've lost the way we used to be
I've cried
Oh, needed you so
But you turned away from me
I've cried
Oh, I'm on down low
Why did you tell those lies to me

I have to face what's happened
It wasn't meant to be like this
Now I see it's over
My questions must be answered
Won't you please just tell me why

You lied
Oh, you took my soul
You took it away from me
Oh away from me
You lied
Oh, I've lost control
You lied to me honey
Hey baby
I've lost the way we used to be
I've cried 
Oh, needed you so
But you turned away from me
I've cried 
Oh, I'm on down low
Yeah
Why did you tell those lies to me
You lied to me baby
You lied
