Live your life to the fall
With a lifetime of smiles
Made us know right from wrong
Always knowing a lie
You made us to be tough
But never too rough
Rise above what you said
Never easily lead.

And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song
I wrote it for you
It won't take all day
just a minute or two

You were a friend
Walk with you to the end
And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song

So I'll try and go on
Loving all that we know
Through the hardest of times
you put on a show

You made us stand tall
When all around us would fall
Even when you were alone
You believed you could fly

And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song
I wrote it for you
It won't take all day
Just a minute or two

You were a friend
Walk with you to the end
And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song

And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song
We wrote it for you
It'll take all our lives
Just to help us get through
You were a friend
Walk with you to the end
And one day we'll all sing along
'Cause this is your song.
