I keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah I'm working my way back to you babe
And a happiness that died
I let it get away
Keep paying every day
When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
And how I cried over losing you
See I'm down and out
And I ain't about to go
Living my life without you
Hey every day, I made you cry
I'm begging girl, 'til the day I die
I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah I'm working my way back to you, babe
And a happiness that died
I let it get away
Keep paying every day
I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
If I had been a man in reality
Then you'd be here baby loving me
Now my nights are long
And only a lion could prowl
Girl, I guess we're too slow
Girl, but you're too proud
And you won't give in
But when I think about all I can't win
I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah I'm working my way back to you, babe
And a happiness that died
I let it get away
Keep paying every day
My heart is kind of low
I just gotta get back home
I'm really sorry
For acting that way
I'm really sorry
Ooh, little girl
I'm really sorry
For throwing away our love
Sweet little girl
I'm really sorry
For making you cry
I really need you
Don't you hear me talking to you
Really sorry
For telling you lies
For so long
Oh please
I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah I'm working my way back to you, babe
And a happiness that died
I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah I'm working my way back to you, babe
And a happiness that died
Working, working
I'm really working
Working baby
Can't you see me working
