As I stood and said goodbye
With a lump in my throat
Couldn't bear the hurt inside
As I found your foolish note
While I understand your pain
I could see what you've to gain
By leaving me alone
Why won't you come back home

But your love whispers through my life
And I can't fake the pain inside

If you'd only let me get close to you
Oh girl, I'd feel the world's at my feet
And I'd know that all my dreams have come true
For me and for you
Just wait and believe, you'll see
I want to get close to you

Close to you
So close to you
Close to you

Well the road was long
And my tears have all dried up
Because the distance we shared
Was an enemy of love

I got my bag on my back
And my coat in my hand
I'm gonna take this distance
Unto another man's land

But your love whispers through my life
And I can't fake the pain inside

If you'd only let me get close to you
Oh girl, I'd feel the world's at my feet
And I'd know that all my dreams have come true
For me and for you
Just wait and believe, you'll see
I want to get close to you

Close to you
So close to you
Close to you

I want to get close to you

Close to you
So close to you
Close to you

So close to you
Close to you
So close to you
Close to you
