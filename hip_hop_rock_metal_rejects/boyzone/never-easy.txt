Say goodbye...woah
It's another fight
On another night
to a stranger's home
that's far from home

It's cold in here
But I'm not clear
Where I have to go
But I know...

I'll ignore what I feel what I feel
Cos I ain't making a deal no no
Time is rolling by
Wondering how far
How far, how far..to fly..

Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
These things shall be..woah
Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
That's the way it is..woah

In a different light
Do you know what's right
Am I pretending, no
Well I guess so
Don't you feel
Cos baby, I am here
I won't let you go
But I know..

I'll ignore what I feel what I feel
Cos I ain't making a deal no no
Time is rolling by
Wondering how far
How far, how far..to fly..

Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
These things shall be..woah
Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
That's the way it is..woah

I'll ignore what I feel
I ain't making a deal
Time is rolling by
Wondering how far to fly..

Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
That's the way it is..woah
Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
Theses things shall be..woah
Never easy to say goodbye
No reason why
That's the way it is..woah..
