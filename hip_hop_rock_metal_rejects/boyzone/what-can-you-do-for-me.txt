What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
What can you do for me
Let me hear you say
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
What can you do for me

Well my Mother always told me
Shouldn't wait for things above me
What goes up comes down
Now now girl
If the rings should fall from Saturn
You'll find me skiing through Manhattan
What goes up comes down

Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you
What can you do for me
Let me hear you say

Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you
What can you do for me
What can you do for me

When we go on our vacation
Gonna blow your imagination
What goes up comes down
Now now girl
Don't you feel intrepidation
Regarding my reputation
What goes up comes down

Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you
What can you do for me
Let me hear you say now

Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you
What can you do for me

Tell me, tell me

Yeah
Yeah

[CHORUS X 3]

Hey you
What can you do for
What can your lovin' ever do for
Hey you
What can you do for me.
