Take a pinch of one man
      Wrap him up in suntan
      Add a touch of blue blood
      And a little bitty bit of
      whatever you choose

      Curly black and kinky
      Mix it with love and let's see
      If you lump it altogether
      Well you've got a recipe
      for a get along scene...
      Oh what a beautiful dream
      If it could only come true
      You know you know...

      What we need is a great big melting pot
      Big enough to take the world
      and all it's got
      Keep it stiring for a hundred years or more
      Turn out coffee colored people
      by the score
      Yeah...no

      Mick and Lady Faithful
      And everyone who's graceful
      You know the living could be tasteful
      And we should all get together
      in a mixing machine
      Yeah yeah yeah

      The poorest and the wealthy
      Weakest and the healthy
      If you lump it all together
      Well you gotta recipe
      for a get along scene
      I'd better call up the Queen
      It's only fair that she know
      you know you know...

      CHORUS to fade
