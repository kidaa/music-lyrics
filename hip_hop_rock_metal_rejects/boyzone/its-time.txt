Here at home, the thoughts are
Racing through my crazy mind
And trying to figure out
If I'm loving you this one more time
And when I got the mail
It made me close the door
Just right behind
On a trail of clothes
Left lying here
Thrown across the floor now
Maybe it's the way this love was meant to be
And maybe it's the only way for you and me
It's time, to say goodbye
It's time, yeah, oh please don't cry girl
It's time, two reasons why
It's time, I will never lie to you
You cast your spell
But the magic has been broken down
And I'm all packed up
With empty boxes lying all around
It's like a flickering flame
That casts a shadow on the brightest day
And does it help to know
That I feel the same
And it's gone now
Maybe it's the way this love was meant to be
And maybe it's the only way for you and me
It's time, to say goodbye
It's time, yeah, oh please don't cry girl
It's time, two reasons why
It's time, I will never lie
It's time, to say goodbye
It's time, yeah, oh please don't cry girl
It's time, two reasons why
It's time, I will never lie to you
