Is it a kind of a dream 
Floating out on the tide 
Following the river of death downstream 
Oh is it a dream 
There's a fog along the horizon 
A strange glow in the sky 
And nobody seems to know where it goes 
And what does it mean 
Oh is it a dream
Bright eyes, burning like fire 
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail 
How can the light that burned so brightly, 
Suddenly burn so pale 
Bright eyes

Is it a kind of a shadow 
Reaching into the night 
Wandering over the hills unseen 
Oh is it a dream 
There's a high wind in the trees 
A cold sound in the air 
And nobody ever knows where you go 
And where do you start 
Oh into the dark

[Chorus X 2]
