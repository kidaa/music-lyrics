In this world of confusion
Under the same sun
Save us from complication
Let the message run
I was speaking so many tongues
In a voice loud and clear
We'll bridge communications
Let the message run
So do I have to talk to another
Can we speak as one
And if we talk to each other
We should all be
We should all be
We should all be one
One

Let us run free
Oh let us see oh let us see
and through the eyes of a child
Let the message run free free

Let us run free let us run free
Oh let us see oh let us see
Through the eyes of a child
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run

Through the wires like lightening
Over land and ocean, yeah
No more in isolation
We should all be
We should all be
We should all be one
One

Let us run free let us run free
Oh let us see oh let us see
Through the eyes of a child
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run

Let's run free...
Let us run free
Oh, let us run free
Oh let us see
oh let us see
Through the eyes of a child
Let the message run free
let the message run, let the message run free

Through the wires like lightening
Over land and ocean
No more in isolation
Let the message run free
Let the message run free

Let us run free
let us run free
Oh let us see
oh let us see
Through the eyes of a child
Let the message run free
