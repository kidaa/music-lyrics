Hey baby you really got my tail in a spin
Hey baby I dont even know where to begin
But baby I got one thing I want you to know
Wherever you go tell me cause I'm gonna go
I found love, so don't hide it 
Life Is A Rollercoaster, just gotta ride it
I need you, so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery
Girl, lets get beside it 

Hey baby, you really got me flying tonight 
Hey Sugar, you almost got us punched in a fight 
thats alright 
And baby you know one thing I gotta know
Wherever you go, tell me cause I'm gonna show 

[CHORUS]

Can't you feel my heart 
Can't you feel my heart 
Can't you take my heart
[CHORUS]

So dont fight it, fight it, fight it.. [X 3]
