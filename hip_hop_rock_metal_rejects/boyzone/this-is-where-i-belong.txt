Here I stand in the northern rain
      And I can't believe I'm home again
      And I can't believe how nothing's changed
      I'm finding my way

      Old park bench where I carved my name
      But now it doesn't stand alone
      Cause now the trees have over grown
      Many a road that I've travelled
      That's led me a stray
      Here's where my heart's gonna stay

      This is where I belong
      This is where I come from
      No need to shed my tears
      Or face my fears anymore
      So I won't walk alone
      Taking things on my own
      All of the lands I've roamed
      Memories of my home
      They keep beating strong
      Cause this is where I belong

      There you stood in the open door
      Just like so many years before
      When I told you that I needed more
      In my life
      I was wrong to ever walk away
      Abandon all the love that we made
      But now I've learned from all my mistakes
      Just like a star in the sky
      Guiding me on
      Your love is pulling me home

      CHORUS

      Just like a star in the sky
      Guiding me on
      Your love is pulling me home

      CHORUS to fade
