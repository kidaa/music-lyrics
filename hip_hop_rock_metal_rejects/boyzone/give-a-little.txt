Give a little, take a little, pray a little
      Give a little, you know you've got to
      Take a little, just one more time
      Pray a little, to make it happen

      And I'd swear, I'd cross the road
      But you'd avoid me
      Please tell me, why?
      It ain't fair, I'd call you up
      But you won't answer
      Just no reply

      Too blind to see that ache inside
      So have a heart, I'm begging you

      Give a little, take a little, pray a little
      Say you want to
      Give a little, you know you've got to
      Take a little, just one more time
      Pray a little, to make it happen
      Say you want me, girl

      Somehow with every chance
      I'll make you happy
      You won't believe
      Sing out loud with each and every
      Waking moment
      You'll fill my head

      CHORUS

      Say you want me, girl
      And wait and see
      Too blind to see that ache inside
      So have a heart, I'm begging you

      Say you want me

      CHORUS to fade
