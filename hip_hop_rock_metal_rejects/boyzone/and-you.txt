For the way you hold your head
The way you lie across my bed
There is nothing to be said
About you
Girl you know my love for you
For my whole life it will be true
And everything that I should do
It is all for you
It is all for you

And you
You are the morning sky
And you
My love to justify
And you
Forever by my side

Just look into my eyes
And you will see the reason why

You stole the love from in my heart
When I met you back in the start
Now you know we just can't part
I love you

You have filled an empty space
For this man and his human race
There's nothing that could displace
I love you
I love you

And you
You are the morning sky
And you
My love to justify
And you
Forever by my side

Just look into my eyes
And you will see the reason why

For the way you hold your head
Lie across my bed
Lie across my bed
Lie across my bed
Lie across my bed
For the way you hold your head
Lie across my bed
Lie across my bed..[fade out]
