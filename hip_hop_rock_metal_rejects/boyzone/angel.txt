See her
Dreamin'
Don't wake me
'Cos it's real
Angel
Come fly
Through the sky
I see
A distant light
It's burning so bright
A mystical sight
A glorious flight
In the moonlight

So it's a secret I can tell you 'bout
What I saw, it was astounding now
Want this feeling forever in my life

Can you see her
Am I dreamin'
Please don't wake me
'Cos it's real
She's my angel

Angel
Can you see her
Am I dreamin'
Please don't wake me
'Cos it's real

She's my angel
She's my angel
Angel
She's my angel

I'm dreamin'
Of love
I'm jumping
Between the clouds
Come rain or come shine
I'm falling up to heaven
Race all through the night
Pray magic's in the air

So it's a secret I can tell you 'bout
What I saw, it was astounding now
Want this feeling forever in my life

Can you see her
Am I dreamin'
Please don't wake me
'Cos it's real
She's my angel

Can you see her
Am I dreamin'
Please don't wake me
'Cos it's real

She's my angel
She's my angel
She's my angel
She's my angel

She's my angel
Angel
She's my angel
Angel..[fade out]
