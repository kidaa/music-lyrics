Oooh
No one seems to think too much of me here
and they're glad to tell it to my face
And though I am not suppose to be here
I'm completely out of place
Somehow there has got to be a reason
even as I try to think it through
There's a bold from the blue

And I see a shooting star And I see a star
Set apart from all the rest
While the other stars are standing still ooh
He's on a quest
Every night this shooting star Every night this star
Dancing across the twilight sky
Cause he knows he doesn't quit fit in ooh
and he's longing to know why, why longing to know why

I feel so much better when it's night-time
That's when I can sort of disappear
When the sun is set and it's the right time
for pretending I'm not here
Sometimes I just start into the heavens
Wondering if the answer is inside
That's when I see the light 

Of my sent that shooting star
On his way to who know's where On his way to who know's where
He's a one like all the stars ooh
But he outshines out there shines out there
And the solitary star solitary star
Is an awful lot like me ooh
On an endless search through time and space
Far a place that won't seem wrong place that won't seem wrong

If we both hang on for long enough 
we both somehow are strong enough 
We'll find out were we belong

Every night this shooting star every night this star
dancing across the twilight sky 
Cause he knows he doesn't quit fit in ooh
and he's longing to know why why
Know why why
Why why
Why why
Know why why [to fade]
