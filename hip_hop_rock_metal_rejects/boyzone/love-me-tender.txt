Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfil
Oh my darling
I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me long
Take me into your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling
I love you
And I always will

For my darling 
I love you 
And I always will
