If I believe that I could do anything,
Could I spread my wings and say goodbye
So many people told me I couldn't win
But look at me now
Here I am in heaven's sky
And sometimes I say a prayer
Wishing that you could be here with me Cos I believe

I believe in love, it's the best of everything
I believe in hope and the changes it can bring
If you believe then nothing can stand in your way
Just say, I believe

If hope's the house I wanna be living in
Baby, I've got one foot in the door
Yes I do
All the years of waiting for your approval dear
Well I realised I don't need it anymore

'Cause I'm stronger everyday,
Now I'm strong enough to say, I believe

I believe in love, it's the best of everything
I believe in hope and the changes it can bring
If you believe then nothing can stand in your way
I believe

It's a fact of life that we're all in the game
But it's still your call
But we all play it
Sometimes we win, sometimes we fall
But that's no reason just to give it up, cause after all
If you can't choose what to be
You can choose what to dream
And I believe

I believe in love, it's the best of everything
I believe in hope and the changes it can bring
If you believe then nothing can stand in your way
Just say, oh I believe
