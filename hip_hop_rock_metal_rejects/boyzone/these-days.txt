[Brian:]
These days I've been feeling lucky
Looking all around me I see so many dreams that have come true
Like me right next to you, like the angels pulling through
These days have only just begun
[Ronan:]
Someone to come home to each and every night
All of my tomorrow's are finally looking bright, over
I won't rush it, why would I dare
Nothing could compare

[Both:]
To the way I've been feeling

These days
They are the best I've ever had
And they have only just begun
Here we are we're so connected
Like a moon is to the sun
I never thought I'd feel this way
Cause all I ever wanted, were these days

[Ronan:]
If I could, I'd try to freeze the moment
Set aside the future, stay right here, right now
Sometime, woah, fly like the flame that never dies
Like the love that's in your eyes
These days, have only just begun

[Brian:] 
Something to believe in when the world is going mad

[Ronan:] 
When the rain is crashing down girl it doesn't seem so bad doesn't seem so bad

[Brian:] 
I won't rush it 

[Ronan:]
No, why would I dare

[Both:]
Nothing could compare to the way I've been feeling

[CHORUS]

They are the best I've ever had
And they have only just begun
Here we are we're so connected
Like a moon is to the sun

[Brian:]
I never thought I'd feel this

[Ronan:]
I never thought I'd feel this way, baby

[Brian:]
In fact it happens when I pray

[Both:]
Cause all I ever really wanted
Were these days

All I ever really wanted
All I ever really wanted was these days
