You're gonna hold me up
You ain't gonna let me down
You're gonna hold me up
You ain't gonna let me down
Here to eternity
People said
The book of love
I've often read
True love, true love
People cry
The love I have
Won't be denied

You know this love I have
Can never be denied
Don't ever say to me
That I have never tried

All this love I have 
Will never be denied
Don't ever say to me
That I have never tried

You lift me up
Don't let me down
You lift me up
Be denied
Can never be denied

You lift me up
Don't let me down

Come and show me
Exactly what you feel
And if you can't explain
Exactly what they mean
'Cause I have known love
And it's often let me down
But I'll keep smiling
As long as you're around

All this love I have
Can never be denied
Don't ever say to me
That I have never tried

All this love I have
Will never be denied
Don't ever say to me
That I have never tried

You lift me up
Don't let me down
You lift me up
Be denied
Can never be denied

You lift me up
Don't let me down
You lift me up
Be denied
Can never be denied

You're gonna hold me up
You're gonna hold me up
You're gonna let me down
You ain't gonna let me down

Be denied
Can never be denied

You're gonna hold me up
You're gonna hold me up
You ain't gonna let me down
You ain't gonna let me down
Be denied
Can never be denied
Here to eternity
Here to eternity

And all this love I have
Can never be denied
Here to eternity
Here to eternity

And all this love I have
Can never be denied
Be denied
Be denied
