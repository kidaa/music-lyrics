And it's too late for us to argue now
And it's too late for you to cry
And it's too late for you to ask me now
Oh it's just too late tonight
And it's too late for you to find me now
And the sweet rose has bloomed and died
And my feelings for you have changed now
And it's just too late tonight
And I told you it would come to this
But when I talk to you, you always resist
But you never listen to me
And you only see what you wanna see

And it's too late for questions now
And so you sit and wonder why
And you're searching for all the answers now
But it's just too late tonight

It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
Oh yeah

It's too late tonight
Everything about me's changed
It's too late tonight
Now our lives are rearranged
It's too late tonight
Everytime we try to talk
It's too late tonight
All you ever do is walk
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
It's too late tonight
