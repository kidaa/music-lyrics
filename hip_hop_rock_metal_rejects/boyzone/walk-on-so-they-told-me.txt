Walk on, she's gone
better leave the girl alone
walk on, she's gone
don't even call her on the telephone
walk on move on now
you've got to be strong
so they told me
but when I see you and my heart drops
I still remember and it won't stop
that night I kissed you on the rooftop
we reached up and touched the sky
but then you told me goodbye
told me goodbye
don't try to tell me that a man don't cry
Walk on, she's gone
better leave the girl alone
walk on, she's gone
don't even call her on the telephone
walk on move on now
you've got to be strong
so they told me
my friends they tell me to forget you
pretend I never even met you
I try to smile but I bet you
loneliness and tears still show
one thing that nobody knows
nobody knows
you hold my heart and you won't let it go
Walk on, she's gone
better leave the girl alone
walk on, she's gone
don't even call her on the telephone
walk on move on now
you've got to be strong
so they told me
and if I get you back
you'll see, whoa
all the love in me
so take my hand and
your heart will grow stronger
heart will grow stronger
never, never, never let it go
chorus
