I saw a tear in your eye
How could I be so glad
To let you walk right out of my life
Just watch you break down and cry
But now it's time
Now it's time
To let you know
What's on my mind
That I
I never knew love like this
But no one will ever love you more
I promise you this
Oh...

No matter what comes my way
No matter what else may change
Nothing will change
The way I feel
My love for you
Is neverending
And no matter what
I'll never stop loving you

I know that I need to try
To realise what I was doing
To let you run and let you hide
I got this fear deep inside
Without you my life's not worth living
It's in my arms that you belong

And now...
I know I understand
What we have now complete
You're my everything I need
And you

[CHORUS]

It's only you yeah
Who turned my darkness into light
Who made my day ran smooth
Give me strength
Give me strength to carry on
Give me hope
Give me hope when all is gone

No matter what
I'm gonna give you love
'Cos baby I will never stop loving you
yeah it's you

No matter what comes my way
No matter what else may change
Nothing will change
The way I feel
My love for you
Is neverending
And no matter what
I'll never stop
No matter what comes my way
No matter what else may change..
