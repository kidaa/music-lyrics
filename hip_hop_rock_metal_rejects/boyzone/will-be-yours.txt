Nanananananana Nanananananana
All that you want, will be yours
Look here now, read my lips
Focus on my fingertips
Do you understand, these open hands
I give to you, all that's true
So sail away and free your ghost
Give away and you'll believe
All good things, you'll receive
 The more you give, the more you get
 Always try, not to forget
 So give it all away, hey....
 Nanananananana Nanananananana
 All that you want, will be yours
If I'm the one, you lookin'for
Then open up that boited door
Let me in, lead me through
You know; I'll do the same for you
Step by step, you'll be aware
Heart by heart, it truth is there
Now give away and you believe
All good things you'll receive

 The more you give, the more you get
 Always try, not to forget
 So give it all away, hey....
 All that you want
 The more you give, the more you get
 Always try, not to forget
 So give it all away, hey....
 All that you want, will be yours
 Nanananananana Nanananananana
