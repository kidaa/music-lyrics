Strong enough for two

      Love see us through
      Because of you
      I know we're strong enough
      Love see us through
      Through and through
      This love is strong enough for two

      I believe in all that love can bring
      Ha, I can see it's meant to be
      And we'll be together

      together
      You see the best in me
      forever
      We were meant to be
      'Cause I know it
      Yes, I know there's always you to come home to

      CHORUS

      Like a child I want this love to grow
      Oh, in my smile I tell it all
      So we'll be

      together
      You see the best in me
      forever
      We were meant to be
      'Cause I know it
      Yes, I know there's always you to come home to

      CHORUS

      Strong enough for two

      RAP
      Strong enough cos our lives are tough
      We've been together 'cause love's no bluff
      All you sexy ladies put your hands in the air
      Slam your body down, like you just don't care

      together
      You see the best in me
      forever
      We were meant to be
      'Cause I know it
      Yes, I know there's always you to come home to

      CHORUS X 3 to fade
