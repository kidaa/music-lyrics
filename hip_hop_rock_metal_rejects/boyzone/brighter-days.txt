I've done a lot of living in my life
Chased my share of rainbows in the sky
Before I stopped to ask the question why
I've fallen out of love too many times
But now I see
The possibilities
Oh how my life could be

From any other love I'd walk away
Love is temporary I would say
Now each night I find a reason to stay
With you there's always brighter days

I've broken a heart, a heart or two
I've let the curtain fall I guess, it's true
The thought of something borrowed
Something blue
Was something that I never could pursue

But now you're here
My doubt has disappeared
The clouds are gone..it's clear

[CHORUS]

Even on the coolest nights
Even when the sun won't shine
It's sweeter in the morning time
Just knowing that you're there

[CHORUS]
