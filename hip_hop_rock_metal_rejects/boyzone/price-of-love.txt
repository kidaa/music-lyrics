Fumbling round now in the dark
I hear the banging from my heart
I'm getting so close to you
Looking like I found the clue
And am I sentimental crazy
And is this what we want

And that's the price of love
And do I have enough
And that's the price of love
And do I have enough

A kiss may not be all the truth
But let's just make it what we want
And I will never make a promise
Though I will never tell a lie

And am I sentimental crazy
And is this what we want

And that's the price of love
And do I have enough
And that's the price of love
And do I have enough

Oh yeah do I have enough of your love
Oh yeah do I have enough of your love

And am I sentimental crazy
And is this what we want

And that's the price of love
And do I have enough
And that's the price of love
And do I have enough
And that's the price of love
And do I have enough
