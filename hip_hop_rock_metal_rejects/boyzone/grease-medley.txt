[GREASE IS THE WORD:]
I solve my problems and I see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word
They think our love is just a growin' pain
Why don't they understand it's just a cryin' shame
Their lips are lyin' only real is real
We stop the fight right now
We gotta be who we feel
Grease is the word

Grease is the words is the word
That you heard, it's got groove, it's got meanin'
Grease is the time is the place is the motion
Grease is the way we are feelin'

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance we can make it so far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are

[CHORUS]

This is a life os illusion
Wrapped up in troubles laces in confusion
What are we doin' here

[CHORUS]
Grease is the word is the word is the word..

[SUMMER NIGHTS]
Summer lovin', had me a blast
Summer lovin', happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be

Summer days driftin' away to
Uh-oh those summer nights

Well-a well-a well-a uh
Tell me more tell me more
Didja get very far
Tell me more tell me more
Like does he have a car

She swam by me, she got a cramp
He ran by me, got my suit damp
I saved her life, she nearly drowned
He showed off, splashing around

Summer sun, something's begun
Then uh-oh
Those summer nights

Well-a well-a well-a uh
Tell me more tell me more
Was it love at first sight
Tell me more tell me more
Did she put up a fight

I took her bowling at the arcade
We went strolling, drank lemonade
Then we made out under the dock
We stayed out till ten o'clock

Summer fling, don't mean a thing, but uh-oh
Those summer nights

Woh woh woh
Tell me more tell me more
But ya don't have to brag
Tell me more tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a drag

He got friendly, holding my hand
She got friendly, down in the sand
He was sweet, just turned eighteen
Cos she was good, ya know what I mean

Oh summer heat, boy and girl meet, then
Oh-uh, those summer nights

Woh woh woh
Tell me more tell me more
How much dough did he spend
Tell me more tell me more
Could she get me a friend

It turned colder, that's where it ends
So I told her, we'd still be friends
Then we made our true love vow
Wonder what she's doin' now
Summer dreams, ripped at the seams, but
Ooh! Those summer ni-ights!
Tell me more, tell me more o-ore o-ore
