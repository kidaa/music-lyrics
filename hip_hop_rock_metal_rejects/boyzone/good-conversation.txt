Mac / Graham / Hector
Everybody's so mixed up about love these days
And everybody's trying to work it out in different ways
Well I don't really need to know your aspirations
What I need from you babe
is a good conversation to put my mind at ease
An old friend called the other day, and wasn't quite sure what to say
'Didn't seem to know me anymore, and I said
Don't treat me like I'm someone new
I'm still the same one you use to talk to
But all I need from you friend is good conversation
To put my mind at ease
Though it seems as if the world has come between us
And our lives don't look the same
Though in the past you have shared all my happiness
Will you be there to share the pain
Everyday I'm surrounded million voices from the sky
And they all have the same thing to say
Now what I need is something new is it something you can do to share in
That kind of good conversation that puts my mind at ease
Puts my mind at ease, yer baby
Is it my imagination
And can you see my frustration
I don't need admiration but I'm trying to be patient
What I'm looking for is good conversation
Is it my imagination
Could it be my destination
And what I looking for is good conversation
And what I'm asking for is good conversation
To put my mind at ease
