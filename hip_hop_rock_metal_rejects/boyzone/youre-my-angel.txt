I found my way out of the darkness
After all this time
Now I see your smiling face
Loking back at mine
I was always told
That love can be blind
Now I understand that
Love can be kind
Cos you're my angel
Gotta make you see
I'm the one for you
You're the one for me
Cos you're my angel
I'm gonna let you know
Now I've found you
I'm never letting go
Cos you're my angel

Sometimes I'm empty
I'm weak or in despair
But it's enough to know
That you are always there
And I'll love you cos you
Can see inside my soul
You bring me comfort
When I'm standing
All alone

[CHORUS]

You're my angel and
You're always there
You're always there

I was always told that
Love can be blind
Now I know that love
Can be kind

[Repeat chorus to fade]
