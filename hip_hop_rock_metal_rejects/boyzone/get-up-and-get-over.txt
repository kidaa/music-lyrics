Get up and get over
Any old particular place
Get up and get over
Ain't nobody dragging me down
nobody, nobody
Don't you know that
Hey, it's a great day
Wake an early hour
Get up and take a shower
Pray in some way
Take all the sunny weather
We'll spend the time together
We can take this dream and last forever
We can make it as one

Get up and get over
Show me you want it
Any old particular place
Get up and get over
I know we'll get closer
Ain't nobody dragging me down
nobody, nobody

Get up and get over
Show me you want it
Any old particular place
Get up and get over
I know we'll get closer
Ain't nobody dragging me down
nobody, nobody

Don't you know that plain name like Jane
Never no doubt about it
She won't live without it
I say it's a fine way
To have you home by eleven
When we're in seventh heaven
That we can take this dream and last forever
We can make it as one

[CHORUS X 2 to fade]
