I never meant to hurt you baby
I didn't wanna cause you any pain
But you never knew how I felt now honey
And you know you didn't even know why
So I wanna put my heart in it's place
And I wanna be the person that you fell in love with
I've been told there'll be another
or so they say
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears and I'll face my fears
I've been told there'll be another

A cry for help will sound the same now baby
And I know that people just don't change
But I guess you can't hope
And wish they will yeah
So I wanna put my heart in its place
And I wanna be the person that you fell in love with

I've been told there'll be another
or so they say
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears and I'll face my fears
I've been told there's be another

So I wanna scream and tell myself it'll be okay
And in a final verse I'll tell you what I wanna say

I've been told there'll be another
or so they say
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears and I'll face my fears
I've been told there's be another

So I guess I'm still learning..
