Take a pinch of white man
      Wrap him up in black skin
      Add a touch of blue blood
      And a little bitty-bit of red indian boy..

      Curly, black and kinky
      Oriental sexy
      If you lump it all together
      Well, you've got a recipe for a get-along scene
      Oh what a beautiful dream
      If it could only come true
      You know, you know..

      What we need is a great big melting pot
      Big enough to take the world and all it's got
      Keep it stiring for a hundred years or more
      Turning out coffee-colored people by the score

      Rappers in the fires
      Bishops and the gurus
      We had the Beatles and the Sun-Gods
      a long time ago it's true
      But then it really didn't matter
      What religion you choose
      No no no

      Mick and Lady Faithful
      and everyone who's graceful
      You know the living could be tasteful
      Why don't we all get together in a lovin' machine
      I'd better call up the Queen
      It's only fair that she know
      You know, you know..

      CHORUS X 2 to fade
