Oh yeah!
Your love is temptation
Racing through my veins
Temptation
Stop playing silly games
Temptation
Ain't that a crying shame
Temptation
To me
Some call it evolution
I just call it odd
All these indecisions
People playing God
And Heaven and earth can take one piece of me
But I'm taking all of you

And so
Your love is temptation
Racing through my veins
Temptation
Stop playing silly games
Temptation
Ain't that a crying shame
Temptation
To me

I got a crazy notion
Something's coming over me yeah
You gave me some kind of potion
Now I've lost reality
Heaven and earth can take one piece of me
But I'm taking all of you

And so
Your love is temptation
Racing through my veins
Temptation
Stop playing silly games
Temptation
Ain't that a crying shame
Temptation

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
To me
Temptation
To me
Temptation

Heaven and earth can take one piece of me
But I'm taking all of you

And so
Temptation
Temptation
Stop playing silly games
Temptation
Ain't that a crying shame
Temptation
Your love is temptation
Racing through my veins
Temptation
Stop playing silly games
Temptation
Ain't that a crying shame
Temptation
To me
