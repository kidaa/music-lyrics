Alone just sitting there
      Thinking of you till it hurts
      You're young, so innocent
      Without a care in the world
      You're there but not visible
      My expectations become

      But do you think it's right?
      And do you think it's right?
      Crying in the night
      For crying in the night
      ooh in the night

      My road was different
      There's so much that you have to learn
      A little hand in mine
      And all the smiles and laughter is fine
      Wherever I'll be, land or sea
      I will care for you

      CHORUS

      Each day provides it's own gifts
      Time brings all to pass
      Writing comes more easily
      When you've got something to say

      You're young and beautiful
      Have no enemy but time
      In time, take time
      When time does last
      For time is no time
      When time is passed

      CHORUS to fade
