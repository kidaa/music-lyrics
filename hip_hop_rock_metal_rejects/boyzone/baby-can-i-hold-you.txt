Sorry,is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry,like sorry......
Forgive me,is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me,forgive me.....
Chorus:
But you can say baby
Baby can i hold you tonight
Baby if I told you the right words
Oooh,at the right time
Will you be mine
I love you,is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you,I love you.....
Repeat Chorus2x
Baby if I told you,baby can i hold you
Will you be mine
Baby if I told you,baby can I hold you
Will you be mine
Baby if I told you
Baby can I hold you........
