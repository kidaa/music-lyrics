Evan Rogers / Carl Sturken / Ronan Keating

I woke up this morning
With a brand new point of view
Something has changed my world
And girl that something is you
I don't know how to explain it
But I knew right from the start
This feelin' inside, it can't be denied
And I'm gonna win your heart
One kiss at a time
Sooner or later, love's gonna get you
No way that you can hide
One kiss at a time
Minute by minute, hour by hour
I'm gonna make you mine
One kiss at a time

In all of the heavens
You're the only star that shines
And I've just gotta get to you
So I'm workin' overtime
I don't know how to explain it
But I knew right from the start
This feelin' inside, it can't be denied
And I'm gonna win your heart
One kiss at a time
Sooner or later, love's gonna get you
No way that you can hide
One kiss at a time
Minute by minute, hour by hour
I'm gonna make you mine
One kiss at a time
Hey now, Hey now
Can't believe the way I feel now, feel now
Hey now, Hey now
Can't believe the way it's real now, real now
I've climbed every mountain
Just to show you that I care
The searchin' is done, and girl you're the one
I'm gonna take you there
One kiss at a time
Sooner or later, love's gonna get you
No way that you can hide
One kiss at a time
Minute by minute, hour by hour
I'm gonna make you mine
One kiss at a time
