Keating / Hedges / Brannigan
I never meant to hurt you baby
I didn't wanna cause you any pain
But you never knew how I felt now honey
And you know you didn't even know why

So I wanna put my heart in its place
And I wanna be the person that you fell in love with
I've been told there'll be another or so they say
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears and I'll face my fears
I've been told there'll be another
A cry for help will sound the same now baby
And I know that people just don't change
But I guess you can't hope and wish they will be year
So I wanna put my heart in its place
And I wanna be the person that you fall in love with
I've been told there'll be another or so they say
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears and I'll face my fears
I've been told there'll be another
So I wanna scream and tell myself
It'll be okay
And in a final verse I'll tell you
What I wanna say
I've been told there'll be another or so they say
But I guess never like the other
So I'll shed my tears and I'll face my fears
I've been told there'll be another
So I guess I'm still learning
