It's time that you know
It's now that you show
It's now that you show
That we are one
that we are one
How in the world can we speak in one language
Can you even count all the voices to hear
How in the world can we speak in one language
Let all the people be heard loud and clear

In handshakes and high fives
Slow dances
With stolen kisses
Romances
In stares and smiling faces

How in the world can we speak in one language
How do you say
Say you understand

It's time that you know
It's now that you show
It's now that you show
That we are one
that we are one
It's time that you know
It's now that you show
Let us speak as one
Let's speak as one...yeah

It's time that you know
It's now that you show
Let us speak as one
Let's speak as one...

In tapping your feet
To a different beat
In humming a song
To find where words belong

[CHORUS]
