Will you understand
Will you understand
Dead on a Wednesday morning
Trying to make sense of it all
Shall I go round to your place
Shall I just give you a call
I'm running across the ceiling
Climbing up the wall
Funny how I never knew
That I could ever fall

But I know it's late
And I know that I'm wrong
Won't you hear me now
'Cos I'm coming on strong

But I know it's late
And it won't take long
Won't you hear me now
Together we belong

When will you understand
It's out of my hands
I can't stop loving you
Oh hear me now

When you see what I am
And understand
That I'm a fool for you
Fool for you
I am

Will you understand

Ran from here yesterday
Left it all behind
Got to your gate feeling bad
Crazy in my mind
Found your key, pushed the door
Moved a little inside
Looked around saw your room
But you I didn't find

But I know it's late
And I know that I'm wrong
Won't you hear me now
'Cos I'm coming on strong

But I know it's late
And it won't take long
Won't you hear me now
Together we belong

When will you understand
It's out of my hands
I can't stop loving you
Oh hear me now

When you see what I am
And understand
That I'm a fool for you
Fool for you
I am
I am

Will you understand
Will you understand

Are you gonna
Are you gonna, gonna, gone

When will you understand
It's out of my hands
I can't stop loving you
Oh hear me now

When you see what I am
And understand
That I'm a fool for you

It's not a game to me
It's not a game to me
It's true love
I'm seeing you there

When will you understand
It's out of my hands
I can't stop loving you
Oh hear me now

It's not a game to me
It's not a game to me
It's true love

When you see what I am
And understand
That I'm a fool for you
Fool for you
Will you understand

It's not a game to me
It's not a game to me
It's true love..[fade out]
