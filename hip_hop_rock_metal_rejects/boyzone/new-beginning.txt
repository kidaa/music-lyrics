Seven years of waiting
Seven years of holding on
Yes it's been
Yes it's been...
Always kept my faith in
Always knew this day would come
Let everybody know...

It's time for a new beginning
Oh oh oh yeah
I'm living my life
Yeah
It's time for a new beginning
Yeah-eah-eah oh

There's a new day coming
I'm getting ready for a change
Yes I am

Gotta keep on running
Gotta be a better way
Yes there is

Gotta do what's in your heart
Say what's on your mind
Everybody
Gotta be true to myself
I feel now that it's my time
Let everybody know...yeah

It's time for a new beginning
I'm living my life
It's time for a new beginning
