I don't need any money
and I guess you think that's funny
I got all I need right here with you
I don't need no fancy car
No turbo charge no super charge
None of that means anything to me
[Cos]
I've got you every second every minute
I've got you every second every minute
I've got you every second every minute

[Baby]
I've got you every second every minute
I've got you every second every minute
I've got you
You and me

I don't need a mansion
With a room for each occasion
Cos I got all I want right here with you
I ain't got no time for fashion
No Georgio no Calvin
None of those mean anything to me

[Cos]
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
every second every minute I've got you

[Baby]
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
You and me
oooh

You're the only one for me
Cos you got everything I need
Nothing else means anything to me

[Cos]
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
every second every minute I've got you

[Baby]
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
I've got you every second every minute I've got you
You and me
oooh
