Yesterday yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh..I believe in yesterday
Sorry sorry
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh..I believe in yesterday

Why..she..had to go
I don't know
She wouldn't stay she wouldn't stay

I said something wrong
Now I long for
Yesterday...yesterday.
