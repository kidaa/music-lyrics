I may not need to sail the ocean
I've got no need to sail a mountain high
but there'll be no time
I won't need you
by my side.
you can depend on my love forever
you can be sure baby, sure baby
I'll never not need you
never not care
I'll never not need to
always be there
no I'll never stop loving you the way that I do
no matter what you do
I'll never not want you
sharing my life
never not need to feel
your touch at night,
no there's one thing I will never not do
I'll never not need you
never not need you baby
I don't want no one else's kisses
I'll never hunger for another's touch
and there'll be no one
else this heart will ever love
you can be sure I am your forever
'cause you are my world baby world baby
I'll never not need you
never not care
I'll never not need to
always be there
no I'll never stop loving you the way that I do
no matter what you do
I'll never not want you
sharing my life
never not need to feel
your touch at night,
no there's one thing I will never not do
I'll never not need you
never not need you baby
I don't need the whole world at my feet,
but I will always need you loving me
you're just so much a part of me
I'll stop breathing before I ever stop needing you
repeat chorus
