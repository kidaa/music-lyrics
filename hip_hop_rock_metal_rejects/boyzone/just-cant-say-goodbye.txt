Here I'm standing like an open book
In front of you - my page is turning
Pick a chapter babe, and take a look
What do you see
Maybe now you're learning
My heart's breaking only you can stop
The pain I feel, I can't give up
I ask the question that I need to know
Won't you listen to me

Please don't walk away - leave me behind
With these crazy feelings
No one is to blame - ain't that a shame
But I still believe in you, oh you
You're my every dream come true
That is why
I just can't say goodbye

Here I'm lying in my bed alone
What do I feel - another page is turning
Once again another chapter's closed
And in my mind I see our bridge is burning

I am falling and I can't get up
Seems so far to reach the top
The way I feel for you will never stop
Won't you Listen to me

[CHORUS]

Don't wanna walk away
Don't wanna let you down
Don't wanna see you crying
Just wanna see you smile

I'll never walk away
I'll never let you down
I'll never leave you crying
I just can't say goodbye

[CHORUS]

Oh babe, you, oh you
You're my every dream come true
And that is why
I just can't say goodbye
And that is why
I just can't say goodbye
