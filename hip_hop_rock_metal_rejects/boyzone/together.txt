Together, it's better by far
That's what we are, you'll see
Now that we're together
It's better by far
That's what we are, you'll see
Don't hold me up, cos I'm moving out
Everywhere I go, you always block my road
I'm on that train, where will it go
North, East, West or South
Found by word of mouth

We've got to change the way we feel
From the start
I loved you way back then
And I'll love you once again

[CHORUS]

When we were small, they always said
We would be together, always and forever
Then you changed your pretty way
I will take it no more
My feet ain't stuck to the floor

We've got to change the way we feel
From the start
I loved you way back when
And I'll love you once again

[CHORUS]

I sometimes lose myself
For eternity
I find my way back somehow
And face the plain reality...
Together we're meant to be

[repeat CHORUS to fade]
