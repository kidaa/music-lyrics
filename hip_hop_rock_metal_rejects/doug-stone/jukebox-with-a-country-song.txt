Otis Rush

I want to make violent love
To you by the moon above
I want to make violent love to you

I want to kiss every night
And hold and hug you tight
I want to make violent love to you

I don't want to be frantic
I don't want to cramp your style
You're driving me into a panic
You almost drive me wild

I want to make whoopee too
And have a little fun with you
I want to make violent love to you

- Solo -

I don't want to be frantic
I don't want to cramp your style
You're driving me into a panic
You almost drive me wild

I want to make whoopee too
And have a little fun with you
I want to make violent love to you
