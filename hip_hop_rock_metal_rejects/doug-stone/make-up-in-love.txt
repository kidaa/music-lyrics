I walked on London Bridge last night
I saw you by the lamppost light
Then bells rang out in sleepy Londontown
And London Bridge came tumbling down

The sky was hidden by a mist
But just like magic when we kissed
The moon and stars were shining all around
When London Bridge came tumbling down

Just you and I over the river
Two hearts suspended in space
And there so high over the river
A miracle tookplace

Two empty arms found love to hold
Two smoke rings turned to rings of gold
I bless the night we met in Londontown
When London Bridge came tumbling down

Just you and I over the river
Two hearts suspended in space
And there so high over the river
A miracle took place

I bow my head in silent prayer
And thank Him for the love we share
He blessed the night we met in Londontown
When London bridge came tumbling down
