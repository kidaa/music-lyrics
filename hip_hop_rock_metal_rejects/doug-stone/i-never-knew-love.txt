She wore an S.E.G. when she came back home
Like the cat that ate the canary
And I stood befuddled, a chauvanist stud
With his mistress quite contrary
I was smack up against the moment
I was afraid i would face someday
But the truth is a wall that you can't blow down
And it won't be laughed away

You see, my old lady went and took herself
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said,
Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light,
She said,  It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.

Now I admit my imagination's been
The sweetest sinner of all
Yes it lives like a snake in Eden
And it forgives each time I fall
So I've been Casanova
I've double-dated with Don Juan
And though I've been doing almost everything
I never dreamed she'd be carrying on!

You see, my old lady went and took herself
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said,
Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light,
She said,  It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.

She says that she still loves me
She says that last night was no big deal
She says,  Why can't a woman play the same damn game
And act out what she feels?
She says she's going to take a bath
I hear her singing in the tub upstairs
While I'm sitting here spitting out chunks of my heart
Forced into being fair,
While she's splashing rround up there,
I'm supposed to act like I don't care,
I hear the devil laughing somewhere!

You see, my old lady went and took herself
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said,
Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light,
She said,  It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.
