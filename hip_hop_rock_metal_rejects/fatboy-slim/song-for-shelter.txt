I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deeper huh. 
Into this thing. 

The deeper I go, 
The more knowledge I know. 

What to sing? 
What to bring? 
What?

I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deeper, deeper, deeper 
Into the vibe, 
What? ??? 

Chilling in the corner, 
At the shelter all built myself, 
Checkin' it out 
And dancing no more, ??? 
But, ??? What? 

How on Earth? 
Are you supposed to vibe around the thing 
??? the one that say: 
They know what is what, 
But they don't know what is what, 
They just struck. 
What the fuck? 

What?
I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deeper, 
Into this thing, 
And I pretend, 
That they're not there. 
I just there, 
Up in the boot 
That the dread man spinning the song 
Spinning it strong 
Playing things like: 
We ??? house we can. 

That's my shit, what? 

I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deep, 
I get deeper 
When people start to disappear, 
It is about six o'clock, 
I'm pulling high, 
Take off my sweater and my pants, 

And i start the dance, 
And all the ?sweat is going down my bass?. 

And I pretend that, 
There's nobody near 
Like we in this place. 

I get deep, yo 
I get deep 
What?

I get deep 
I get deep 
I get deep 
When it takes all the bass after song 
When all you hear is ??? 
And this like... 
Aah
I get deep 
I get deep 
???

And i get drunk, and i'm over the place 
???
And i catch myself right on time 
Right on line, ??? 
And it so sweat sweat sweat 

I get deep 
I get deep 
Where the house music was ??? 
??????
And it only takes deep breath 
???
Rhythms and bass 
I get deep 

And now it's about 3 8 90 
????
Swim and jump ??? rounding 
As they said ??? 
Winds on their feet 
Raising ??? in the air 
And ??? Jesus was the DJ ??? 
Funky funky house beats 
And in this ?temple? we are playing 
??? for the same thing 
We've made it ??? without ??? 
Bass from those ??? speakers 
???
Giving ??? boom-boom-boom to ??? zoom-zoom-zoom 
???
Speak to me speak to me 
Because we love house music 
And all this planet ??? us together 
I compare ??? every week 
???

She said I wanna go out on a picknick with you baby, 
Under the big bright yellow sun 

You guys, just keep it rollin'
