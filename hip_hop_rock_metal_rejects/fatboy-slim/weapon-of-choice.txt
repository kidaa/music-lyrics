Don't be shy by the tone of my voice 
Just got my new weapon, the weapon of choice 

Don't be shy by the tone of my voice 
Just got my new weapon, the weapon of choice 

Listen to the sound of my voice 
I can chicken al loud, it's the weapon of choice 

Don't be shy by the tone of my voice 
It's the new weapon, the weapon of choice 

[2x Chorus:] 
You can go with this, 
Or you can go with that, 
You can go with this, 
Or you can go with that, 
You can go with this, 
Or you can go with that, 
Or you can throw with us [only the 1st time] 

Walk without rhythm 
it won't attract the worm 

Walk without rhythm 
and it won't attract the worm 

Walk without rhythm 
and it won't attract the worm 

If you walk without rhythm 
ah, you never learn 

Don't be shy by the tone of my voice 
Just got my new weapon, weapon of choice 

Don't be shy by the tone of my voice 
Just got my new weapon, weapon of choice 

Be careful, we don't know them 
Be careful, we don't know them 
Be careful, we don't know them 

[2x Chorus] 

Oh, Mary we won't do the ??? 
Too big love to the angels of lie 
Yeah, and my girl 

She just don't understand 
is gone beyond being a man 

??? 
??? 
but I'm going to hold my cool, 
because of easy rules 

Yeah, so move on baby, yeah 

Halfway between the gutter and the stars, yeah 
Halfway between the gutter and the stars, yeah 

[2x Chorus]
