Like a sniper, I've got my sights on you,
Windscreen wiper, there ain't no spoiling my view,
Silver bandoleer, my profession's clear,
Sharpshooter

Infra red vein, don't you come out at night,
Infra red chain, you're gonna buy your life,
Silver pistol too, with a notch for you,
Sharpshooter

You're the contract, I'm gonna nail you down,
I'm the contact, with your final round,
And I'm stalking you, and that ain't all I do,
Sharpshooter
