Well I've never done nothing,
That's ever gonna shame my life,
Come around any time you like honey,
There ain't no shame in my bed at night

Long legged lover,
I'm gonna rip you Limb From Limb,
Get you smashed as a rat in some bar,
Sink my claws into your velvet skin

Harsh, cruel words babe,
They're gonna cut me like a knife,
I don't care what the hell you call me,
But are ya still coming round tonight
