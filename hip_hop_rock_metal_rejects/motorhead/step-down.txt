Well I'll see you later, but I don't know when,
Don't know if I'm coming, coming round again,
But I don't care, that they might stare,
I know I mustn't Step Down

I ain't no beauty, but I'm a secret fox,
I'm gonna put all my presents, inside my favourite box,
And then so long, the universal song,
I know I mustn't Step Down
