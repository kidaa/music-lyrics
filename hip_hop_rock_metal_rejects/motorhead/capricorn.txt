A thousand nights, I've spent alone,
Solitaire, to the bone,
But I don't mind, I'm my own best friend,
From the beginning, to the end,
My life, my heart, black night, dark star, Capricorn

December's child, the only one,
What I do, is what I've done,
I realise, I get so cold,
When I was young I was already old,
My life, my heart, black night, dark star, Capricorn

I always knew, the only way,
Is never live, beyond today,
They proved me right,
They proved me wrong,
But they could never last this long,
My life, my heart, black night, dark star, Capricorn
