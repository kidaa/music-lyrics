I can tell, seen before,
I know the way, I know the law,
Can't believe, can't obey,
Can't agree with all the things I hear you say,
Oh no, don't ask me why,
I can't go on with all these filthy white lies, Stay Clean

Don't you know, all the time,
You got yours and you know that I've got mine,
Grab a hold, don't let go,
Don't let them rob you of the only thing you know,
Oh no, no-one else,
Got the right to make you sorry for yourself, Stay Clean

So you see, the only proof,
Of what you are is in the way you see the truth,
Don't be scared, live to win,
Although they're always gonna tell you it's a sin,
In the end, you're on your own,
And there is no-one that can stop you being alone, Stay Clean.
