Hello victims!

I can almost taste it,
It's the need to see you die,
You thought you had it made,
Well here's your final shock surprise,
How do you like it,
My unfaithful friend
How do you like it
How do you like my Sweet Revenge

Turn the key in the door,
No one close to hear you scream,
You'll never imagine the pain,
Even in you're foulest dreams,
How do you like that
Invitation friend
How do you like that
That's what I call my Sweet Revenge

So sweet to see you,
Writhe and crawl and scream for life,
But I can't listen now,
I'm too busy with the knife,
I don't hear you laughing,
My dismembered friend,
I don't hear you laughing,
You don't like my Sweet Revenge
