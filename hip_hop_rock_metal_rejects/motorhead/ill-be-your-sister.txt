I'll Be Your Sister, be your lover yeah,
Be your mother, if you need somebody,
If you need someone to love,
I'm the one you should be thinking of,
If you need somebody, I'm your hand in glove

I'll be your lover, be your sister maybe,
I'll be your mother, if you need it baby,
If you think that it's the end,
I'm gonna prove I can come back again,
If you need somebody, I'm your only friend

I'll be your mother, I'll be your lover,
Be your sister, be your lover yeah,
If you need someone, you're feeling tired,
Need someone to set your heart on fire,
It's so lonely, hanging on the wire.
