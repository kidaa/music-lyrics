The only thing I know, is playing rock 'n' roll,
I'm not a business man, I'm just in a good time band,
You don't let no-one know, just where the money goes,
Because of parasites, I ain't got no rights,
All The Aces, I don't like people who ain't got no faces

You know I don't know why, you have to be so sly,
One thing I learned, I don't get what I earn,
But you get your share, though you ain't nowhere,
You get no wiser, but then I despise you,
All The Aces, don't like people who ain't got no faces

You know you're the boss, but I'm the one it costs,
Gotta see the books, you give me dirty looks,
You know you make me vomit, and I ain't far from it,
You know you can rob me, but you can't stop me,
All The Aces, don't like people who ain't got no faces
