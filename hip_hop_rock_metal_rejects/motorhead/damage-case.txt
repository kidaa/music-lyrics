Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
I'm on the run from some institution
All I want's a little consolation
And I can tell by your face
I'm a total disgrace
Let me inside your place
Move over for a Damage Case

Hey babe wait a minute stop
Don't run away don't call the cops
I ain't looking to victimise you
All I want to do is tantalise you
And I can tell by your face
I'm all over the place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a Damage Case

Hey babe don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow I'm gone today
I don't even care what you think your game is
I don't even care what your name is
And I can tell by your face
You're all over the place
Let me inside your place
Move over for a Damage Case
