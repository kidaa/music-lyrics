People tell me you didn't know better,
Give me sermons 'bout the things I do,
Come to love 'em, even wrote letters,
You know I even asked it of you, I said,
I've been doing Poison,
I guess I poisoned my life,
I've been doing Poison,
it's better than marrying your wife

On the road, the pace is getting frantic,
Specially when your poisoned out your mind,
A flight of stairs is like swimming the Atlantic,
When you're poisoned, deaf, dumb and blind,
I take my poison,
I guess I poisoned my life,
Been doing Poison,
I wish I'd Poisoned my wife

My Father, he used to be a Preacher,
Never taught me nothing but scorn,
If I ever catch him on the street, yeah,
I'll make him wish he'd never been born,
He was Poison,
Guess he poisoned my life
He was Poison,
I wish my mother wasn't his wife, no!
