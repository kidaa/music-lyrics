Y.J. Malmsteen/Y.J. Malmsteen5:53
In the darkness they will gather
Conjuring the One

Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice

Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointed daggers shine

Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The Dreaded One will rise

Rise... Burn... Rise

Nobody knows who's the disciples of Hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping Darkness and Lucifer's sonVictims of the grand illusions
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searhing for the Key

Nobody knows who's the disciples of Hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping Darkness and Lucifer's son

Raise your cup and praise the Prince of Darkness
See the truth of the Power eithin the Beast
And when the Time has come
The Gate of Hell shall open

Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice

Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The Dreaded One will rise

Nobody knows who's the disciples of Hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping Darkness and Lucifer's son
