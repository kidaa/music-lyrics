Y.J. Malmsteen/Y.J. Malmsteen, J.S. Soto4:24
I see visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?

Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win

I'll see the light, tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life, tonight

Now, the chaos has begoun, people crying out
You're alone, you gotta run

Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No, we never had a chanceI'll see the light, tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life, tonight

I'll see the light, tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life, tonight

Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win

Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No, we never had a chance

I'll see the light, tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life, tonight
