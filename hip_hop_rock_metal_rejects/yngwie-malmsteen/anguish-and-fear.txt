No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed

Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find

Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they've forgotten to rest and to die

Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to findNo more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed

Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find

Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
