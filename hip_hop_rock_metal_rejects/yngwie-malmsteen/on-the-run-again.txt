Y.J. Malmsteen/J.S. Soto3:22
Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine and song
Never still, always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun

Now he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay

Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes join to hunt him down
For his head lies a mighty pricce
He's a wanted man, dead or aliveWhere will he go from here
He's on the run again... nowhere... no, no...

He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead

He's on the run, again...
He's on the run, again...
He's on the run, again...
He's on the run, again...
Tell me when will it end
