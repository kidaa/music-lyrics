I deny your wretched lifestyle
Who am I to fool myself?
A distant cry of help from others
A child's brain, a world of greed
It's all around you, can't you see?
Are you blind to the like of me?
Politician, I see through your charade
Speaking all your brainless lies, you're all the same
Mister preacher, tell me what is right
Send the double figures, son, you'll see the light
Look into the distant future
will they have a tax on nature?
How much more will still remain?
They actually call themselves humane
I deny all you see
I don't have to belief
It's god's way, says your horrid wife
Embezzling, indulging
I believe your nose is growing
Extorting, not reporting
Your pockets are overflowing
Tell us one more thing
How much more holiness did you bring?
I see right through you
Soon they all will too
