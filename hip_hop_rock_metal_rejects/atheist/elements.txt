I tip my head to the creation
And its rewarding disposition
Formed by something
Lacking nothing here
Something so divine
A spectacle of "Elements"
Enjoying all the warmth of fire
Longing for the breeze of morning air
Douse myself with the purest water
Something so divine
The spectacle of Elements
As storms approach the mineral
Bringing the nutrients for the green
They feed the lakes of our mother Earth
Sharing forces for the living
Yes the caption seems to be complete
Our gratitude lacks sincerity
We filter our pollution through the selfish
Declaration of only our independence,
Not concerned about the Elements!
