Enter this thought in your mind
We all were put here for mankind
To serve and obey a so-called lord
The price we must pay we can't afford
Evangelistic politics
No matter how much pain the might inflict
Now that this thought has set in
Wake up and realize this brutal sin
Unholy war
Thaught to pray for
Plaguing scandal
Unholy war
Religion pays in godly ways, education's not a factor
Sit there brainwashed, insecurity
Preaching life and immortality
Criminal in their ways
To reach eight million in just thirty days
Thrive on mindless human beings
An easy target, so it seems
Unholy war
Thaught to pray for
Plaguing scandal
Unholy war
