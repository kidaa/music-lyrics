Lyrics: Shaefer
Music: Atheist
I've scaled over the walls of morality
Not quite sure what I'd find
There on the other side
Waiting in a common stance
Relieve me of my duty
As keeper of this body
Just leave me with my mind
And I assure you
I will be just fine
Tears stream from cheek
Of a man whose body his mind does not seek
A very gruelling rendition
Of a human soul's indecision
The qualities of a finer being
Locked well within this shell
Crying out to be released
To a body that serves as well
Malformed at birth
You see what it's worth
In a mirror I ask why
Such a shame, wanting to die
In a past lifetime
I feel I've had mine
Shared with no one
Excuse me I must go now !
Unhappy as he exits
Unhappy as he came
Enthralled in the Essence
The Essence of life to be

AN INCARNATION'S DREAM
Lyrics: Schaefer
Music: Atheist
It all seems so strange
The mutes the bums
The dogs with mange, the poor,
Doesn't anybody help themselves anymore
I guess not
Barefoot pregnant women
Little kids with snot on their face
A land of plenty, a dynasty of disgrace !
I'll manifest for you
Careening on the outer limits of reality
My mission to create a better galaxy
I must not fail them now,
I look inside to see that it's clear
Living life is just not enough
You must persevere
Please grab hold
Not to things that are bought
But to things that cannot be sold,
Then you'll see
You're released by trial and error
The world's prophecy is to learn
A candle lit from the bottom
Will soon start to burn
Don't dignify, a false spy in the sky
Re-route your path
With the blink of an eye
Walking around with a mind of your own
With a glance to the past
You can see we have grown
How much we have grown
It's been my dream
To enter the stream
To let carnates know
What life really means
If one understands
That's all I can ask
Life to you
is such a wretched task !
