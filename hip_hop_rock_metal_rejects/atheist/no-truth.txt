I am my own self-ruler
I need not any ministry
I see our music scares you
Can't you see that...
There's no truth in modern religion, a god we do not praise
There's no truth in heaven or hell or what lies between
There's no truth in a man-made bible, so who are they to say?
There's no truth, we are our own god and that's the only way
People live their lives
By something never seen
Dreaming all their lives
Of a place they've never been
Why can't you see live a lie?
Humor yourself until you die
We're atheist as you can see
We all control our can see
There's no truth
