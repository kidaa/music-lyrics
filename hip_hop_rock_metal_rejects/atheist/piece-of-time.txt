A blast of light is emerging, a soul prepared to learn
Its classroom, our earth, enlightment it yearns
Receiving the life and knowledge it deserves
A spectrum of warmth, a soul is life-preserved
Please don't think that when you die
You'll spend eternity up high
When what you really ought to know
Is just how far your life will go
Another notch in a cosmic climb
Reveal our sanity, reveal your plan divine
To grasp reality is to grasp your biggest fear, you see
Every circumstances is very meant to be
Is your life not the life that you want it to be?
Your soul is young, it lacks response to the things you see
Some must learn the hard way, but that's what they need
When all is learned in this life, your soul will proceed
Another notch in a cosmic climb
Reveal our sanity, reveal your plan divine
To grasp reality is to grasp your biggest fear, you see
Every circumstances is very meant to be
Piece of time
Piece of time
Here we stand at a hallway with nothing but open doors
Venture in your human existence awaits there for you
It's your piece of time
