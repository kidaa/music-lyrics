Stop and look around at politics
No, nothing's changed, it still remains
The same old fear, the things we hear
I've heard enough, I won't adhere
Why bother voting
It won't do us any good
Octogenarian leaders
Telling us they would
I know that there's got to be a way
There's not that much that you or I can say
To make a dent in the land of the free
The darker side of life they never see
Election time is here, but do you care?
It's not our choice, we cannot voice
If they won't hear, the issue's clear
A more modern plan to run this land
