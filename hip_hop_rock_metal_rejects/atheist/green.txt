Suddenly all turns to green!!
whisper And a forest cracks a smile
*A seed conceals an important part
Of the way we see, the world is ought to be
Plants and trees, initiate the air we breathe
And give us more than they receive
*Often times, rooting their stability
The way that they ought to be
But sometimes cut down!
*In recent years, the peace upon the greenery
Has fallen to machinery
Tree sap tears, dried upon the slaughtered
Bark,
Yes man has really made his mark
It's plain to see, the land as it used to be
Is gone for eternity
The cypress cries loud!!
Beauty bears the colour green!!
