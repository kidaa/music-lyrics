Survival below the forest line
Becomes what can't be taken away
Trip through the vines of the food chain
He who doesn't stumble remains the
Dominant of the jungle
The leader of the wooded domain
A defence provides the needed acceptance
To camouflage themselves as animal!!!
Size seems not to matter here
To keep your territory clear
Through all will challenge you just the same
It's will and indistinct to remain the
Dominant of the jungle
The leader of the wooded domain
A defence provides the needed acceptance
To camouflage themselves as animal!!!
Separating weak from the strong
With no points in between
Crawling, walking, climbing, stalking
It's necessary for the predator.
