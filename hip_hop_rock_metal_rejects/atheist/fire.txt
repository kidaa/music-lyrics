Feeling the heat that captures
The warmth that see the chance
Imagine the stonelit contortion
Sprawling itself at a glance anger!!
Shadows shaded yellow
Both shredded and tapered flames
Reaching at a constant level
Rising, rising, "Combustion"!!!
The blue light at the bottom
Surely sets the stage
For the radiant dancing
If the flares of the sun
Feel them burn!!!
The heat that you feel is friction
Creating a scar that sees
An everlasting reflection
An everlasting appeal Pain!!!
Shadows shaded yellow
Both shredded and tapered flames
Reaching at a constant level
Rising, rising, "Combustion"!!!
The blue light at the bottom
Surely sets the stage
For the radiant dancing
If the flares of the sun
Feel them burn!!!
