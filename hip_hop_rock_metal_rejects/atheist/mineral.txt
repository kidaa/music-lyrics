Leave us alone, we never harmed you
Leave us alone, we beg of you
How could you be, so unforgiving
Without it you see, you won't be living
To see the creator
Compiled of mineral & sea
If given a voice, we'd lash out at you
If given a choice, we'd educate you
A blossoms remorse, could never shine through
The need it attracts, when you're given
The choice of becoming what you need to be
A choice of cradling the creator of mineral and sea
The holding of the bones, of the treasured
Allows us to peel, somewhat insightful
Of course it should be with due respect
For after all, we are all mineral!
Leave us alone, we never harmed you Leave us alone - 2X
Leave us alone, we beg of you Leave us alone - 2X
How could you be, so unforgiving Leave us alone - 2X
Without it you see, you won't be living Leave us alone - 2X
To see the creator
Compiled of mineral and sea!
The choice of becoming what you need to be
The choice of cradling the creation
spoken Of mineral and sea!
