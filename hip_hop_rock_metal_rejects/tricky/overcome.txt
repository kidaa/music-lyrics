You sure you want to be with me? 
I've nothing to give. 
Won't lie and say this loving's best 
Whoa, leave us in emotional peace 
Mmm, take a walk take a rest, a taste of this. 

Don't wanna be on top of your list, 
Monopoly improperly kissed 
We overcome in sixty seconds the strength we had together. 
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed. 
And when there's trust there'll be treats 
When we funk we'll hear beats.

You and her, walking through the suburbs 
No, not exactly lovers 
You're a couple, 'specially when your bodies double. 
Duplicate and then you wait 
For the next Kuwait.
