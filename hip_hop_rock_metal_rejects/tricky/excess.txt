Tricky: 
I believe in 
I deceive in 
Bottom weaving 
I can breathe in 
Make a wish in 
Flower fishing 
moving vibration 
Mild relation 
I'm Jamaican on your radio station 
Got a curse in 
Could be worse in 
You first 
In a hearse in 
Good as dead in 
Nothing left in 
Nothing left in 
Some be heading 
I need a head rest in 
And a feed from a warm breast 
A man making hits 
For the childhood of hicks 
Underground like 
Who's it sound like 
You all sound the same 
But you don't know my name 

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people lying 
I believe in people dying 
I believe in people trying 
I believe in people crying 
I believe in people balking 
I believe in people talking 
I believe in people breathing 
I believe in people being 
Keep living 

Tricky: 
Alanis Morissette in the background 
You all sound the same 
But you don't know my name 
Rearrange and things don't change 
Things remain feel the strain 
Stress 
Catch my breath 
Get some rest 
From the mess 
I couldn't care less 
Sugar cane 
Is like smack to my vein 
Shook fame 
But I don't complain 

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in different reasons 
I believe in breath through seasons 
I believe when snow flakes fall 
I believe in buildings tall 
I believe in people bombing 
I believe in people warring 
I believe diseases coming 
I believe that's why I'm running 
Keep living 
Keep living 

Tricky: 
Alanis Morissette in the background 
You gotta ask 
Before he attacks 
You got the flats 
Dub my sacks 
You've got the city 
Move out of the country 
I'm scrunching 
Friends that are punchy 

Stephanie McKay: 
I believe in people falling 
I believe in people warring 
I believe diseases coming 
I believe that's why I'm running 
I believe in people balking 
I believe in people talking 
I believe in people breathing 
I believe in people being. 

Keep living
