One touch of your hand can open the heavens
abducts me to long forgotten meadows of desire
Strange, I never believed that one glance of eyes
Would be able to touch me inside like yours did
I always thought that something was buried
Long time ago, deep inside...
One touch...
...And there never was a greater pleasure
Than to stay awake for hour and hold you tight
To feel your silent breath upon my hand
As I push your hair from your face
And I dare not to wake you
For this would make me, too...
