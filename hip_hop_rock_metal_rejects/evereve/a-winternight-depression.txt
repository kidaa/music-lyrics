Fading light - I see the shadows fall.
I hear the darkness sigh.
As it rises from a dead man's pillow.
Taking his last breath to the winds outside.
Threads of moonlight torch the ground.
Show forms a cover of silence.
Candlelight spreads its wings over my soul.
The flame illuminates the night.
Searching for answers, my mind's deceit.
With myself torn to fragments, my life means defeat.
Where is my saviour?
Why did he leave me alone?
In my winter frost palace where sorrows are sown.
I try to find a way deep into my dreams.
Try to flee from cruel reality.
To be suspended into a sea of emptiness.
And never, never wake up again.
Did you ever hear a dead baby crying in its cradle?
Did you ever see a black sun rising above a silent world?
Did you ever speak words no one would ever hear?
Did you ever scream out what you feel when you see the pain?
I see a new day, the candlelight dies.
The darkness meets the beauty of the light.
