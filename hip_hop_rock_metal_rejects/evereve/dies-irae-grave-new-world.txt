As sirens screamed out in the darkness
And fire fell down from the sky
As we cowered again in the bunker
We all knew the reason why
As our houses lay in ruins
And our sons were shot side by side
As the devil danced upon the graveyard
We all knew who's to blame
"For I am not one of the cowards
For I'm neither mortal nor weak
For I am the one you have longed for
A new master-race forsee"
He that is without sin among you
Let him first cast a stone on you...
Joh. 8,1
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If leaders feed beggars, a nation of beggars will fight
Those you once seduced
Are now here to be crucified
The principle of a fool
Who's betrayed and sacrificed
And to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit,
Up to the ears in blood...
Shakespeare
