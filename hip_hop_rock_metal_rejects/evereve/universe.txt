Give me the sleep I need to forget
My pain and my sorrow, my grief and my dept
Give me the sleep I need to forget
Hypocrisy, cruelty, hatred and if
There's someone to hear me - Then answer my cries
And if you are near me - Please drop your disguise
I need to get out, please show me a way
To cope with my dread and my fear every day
Restricted are my paths, destinations of myself far away
The wheel of life has stopped turning, an angel leads me astray
I am longing for farewell, just a passenger in a boat
A boat called life - after which wave will it lose its load
Void, peace and stillness - Is what I yearned for
Let me be a fallen star - Insignificance is what I will earn
Universe - I want to drift in your eternity
Universe - lay your arms around my soul
Universe - a part of you I want to be
Universe - your star of death I've seen it glow
I want to drift into your eternity - Lay your arms around my soul
A part of you I want to be - Your star of death I've seen it glow
Prepared for your reception
Your timeless nothingness awaits me
Universe - are you a part of me?
A part of you I want to be.
