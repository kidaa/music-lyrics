PASSION AND DEMISE
The sweet draught of lick-her liqour
Runs gently over my tongue
A feast of wicked pleasure
Is the delight of sweat and blood
The seed of a lost morality
As you sow, so shall you reap
A beast of pray prey I am
Trapped in a human abattoir
Now we drift away
Into a proud act of violation
Flesh captures flesh
As we deluge in self-accusation
The seed of...
To copulate means to umiliate
And I tremble within your thighs
I devastate emotional ground
What I adore, I despise
I rape you soul and suck you out
'Til I look into frightened eyes
I'm a prisoner between your legs
In a vicious game of passion and demise
The sweet draught of...
Together we rise, divided we fall
Caressed by the inno-scent innocent
I praise the holy whore...
Passion and demise
