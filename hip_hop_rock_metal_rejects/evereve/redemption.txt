Blessed are the fallen
Hearts full of grief
Blessed are the feeble
Who deny their own belief
I am stranded
Forgotten and forlon
A hangman buried by his fear
See the scarecrows laughing
By jesters mesmerized
Staring at me with cruel lies eyes
So bleed for me
To set me free... right now...
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done... forever...
Will you darken my bride bright sun?
Will you swallow your lost son?
Blessed are the fallen
Hearts full of grief
Blessed are the feeble
Who deny their own belief
So nail me to cross
Then break the seventh seal
Paradise regained by guilt
'Cause the child has grown up now
And innocence is gone
Forgiveness is not running through your vain vein
A spell has been cast on my fevered mind
To bind my mercy to the living
So bleed for me
To set me free
... Right now...
