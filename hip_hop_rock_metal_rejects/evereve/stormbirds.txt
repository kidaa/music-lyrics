Like a storm-driven bird at night
We came flying out of nowhere
And for a moment our wings gleamed
Like gold in the light of fire
And are gone again to the nowhere
The cold grey sea, it waits for me
And the foaming waves call me down
To howling winds and a steel blue sky
But the cold grey sea calls forever
Like gold fall the leaves an the wind
When farewell time, autumn has come
All these years they have passed
Like the wave on the shore of the sea
Time passes, the place I search for
It's still just a longing inside
Something strange and unknown to me
To be grounded somewhere, no longer
A stormbird in shaking and howling
