The downfall - a pleasure to watch it in your arms
Flaming red inferno, we relish the dying horizon
With fiery thorns in your hands
You strike stakes of lust through my heart
When all around us is lit
Our love will gleam like the vital spark
Into an ocean of reddish tears
We glide away, unite our souls
My inflamed skin caressed by your hands
The fever enslaves us again and again...
Thousands of souls torches
Extinct, withered side by side
We are destined to celebrate
The cremation of mankind
Slowly devoured by a gorge of heat
Melted away - the bad depraved seed
Screamed out for help, to heaven they cried
"I declared the earth as purgatory"
All I wanted was to touch the sky,
but I was doomed to fail
Like an anguished child I sank down on my knees
In hopeless desperation I await your final kiss
"His locus est ubi mors gaudet succurrere vitae"
