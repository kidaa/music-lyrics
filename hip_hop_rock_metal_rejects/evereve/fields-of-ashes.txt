Our life flourished amid a brown Mother Earth
Broke through the rocks, broke through straight towards the sun
Stygian light winks through the clouds
Retched into this heart of mine
Shines onto my life from nothingness
And I ravished the rays of sunshine
Unfinished we participate in the run of life, our inner strife
Hidden inside us the need to end, to end our pain
One with nature, spoilt, without a zest for life
Sparkling bodies embraced by ebony nights
"Sometimes all our words are inadequate for the burden of our hearts"
Once ashes we will be and still the hunger for a new life
Or a soon coming death
And the dust we will crumble to will be the companion
Of the four winds wailing over our souls
The ashes still the hunger of a new coming death
The dust is the companion of the four winds from our hearts
