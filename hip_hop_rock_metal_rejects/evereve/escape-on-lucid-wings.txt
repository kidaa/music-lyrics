Another desperate night
Another weary fight
Another guardian angel
Vanished in a lake of flames
Another pale grey stream
Another shattered dream
Another voice that whispers
"...Escape, Escape, Escape... On lucid wings"
Another cross to bear
Another mask to wear
Another cold wind blowing
Over a ploughed ground
Another orphaned field
Another broken shield
Another voice that whispers
"...Escape, Escape, Escape..."
I shall kiss the glowing fun
Carried away forever
I shall taste the golden wine
Carried away forever forever more
"...Escape, Escape, Escape... On lucid wings"
