Do you believe in heaven or do you believe in pain?
A sanctuary built for the mischosen
Is it the final contradiction or just an irony of fate?
Doomed we are to drown in an empty ocean
In Misery's dawn...
Can't you see?
God's forgotten children struggle for their lives
While innocent convictors celebrate the knive
"I'll always be with you" - But I've never really been
On your way back to the gallows, destiny's fulfilled
Misery's dawn
Can't you see?
Misery's dawn
Together from a black sea of stars we shall arise
To fall down once more, failure in disguise
In tragedy's harvest the fruit's a bitter loss
They broke your wings and make you tumble down... at any cost
You burned me with your poisoned seed of doubt
Why do you want me to suffer?
Is this the day of geaven or is this the day of pain?
I closed my heart forever as the blade slowly opened your veins...
Misery's dawn
Can't you see?
This is my private misery
