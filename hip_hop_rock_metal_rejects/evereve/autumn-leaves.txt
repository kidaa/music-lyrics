Been has her being
Urged to the dwelling of your ancestors
All the long way to their resting place
Now your place, nothing left, no more...
Hungering your love lies in a coffin
Can see the laughing vault
Ramdripping on darkened woods
Love's soul is fearlessly sold
Escaped from our world
My elegy accompanies you
She's buried under autumn leaves...
During a howling storm
Dusty claws are grasping at her
Thursting for infinity
This is not her destiny...
