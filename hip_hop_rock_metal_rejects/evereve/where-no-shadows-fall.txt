In a plkce where no shadows fall
I will meet you again
Below the moon and the stars
Where it all began
Where no shadows fall
We will meet again
Where no shadows fall
Where it all began
We all feel the presence
Of our destiny draw near
In this place where no shadows fall
We will have to surrender to our fears
