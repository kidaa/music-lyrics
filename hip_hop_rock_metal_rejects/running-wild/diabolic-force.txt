Scared up raven yells, in the cemetary darkness falls
Smouldering firebowls, from eternity hell's usher howls
Tonight

The vault hears a fatal vow of the preacher veiled in a cowl
He swears the righteous sovereign for an alliance to rouse the flame
Tonight

Diabolic force, occult enemy
Diabolic force, live eternally

He takes the wrought-iron cross, fulfilling the fiend's cause
He breaks beyond's boundary, the fate's sealed on this cemetary
Tonight

The preacher bows his head, sinking he beats all the dread
Falling in a black abyss, hearing the demon's hiss
Tonight

In eternity he waits his path, bedevilled by a certain wrath
Supported by eternal flame, men of hate to tame
Tonight

Vultures of death are flying, under their cry the evil's dying
Destroying society of hate, like thunderstorms they bring their fate
Tonight
