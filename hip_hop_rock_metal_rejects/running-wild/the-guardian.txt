Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Before the darkness, before the light
The guardians' soul stood the sands of time
He ruled the void, he ruled the dark
All came to birth, the holy spark

Watch out, be strong, choose! when the war is on
Watch out, time's long, until all evil is gone

Rise or fall, standing proud or losing all
Die or live, destruction takes and freedom gives

He watches dark, he watches light
Two souls to proof, wrong or right
A constant fight, a war foretold
A settled plan, what future holdsPre
Chorus
Leadbreak Rolf

The final plan, the final fight
Casting out, dark or light
The lie will fall, truth will stand
The serpent dies by its own hand

Pre
Chorus
