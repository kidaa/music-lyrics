Atomic warheads, weapons of all kind
Invented to destroy, to find their victims, to grind
Mendacious rulers, ministers of defence
Leading you to war, can't you see where it all ends

Total destruction, adversary's death
Contamination, epidemics, and fear
Bloodshed goes on till the very last breath
No remedy if blood feeds the gear
Fight the oppression, now
Fight the oppression, downMegalomania, ruler's disease
Deceit and treason, your life is what they seize
All liberty is dying, to reign is the sense
Leading you to war, can't you see where it all ends

Total destruction, adversary's death
Contamination, epidemics, and fear
Bloodshed goes on till the very last breath
No remedy if blood feeds the gear
Fight the oppression, now
Fight the oppression, down
