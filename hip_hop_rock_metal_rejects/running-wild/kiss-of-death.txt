Hey Mr. Man in black, no more disguise
It's just a waste of time, we see through your lies

You think you've ruled the world, through the endless time
But on your wealthless soul, I wouldn't bet a dime

When the elder drops his arm you're dead and lost
He takes away your breath with the kiss of death

No deal can save your soul, we know your evil name
We see your cloven hoof, we know your evil game

When the elder drops his arm you're dead and lost
He takes away your breath with the kiss of death

You've really passed the point, the point of no return
When your evil soul will melt, the good at heart will yearn

When the elder drops his arm you're dead and lost
He takes away your breath with the kiss of death
