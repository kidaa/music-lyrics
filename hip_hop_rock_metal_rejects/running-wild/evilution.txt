Music: Kasparek/Becker
Lyrics: Finlay

Cries - for one lost nation reaching out against the wall
Lies - to a generation feeding minds that would not fall

Danger for the free
As they reach for the sky
I should be laughing now
But it's death in disguise

Pain - that sees no borders
- empty lives alone to feel
Insane - but who's to help us
- evil from the boot of steel

Doesn't hurt to flee
Pride when you die
Should I be crying now
Their deeds are full of lies
