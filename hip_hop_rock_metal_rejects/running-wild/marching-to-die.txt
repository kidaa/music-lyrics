Rabid war dogs are marching
Through the empty streets
Killing, laying waste
And spreading their leader's seed
Seduced by his lies and slanders
Which are pounding in their brain
The malediction of being used
To realize his magic aim

Marching to die
On their lips the battle cry
Marching to die
They don't ask the reasons why
Marching to dieGroundless they start a holocaust
The whole world through
They heel jews, turks and gypsies
And maybe you too
Fight against those new leaders
Prevent this dreadful war
We don't want this holocaust
So choke every spor

Marching to die
On their lips the battle cry
Marching to die
They don't ask the reasons why
Marching to die
