Nuclear tests that reap up wealth for the rich
They're selling their souls like a rotten sleazy bitch
Contaminated children are born to live in pain
No common sense if avarice rules the game

Atomic power is a dangerous and useless toy
Telling people, it's harmless is a cunning ploy
Allegiance is their ally so they do as they please
They are firm in their saddle no critics there to tease

Watch out there gonna blast you
Their bombs are made to kill
Contracts made for profit
Until they've got their fill

Dancing on a minefield
After the blast then you're dying fast
Dancing on a minefield
Poisoning life and no one will survivePoliticians get their share when they cheat and lie
The atomic lobby gets rich when the children die
Setting the world on fire like playing a game
Like an insane arsonist who's lighting the flame

Watch out there gonna blast you
Their bombs are made to kill
Contracts made for profit
Until they've got their fill

Dancing on a minefield
After the blast then you're dying fast
Dancing on a minefield
Poisoning life and no one will survive
