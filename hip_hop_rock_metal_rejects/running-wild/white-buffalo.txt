Acid rain and poison cauterize its skin
A boiling hell we're living in
Bloodstained animals, chainsaw rip the trees
The gasping earth is on its knees

Choking breath, causing death
Exploitation is your law
Overkill, break its will
You loot it hard and raw

Like you killed the white buffalo
You kill ozone, you break its bones
Like you killed the white buffalo
You tan its hide, sell its meat on the side

Once a source of glory, now a reborn hell
Your ivory tower is where you dwell
Gulping its vital lifeblood, pollution's rising high
You squeeze it out, you leave it dryChoking breath, causing death
Exploitation is your law
Overkill, break its will
You loot it hard and raw

Like you killed the white buffalo
You kill ozone, you break its bones
Like you killed the white buffalo
You tan its hide, sell its meat on the side

Headless, spraying poison
Contaminating air and ground
A misplaced sense of progress
Will destroy the pound for pound
Allergies and cancer, the pay for evil greed
Madness and corruption have shown their evil seed
