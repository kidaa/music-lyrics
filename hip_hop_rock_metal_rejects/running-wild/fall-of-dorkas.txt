Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Creation of the guardian, the force of dark and light
Two souls to rule the elements to fight a constant fight
One soul to save the light, one soul to serve the dark
Rivals to eternity, the saviour and the shark

The gods will fight, the titans clash in time and galaxies
The serpent and its tamer a fight so endlessly
Falling, fate is calling, the liar, tamed in fire

The fall of Dorkas, the curse of selfish pride
Reign of darkness, condemned to fear the light
Heart of blackness caught in eternal hate
Armageddon fullfills the longawaited fate

Dorkas as the chancellor, a charlatan surpreme
A godforsaken liar, intrigue, sly and mean
He made his bid for power, dropping down his mask
The uncrowned king of failures, Walloron kicked his ass

Pre
Chorus
Leadbreak Rolf

3.7 billion years, Armageddon's here
Madness shakes the underworld, they are lost in fear
The fire of catastrophy opens up the gate
Evil souls will drown in hell and Dorkas' soul will fade
