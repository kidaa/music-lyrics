Enchanted times, the decade of falling
But no one thinks of catastrophe
Seductive voice of death is calling
The fall of man is just plain to see
The mighty reign of devastation
Is raging wild alltrough the land
Sowing the winds of desperation
A deadly breeze by the Serpents hand

Darkest night, pride and hate
Raging force, the fate

Fire & Thunder, war & pain
Fire & Thunder, the devil's reign

The lost child is breathing badness
Building bombs just to serve his pride
Technological wings of madness
Could bring the end, eternal night

Darkest night, pride and hate
Raging force, the fateFire & Thunder, war & pain
Fire & Thunder, the devil's reign

The souls melt in the fire distress
The world's caught in a deadly trance
The flames of hell their reign is endless
No way out, no more second chance

Darkest night, pride and hate
Raging force, the wings of fate

Fire & Thunder, war & pain
Fire & Thunder, the devil's reign
Fire & Thunder, the final fight
Fire & Thunder, eternal night
