Riding the tempests of glory
The vessel is gliding along
Pounding the waves, majestically
Proudly and strong
A flag flutters on the horizon
The plunder ready-to-hand
The gunners are ready to fire
Awaiting command

Pounding the sea, like a storm
Wild and free
Obeying our call, fast and raw

The air sparks thunder and lightning
Their bellies are shivered with fear
We showered their cold hearted souls
With sarcastic sneer
Our cohorts are for seizing
The skull and the crossbones fly high
We're talking over your vessel
Whatever you try

Pounding the sea, like a storm
Wild and free
Obeying our call, fast and rawLead or gold, we're daring our fate
On the wings of the sea
Lead or gold, cursing all the
Conformists who'll never be free

Guns spitting iron and fire
Acid smoke clouding the air
Ripping the planks
Feeding the flame of despair
Hoisting the flag of surrender
Delivering their silver and gold
A generous gift to the poor
For the brothers they sold

Pounding the sea, like a storm
Wild and free
Obeying our call, fast and raw

Lead or gold, we're daring our fate
On the wings of the sea
Lead or gold, cursing all the
Conformists who'll never be free
