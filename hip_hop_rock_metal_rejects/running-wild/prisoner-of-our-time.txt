Paint in subways
Paint in busses
With your Edding big black pentagrams
Black metal graffitis are thrown against the wall
Crucifixes are inversed
Pictures are signed by the triple six
Black metal art is shocking law 'n' order man

Rockers of the underground
Black and heavy is our sound

Lost the money
Lost the job
Being catched by the cob
I am living not the role that you wanna give to me
Living life
My own way
Not tomorrow, but today
You are against me, but I tell you K.M.A.!!!Rockers of the underground
Black and heavy is our sound

We are prisoners of our time
But we are still alive
Fight for the freedom, Fight for the right
We are Running Wild
