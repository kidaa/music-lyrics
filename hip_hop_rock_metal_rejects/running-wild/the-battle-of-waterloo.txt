June the 18th 1815, the battle at "Belle-Alliance"
Marshy fields and pouring rain,
all the blood and a cannon's fire, cuirassier's attack,
British grenadiers stand tight
Wellington's command "Bluecher or the night",
but no Prussian in sight

The battle of Waterloo
a sea of blood that stains
The battle of Waterloo
lead and steel the bloody goods
The battle of Waterloo
they fight and die, fall one by one
The battle of Waterloo
a tribute to the bloody death

Fight, fight - you have to stand unite
Kill, kill - come on and have your thrill
Bleed, bleed - your blood flows on the field
Die, die - but nobody will ever cry for you

The french guard marches on and on
straight towards British lines
Bluecher's Prussians join the fight storming the fire side
The French guards fall one by one but Napoleon has gone
Do you know who's paying the costs ?
The little soldier, he's lost

The battle of Waterloo
a sea of blood that stains
The battle of Waterloo
lead and steel the bloody goods
The battle of Waterloo
they fight and die, fall one by one
The battle of Waterloo
a tribute to the bloody death
