See the danger of armament
Each single minute can be your last
World is full of killing machines
And they want to take your life
See the cruel warpigs, they suppress you
And they treat you like a slave
But there is someone, a fallen angel
And he teaches us to say "No!"

How long do you want to be the victim
Of state's power and force?
Stand up and struggle for freedom
And be Lucifer's friendSee the horror faces of mankind
And the blood running down the streets
And if you are dead or alive
They will never give a damn
See the lying popes and politicians
Giving reasons for this jinx
But there is someone, a fallen angel
And he teaches us to say "No!"

How long do you want to be the victim
Of state's power and force?
Stand up and struggle for freedom
And be Lucifer's friend
