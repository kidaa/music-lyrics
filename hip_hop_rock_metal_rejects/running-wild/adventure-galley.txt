Addicted to the stormy sea, the sound of clashing waves
Proudly they are rushing by on their breathless chase
Hunting for Long Ben and Tew, to bind them down in chains
They're standing every raging storm, the privation and the pain

They capture every sailing-ship, they're cashing in by stealth
Reprisal is the magic word to increase their heaped up wealth

They stand to stormy waters, the raging wild winds on the sea
No walking ghost or nightmare, could ever force them to their knees

Adventure Galley, proudly she's staying her course
Adventure Galley, the magical force, wild and free!

Addicted to the stromy sea, the sound of clashing waves
Proudly they are rushing by on their breathless chase

They stand no stormy waters, the raging wild winds on the sea
No walking ghost or nightmare, could ever force them to their knees

Adveture Galley, proudly she's staying her course
Adveture Galley, the magical force, wild and free!
