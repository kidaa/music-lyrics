Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Leadbreak Thilo

Black hole's opened in a whirl of time
Galaxy riders, longawaited sign

Defending watchers of the glorious stars
Freeing the worlds from the gods of Mars

Watching
RulingTimeriders, ruling the stars
Nightgliders, fighting back the gods of Mars

Leadbreak Thilo
Twinsolo Rolf

Erasing the evil without any sound
Burning their lair down to the ground
