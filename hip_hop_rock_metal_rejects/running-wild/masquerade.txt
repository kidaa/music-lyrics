Masked souls and blackest minds, mandrakes of the dark
Pitch and poison in their veins, they wear the evil's mark
Corruption, hate and deepest scorn they teach
"Obey and work!"the holy law they preach

They've sold your soul, your flesh and blood to the whims of evilgods
They've changed the world to hell on earth to save their evilplots
With murder, war and treachery they rule
If you trust in their machinery you're a fool

Masquerade, hiding their black-heart
Masquerade, evil and dark
Masquerade, treason and lies
Masquerade, covers their evil eyes

They rule the world by telling lies,
dripping poison in your ear
Keeping up appearances, revelation is their fear
They control your mind with hate and evil lies
Religion is the devil in disguise

Masquerade, hiding their black-heart
Masquerade, evil and dark
Masquerade, treason and lies
Masquerade, covers their evil eyes

So open up your clouded eyes the conspiracy to see
If you wipe away their evil world,
there's a chance of livingfree
The acient tales tell holy laws: The truth!
So be aware of what they are and they'll lose

Masquerade, hiding their black-heart
Masquerade, evil and dark
Masquerade, treason and lies
Masquerade, covers their evil eyes
Masquerade, hiding their black-heart
Masquerade, evil and dark
Masquerade, treason and lies
Masquerade, covers their evil eyes
