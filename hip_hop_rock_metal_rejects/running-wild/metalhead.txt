There's power in your blood, there's thunder in your veins
Staunchness is the way to keep you away from pain
If your everlasting soul is shedding of its fear
You'll be a rebel at heart, a stone in their gear

Fear and pain, Hades' name
Sin and pride their evil guide

Metalhead, trust in yourself and fight
Metalhead, free your mind
Metalhead, deny the darkened side
Metalhead, your soul is prime

They try to break your back, they wanna take away your pride
Fatheads are what they need, they wanna take you for a ride
Backbiters're telling lies to bring you into line
They try to ban the truth cause power and money's prime

Fear and pain, Hades' name
Sin and pride their evil guide

Metalhead, trust in yourself and fight
Metalhead, free your mind
Metalhead, deny the darkened side
Metalhead, your soul is prime

They fear the ancient symbols, true evil always will
Now afcending's rising, the fate will be fullfilled
Banning of saviour from evil, the holy pentagram
They know exactly who they are, blackest minds and men

Fear and pain, Hades' name
Sin and pride their evil guide

Metalhead, trust in yourself and fight
Metalhead, free your mind
Metalhead, deny the darkened side
Metalhead, your soul is prime

Metalhead, trust in yourself and fight
Metalhead, free your mind
Metalhead, deny the darkened side
Metalhead, your soul is prime
