Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Now! The age of falling
The final hours of the world we see
Here! Fate is calling
The horror of a longtold prophecy

Time! Is running short now
To find out if mankind's fit to learn
Down! Soul-destruction
If pride is blindand stuns the will to turn

The final hours, the final night
The final trial if you'll stand the light

When time runs out
When the sky comes down
When the ball will burst
When it shakes the ground down to the coreWar! The bombs are falling
Brother kills thy brother endlessly
Death! Massive destruction
A mess of blood that stains the boiling sea

Pre
Chorus
Leadbreak Rolf

Trapped! A poisoned world view
That is so blind that it will never make you see
Feel! Trust in yourself
And universal truth will hit you finally

Pre
Chorus
