Up with the roger, the vessel is close
Cannons are losded the weapons prepared
Set up more sails the distande grows
They try to escape but we shan't care

Calico Jack Listen and hear my command
Calico Jack I lead you to victory
Calico Jack We shall win in the end
Calico Jack You maybelieve what I foresee

Down with the roger, the vessel's too far
It's time for the flag, no remrse
Anne and Mary, more rum in my jar
I need more refreshment before we set course

Changing the course now, we must fet in touch
Triple afford, he must not escape
Our breath in their neck they feel our grudge
We have to hurry to get them in scrape

Fight

Acrid smell of smoke in the air
While flag's rising, mainmast breaks
Ears go deaf by my brother's blare
Upper deck is taken over

All of sudden a yelling cry
Ports turn open, what a mess
Soldiers get out 'n'comrades die
Desperate fights, we're on the loose

THE JUDGE

John Rackham
You are charged with murder and piracy of the high seas
In the name of Her Majesty you will be taken from this court
And hung, drawn and quartered

What are your last words, accused?

CALICO JACK

My last words? Ha ha!!!
Who do you think you are?!
What right have you to judge over my destiny?!
Take your pompous words and stick'em where the sundon't shine
I swear we meet again
Bye
