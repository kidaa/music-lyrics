Spineless and false you are creeping through time
Your flag's turning with the wind, your advantage is prime
Feathering your neat is your one and only law
Treachery and fraud is the sense that you are living for

Living on a lie, a mind-killing spell
You'll never ever learn cause you're living in your self-made hell

You're soulless, when the fire of evil burns in your heart
You're soulless, cause hate and greed's gonna tear you apart

The sledgehammer method is the way in which you act
You double-cross and cheat, you never show respect
Spiderlike you crawl, you spin your web of lies
Eternally you'll lose, cause truth will rule the dice

Living on a lie, a mind-killing spell
You'll never ever learn cause you're living in your self-made hell

You're soulless, when the fire of evil burns in your heart
You're soulless, cause hate and greed's gonna tear you apart

Conceited and dense, imposture is your call
Selfdestructed clown, imbecility is your fall
Reality and truth cut you down to size
Duck your rotten head, be prepared to pay the price

Living on a lie, a mind-killing spell
You'll never ever learn cause you're living in your self-made hell

You're soulless, when the fire of evil burns in your heart
You're soulless, cause hate and greed's gonna tear you apart
You're soulless, when the fire of evil burns in your heart
You're soulless, cause hate and greed's gonna tear you apart
You're soulless
You're soulless, heart of stone
You're soulless
You're soulless, bad to the bone
