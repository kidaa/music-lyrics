Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Did you ever see shoes are lying in the streets?
Brand new clothing, a pilgrim with no deeds? No way!

Did you ever think, who would throw it away?
A case of confusion? Madness on its way?

Silence, dead of the night
Killers, lurking behind

Darkness falls, the serpent strikes
A secret calls in the mask of the nightWhy should it happen a hundred times a year?
A secret behind that should rouse our fear?

Pre
Chorus
Leadbreak Rolf

Millions of people disappearing year by year
Leaving no trace or did they just go out of here?
Long told stories tell a blackened man awaits
Minotaurs meal, through bones and blood he wades

Pre
Chorus
