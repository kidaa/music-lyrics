The sky's swirling black
And choking fog blots out the sun
The last echo is silenced
New dark age has begun

The count-down was final
Red button ran out of control
No deposits required
Paradise won't take your soul

A living hell
For the stumbling few
Paying the price
For the likes of you

The once green earth
Is scattered with horror and gray
No winners, just losers
Who die with a few month's delayThe count-down was final
Red button ran out of control
No deposits required
Paradise won't take your soul

A living hell
For the stumbling few
Paying the price
For the likes of you

Man's not immortal
Despite killers bunkered so deep
A voice in the darkness
Warned against blind folded leap

A living hell
For the stumbling few
Paying the price
For the likes of you.
