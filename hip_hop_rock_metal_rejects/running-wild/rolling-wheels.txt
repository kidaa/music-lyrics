Vinyl hot from the press
Trucker's standing by
Ready to hit the road again
Distance's drive you insane

Roars of anticipation
The lights are going down
Time to up and go
To another crazy town

Still asleep 10am
Halls show signs of life
Roadies setting up the firey scene
Living, with a sound check in between

Roars of anticipation
The lights are going down
Time to up and go
To another crazy town

Counted on you kid
To show up tonight
In this together
To give the censors a fight

Lights are hot and blinding
Sound is crystal clear
Smoke and fire billow all around
Dragging the mood up from the groundRoars of anticipation
The lights are going down
Time to up and go
To another crazy town

Counted on you kid
To show up tonight
In this together
To give the censors a fight

Triumphant fists punch the air
Picks for eager hands
Backstage talk of travel's and deals
Living our lives on rolling wheels

Roars of anticipation
The lights are going down
Time to up and go
To another crazy town

Counted on you kid
To show up tonight
In this together
To give the censors a fight
