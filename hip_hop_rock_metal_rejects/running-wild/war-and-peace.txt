Rolf Kasparek
The rifles are firing, the cracking of guns break the still
The march of the soldiers, no mercy, no thoughts and no will

They fall one by one, their blood is shed without sense
Trapped in the spell of a nightmare

War & peace, you're walking just straight on the edge
War & peace, you're dying in war, but you even can't live in peace

You gun down your victim and the devil is laughing in scorn
You're killing your brother, cause he's wearing the wrong uniform

They fall one by one, their blood is shed without sense
Trapped in the spell of a nightmare

War & peace, you're walking just straight on the edge
War & peace, you're dying in war, but you even can't live in peace

The essence of all evil is living on madness and hate
So see and take over, to rule the key to your fate

They fall one by one, their blood is shed without sense
Trapped in the spell of a nightmare

War & peace, you're walking just straight on the edge
War & peace, you're dying in war, but you even can't live in peace

Inspired by the novel "War & Peace" by Leo Tolstoi
