Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Here comes the finale, time to pay your dues
A law without mercy, you have to take the truth
No worldly powers could force the fate
Universal judgement of the highest grade

Time's right to find out if you're wrong or right
Time is running short now, beware the law will strike
Evil souls are fading in the flames
No more lies and no more games

Into the fire
Blackened hearts will burn
Into the fire
The flames of no return

Drop all your blindness and your soul could last
Being proud and headstrong means you'll dying fast
Drowning in the fires your sad and final price
Melting in the pyre to burn away your liesPre

The true and final judgement is about to come
They are judge and jury, they are all in one
Deviding good from evil, deviding truth from lie
A case of survival or a "Go to hell and die!"

Pre
Chorus
