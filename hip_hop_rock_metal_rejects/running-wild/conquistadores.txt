Exploring the seas to conquer new lands
Troops arrayed by the church
Sanctified and blessed they set out
Crusaders, gentiles' scourge

They fight, they kill, they rape
Under the banner of the 'holy' church
They hunt, they lie, they cheat, thry steal
Doing dirty deeds under churchbell's peal

Conquistadores -
- Hungry for gold, doing as the religious madman told
Conquistadores -
- Religion's knight, havoc and death caused by pridePearls of glass for ingets of gold
Violence, force and deceit
Taking the wealth or the Indian's life
Their way of feeding their greed

Heathen must turn to Christianity
It's like 'believe or die'
Arrogance and blindless, religion's force
Believers never ask the reason why
