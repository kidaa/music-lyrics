He was just a gentile man
It was his love to grind
He didn't know the fear
He never had to hide
He loved the glance of metal
And the smell of blood
The flame of badness burned inside him
That was the only thing he had got

Genghis KhanCan't you see it's all a lie
The time had it made
He was a man like you and me
His era was his fate
He freed his conquered land
From the ban of death
Freedom to the mongolenation
By fanning their wrath

Genghis Khan
