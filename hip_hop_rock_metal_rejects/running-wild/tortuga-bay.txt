Lyrics: Finlay/Kasparek

1. Verse
Man or boy - we'll fight all as one
Bending the rules - it's the call of the wild
Last resort - to be shot down in pains
Playing your very last card

Prechorus:
Hoist up the mainbrace and fasten the sails
Crowsnest is screaming for shore
Ready the rum that is stored in the hold
Bringing what we need and more

Chorus:
Where the streets have no name
Where the devil's in all men
If you knew what was a slain
Pay or flee in Tortuga Bay

2. Verse
Fight to death - games that men play
Flashing of steel and the clash of the sword
Last breath - the kill of the day
Proving what all men must fearPrechorus:
Hoist up the mainbrace and fasten the sails
Crowsnest is screaming for shore
Ready the rum that is stored in the hold
Bringing what we need and more

3. Verse
Live by stealth - cover your track
Enemies scuttled but who needs to see
No escape - knife in your back
Proving what all men must fear

Prechorus:
Hoist up the mainbrace and fasten the sails
Crowsnest is screaming for shore
Ready the rum that is bound up in bales
Bringing what we need and more

Chorus:
Where survival's the game
Where you fight for your freedom
If you knew what was a slain
Pay or flee in Tortuga Bay
