A blinding phenomenon lights up the darkened sky
You think of U.F.O.'s, saucers that rush by
Photographs are taken, the public is informed
You trust in veracity but they laugh at you with scorn

Beware of the men in black, they rule the poison of darkness
Beware of the men in black, the creeping snake that lies
Beware of the men in black, staying black for all eternity
Beware of the men in black, lackeys to the lord of flies

You don't let rule the lie where the truth should be the law
So pale and blackdressed men are knocking at your door
They use intimidation to bring you into line
They say it's better to shut up if you think your health is prime

Beware of the men in black, they rule the poison of darkness
Beware of the men in black, the creeping snake that lies
Beware of the men in black, staying black for all eternity
Beware of the men in black, lackeys to the lord of flies

Hey Mr. Blackheart do you think you can endure
'Cause your cover up of truth, your net of lies is poor
Once the time will come to break the hiding wall
The truth will bid difiance, in deepest hell you'll fall

Beware of the men in black, they rule the poison of darkness
Beware of the men in black, the creeping snake that lies
Beware of the men in black, staying black for all eternity
Beware of the men in black, lackeys to the lord of flies
