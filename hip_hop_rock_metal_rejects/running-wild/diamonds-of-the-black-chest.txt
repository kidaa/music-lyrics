Since then he heard about the chest
He's so wild he can't get no rest
A million diamonds blinding his eyes
Brighter than fire but colder than ice
Sweat on his brow, greed burns his mind
Hands like claws his teeth always grind
Soaked by sweat he wakes up and screams
"Oh, no, it was only a dream"

Diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds of the black chest

Years and years he sought that chest
He runs most every risk the man's obsessed
For too many years he's roamed all the lands
To feel the diamonds in his hands
He find the hallow spot, breaking its lock
He opens the gate which is carved of rock
Finding the chest he exults and screams
"Oh, yeah, it's no dream"Diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds of the black chest

He holds out his hands and he touches the chest
He breaks its seals, he disturbs its rest
Curious and slow he opens the lid
He stares over the edge, what he sees he can't grip
No diamonds but he sees own face
A possessed wreck with an empty gaze
Thrilled by madness he's dying in pain
"No dream, he's insane"

Diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds of the black chest
