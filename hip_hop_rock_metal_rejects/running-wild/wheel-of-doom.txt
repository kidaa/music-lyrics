Religious madness is made to rule,
fights the sceptic with hate
Blind believers, the credulous fool,
weak and delivered to fate
A slave to science, prejudice-view,
its constant dogma is law
Caught in dumbness, no mind, no clue,
ignorant down to the core

It's you, keeping the hand on the wheel
It's you, ruling the fate
It's you, keeping the power to change the world
Before it's too late

The wheel of doom, turning circles
The wheel of doom, your hand on the wheel
The wheel of doom, light or darkness
The wheel of doom, no lieing, no deal

They cheat and lie and lie and cheat,
stagnation is serving their aim
Materialists gonna feed their greed,
praising the evil's name
Blinded tools made to obey, no mind,
no thoughts, no repend
Deny the truth and you'll have to pay,
you ruin yourself at the end

It's you, keeping the hand on the wheel
It's you, ruling the fate
It's you, keeping the power to change the world
Before it's too lateThe wheel of doom, turning circles
The wheel of doom, your hand on the wheel
The wheel of doom, light or darkness
The wheel of doom, no lieing, no deal

Don't stuck on relics that block your way,
don't be a wheel in their gear
So free yourself or you'll have to pay,
open your eyes wipe away your fear

It's you, keeping the hand on the wheel
It's you, ruling the fate
It's you, keeping the power to change the world
Before it's too late

The wheel of doom, turning circles
The wheel of doom, your hand on the wheel
The wheel of doom, light or darkness
The wheel of doom, no lieing, no deal
