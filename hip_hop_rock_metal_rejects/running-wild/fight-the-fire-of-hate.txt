Souldead fools, their hands up high
Spreading terror, the innocent die
Throwing bombs, the intention to kill
Soulless slaves, no reasons, no will

The evil madman has taken his toll
Possessing their mind, owning their souls
Souls of hate, hell awaits
Trembled with fear while they're walking its gates

Braindead phrase, screamed out loud
Imbecility rules, no slip up, no doubt
Bloodstained hands, the money rules
Taking their share by seducing fools

The evil madman has taken his toll
Possessing their mind, owning their souls
Souls of hate, hell awaits
Trembled with fear while they're walking its gates

Fight, the fire of hate
Fight the evil before it's too late
Fight, that life-killing flame
Cause when the blood flows no words can ease the pain

Bewilderment when the children die
As time goes by, no thought, no cry
Right-wing parties, lighting the flame
The fire of evil is ruling their gameThe evil madman has taken his toll
Possessing their mind, owning their souls
Souls of hate, hell awaits
Trembled with fear while they're walking its gates

Fight, the fire of hate
Fight the evil before it's too late
Fight, that life-killing flame
Cause when the blood flows no words can ease the pain

Souldead fools, their hands up high
