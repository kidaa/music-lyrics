Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek
Mordant wall of smoke, barrels glow, shot their load
Gunfire takes your breath, balls of lead causing death
Thunderstorm breaks loose, the slaughter's son, life's on the loose
Sounding the attack, soldiers fall, back to back

The roaring horde is near, pounding hooves, mortal fear
The soldiers bravely stand, they try hard to defend

Till the end!

Riding the attack
Yelling screams of the fallen
Thunder, blood and pain
Madness reigns, hell is calling now

Thunder shakes the ground, a deadly force, pound by pound
Frightened, nerves are blank, horseman ride, hit the flank
Cold sweat down their neck, death will ride one last attack
Fearsome battle cry, flashing guns, soldiers die

Tell me why!

Chorus
Leadbreak Rolf

Horror, death and pain, the devil smiles, so what's the gain?
Stretching out his claw to feed his laughing greedy jaw

Greedy jaw!

Chorus
