Thundering cannon fire is roaring
through the air
They're fighting courageous, driven by despair
Deadly muzzle flash robs them of their pride
Grapuels claw the rail, vessels side by side

Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity

Brutes are taking over
To claim their living spoils
Cracking musketfire until every plank is soiled
Surrender's, the only way
to stop this deadly raid
Bloody, fettered wrists, slavery's their fateSlavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity

Slave trade still exists, it's a legacy of the past
Punishment's long overdue
To fight the fears it casts
Hard - boiled criminals,
they're rotten to the core
Machinery in motion
so long as money is the law

Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
