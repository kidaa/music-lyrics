In 1987 they build a new machine
To conquer our future, to face things never seen
Curious of new weapons with more power to destroy
Ready for the wars with their exciting dangerous toy

Flickering lights in the dark indicating ignition
Energy runs through the circuits to start the transmission

Land of ice

In 1999 they find their destination
But reality on the screens destroys their fascination
Ruins and debris neither life nor the spore
A desert of ice with all the signs of nuclear war

Only the wind is breaking the threatening silence
Sensors show no human beings are living here now

But there are shadows moving around the vessel more and more
Disfigured creatures gathering, scratching claws on the door
The choir of the damned built of thousands of rough throats
"You are the humans of the past, who blasted our hopes"

May you come to see desolate world you created
Now you can take back a message to spread in your time
Tell'em what happens if they will continue this madness
Stop building bombs which are able to change the world
Into the land of ice
