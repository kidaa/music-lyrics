Lyrics: Finlay

Living fast - you take it day by day
One last chance - to throw it all away
Mistrust is all you see in a world of hate
You know the reason why - but way too late

In this heart he knows that he won't fall but
On the streets they're playing winner takes it all

One on one he's a renegade
Could tell his time was coming
Chasing the ace of life
One by one he will win again
Make no mistake this time
He's a renegadeRestless night, you wanna watch the dragon burn
Lives for knives, are you ever gonna learn
You really wanna know if the needle ever lies
But you just don't believe - it's the devil in disguise

In his heart he knows that he won't fall but
On the streets they're playing winner takes it all

One on one he's a renegade
Could tell his time was coming
Chasing the ace of life
One by one he will win again
Make no mistake this time
He's a renegade

Slowbit:
Severe vene puncture sights on the
inner forearm with evidence of vein
thrombosis on both right and left sides.
Rhinitus of the nasal passages with
evidence of extreme laceration of inner
membrane and mucus ducts.
Symptoms of withdrawal obvious together
with complaints of visual hallucinations
and extreme paranoia.
