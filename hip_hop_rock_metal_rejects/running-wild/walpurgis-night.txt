The streets are empty, all men are hidden home
I wonder why, what's going on here?
Someone shouts "stop boy" don't move on that way.
Tonight they're hunting for someone, for someone just like you.

I see fire, fire in the night
Symbols are burning so bright
It's the sign, the sign of women's fight
All men are so frightened

Thousand wild witches are srceaming through the night
They are thrilling with their magic, tragic is the daughter's fight
Pointing at me with their fingers, saying "you are the sin"
"Let's take him to our mountain to purify his soul"

I see fire, fire in the night
Symbols are burning so bright
It's the sign, the sign of women's fight
All men are so frightened

They bind me to a pole, naked they are beating with whips
They torture to inquire, hate is on their lips
Suddenly, the queen of the witches shouts "he is mine"
Naked she comes to violate me, there is no harder love in town

I see fire, fire in the night
Symbols are burning so bright
It's the sign, the sign of women's fight
All men are so frightened
