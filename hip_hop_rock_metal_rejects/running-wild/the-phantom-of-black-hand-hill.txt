Moonbeams touch the soil, streak of fog surrounds the scene
The eerie wind is howling, a lantern light's the only gleam
The one-eyed owl is calling, hands hold tight the iron-lamp
The cold is paralyzing, ponderous steps trough misty damp

The atmosphere's tremendous, seasoned men are choked with fear
The presence of the phantom, a strange and sublime power's near
The figures bathed in moonlight, a black dressed shape without a face
Celestial phenomenon and he disappeared without a trace

The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", moonlight ride, frightening thrill,
The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", honoured ghost, righteous will

Footsteps on the clearing, no one dares to speak or move
They returned to kill the phantom, but no one's got the balls to prove
Balls of light are flashing, an ancient tongue speaks words of truth
The fight of Armaggeddon?, good or evil who will lose?

The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", moonlight ride, frightening thrill,
The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", honoured ghost, righteous will

The spot of stakes of haunted, predestined when he was burned
For the righteous curse of vengeance, his good and honoured soul returned
"Black Hand Hill"'s a mystery, the spot is veiled in secrecy
Revealing ancient wisdom, but blinded eyes will never see

The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", moonlight ride, frightening thrill,
The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", honoured ghost, righteous will
The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", prophecy, ancient skill
The phantom of "Black Hand Hill", seasoned soul, breaks the still
