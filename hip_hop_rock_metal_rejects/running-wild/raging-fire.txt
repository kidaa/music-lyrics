Can you see the licking flame
Waiting for its time
Its increasing energy
Preparing for the prime

Fed up with your boring prate
All senses gettin lost
Second to none our flame shall rouse
Just like a growing host

Raging Fire burning down the walls
Raging Fire the rebellion force
Raging Fire all across the lands
Raging Fire fights in self defenseThe anger grows on and on
The young stand up and fight
No more lies and censorship
All oppressed stand tight

Raging Fire burning down the walls
Raging Fire the rebellion force
Raging Fire all across the lands
Raging Fire fights in self defense

Wake up break the silence
Come on join our league
We must stand defiant
To dethrone this breed
