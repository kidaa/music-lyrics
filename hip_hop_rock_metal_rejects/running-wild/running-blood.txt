Lyrics: Kasparek

The holy sword of fire is burning through the lands
Wisards and witches - their torture never ends
Religious madness creates this hell on earth
The "Holy" inquisition is spreading its curse

Murder, lies and slanders, 'cause they want to rule
Madmen and fools, they left a sea of running blood

Hundreds of pyres are burning in the night
Caluminated victims of "inquisition's" strike
Pray for the tortured, tears for their pain
Misanthropic blindness, a dog without a chain
Murder, lies and slanders, 'cause they want to rule
Madmen and fools, they left a sea of running blood
