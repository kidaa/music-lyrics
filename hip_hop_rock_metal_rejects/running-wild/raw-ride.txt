Racing through the night
Pounding engine's roar
There's nothing that's like this
I'm burning to the core
Exhaust hangs in the air
Wind pressure thrusts my face
I love to ride and dare
Tonight I'm being chased

Riding hard, riding fast
Full speed ahead, hear my engine's blast
Spinning wheels roll down the road
I'm a bundle of power, see my rims glow
Raw ride

On burning wheels tonight

Shooting through the dark
Taking bend after bend
Pistons are pumping hard
I'm gonna ride to the end
Twilight's coming slow
Like a jackal on attack
But I know I have to go
To go on and show my backRiding hard, riding fast
Full speed ahead, hear my engine's blast
Spinning wheels roll down the road
I'm a bundle of power, see my rims glow
Raw ride

On burning wheels tonight

I have to break free, to live on my own way tonight
I don't give a goddamn, what you want to force upon me
Fuck you !!!
