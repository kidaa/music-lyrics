As the day has gone and the heat has come
Head banger's war tonight
Screaming metal unleashed for the battle
Makes them feel alright
Sweat and beer, devilish cheer
Glaring flashlights
Chains and leather will live forever
The band begins its fight

We are right praying metal tonight
The message from hell and its spell
Even Satan wears leather, our souls to it forever
So let us pray our rules tonight

Chains & leather
Chains & leather
Chains & leather and rivets
Chains & leather
Chains & leather
Chains & leather foreverAll hell breaks loose and you have to choose
If you stay or go
Heaps are banging, chains are glanging
From the first to the last row
Praying their rules, having their booze
Thunder and aggression
Stunning the crowd, devilish loud
Our possession

We are right praying metal tonight
The message from hell and its spell
Even Satan wears leather, our souls to it forever
So let us pray our rules tonight

Chains & leather
Chains & leather
Chains & leather and rivets
Chains & leather
Chains & leather
Chains & leather forever
