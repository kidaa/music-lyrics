Darkness taking place of heat and light
Fear and coldness fill the air
Silent shadows slitting through the night
And another frozen body hits the earth

When madness rules and money talks
Beings better than these cursed as tainted dogs

Fight
When your caught between the lines
No back and forth, no left or right
No holy ghost will save your life
Only tough men stand the fight
The hope for justice on your mind
Won't change the world
Don't waste your time

Scraping substinence from piled debris
His presence rubs against the grain
In shame avoids the hand of charity
Until the hunger drives him mad again

This life just seems to be a war
The devils enemy and a victim of the law

Fight
When your caught between the lines
No back and forth, no left or right
No holy ghost will save your life
Only tough men stand the fight
The hope for justice on your mind
Won't change the world
Don't waste your timeWhen madness rules and money talks
Beings better than these cast as tainted dogs

Fight
When your caught between the lines
No back and forth, no left or right
No holy ghost will save your

Life
Only tough men stand the fight
The hope for justice on your mind
Won't change the world
Don't waste your

Time
When your caught between the lines
No time to run, no place to hide
When your life is just a lonely

Ride
Through the land of fire and ice
And all the dreams behind your eyes
Turned out to be a world of lies
