Strong and proud the cruise, black banner at the top
The spoondrift hits the bow, they round the reefs and rocks
The voice of freedom whispers in the rushing wind
They roam the raging sea on their gliding wings

They fight the black to save the truth
They fight the scorning lie
Oppressions wall they will destroy
They'll fight it till they die

Lions of the sea
They ride the wind eternally
They fight to be free
Roaming the seven seas of fate

They save their souls from black, from its evil void
Facing the challenge its coldness to destroy
They deny the temporal power, they deny their evil lies
They're strain at the leash until the evil dies

They fight the black to save the truth
They fight the scorning lie
Oppressions wall they will destroy
They'll fight it till they die

Lions of the sea
They ride the wind eternally
They fight to be free
Roaming the seven seas of fate

They brave the sea eternally, they tame the raging waves
Freedom is their destiny, the sea will be their grave

Strong and proud the cruise, black banner at the top
The spoondrift hits the bow, they round the reefs and rocks
The voice of freedom whispers in the rushing wind
They roam the raging sea on their gliding wings

They fight the black to save the truth
They fight the scorning lie
Oppressions wall they will destroy
They'll fight it till they die

Lions of the sea
They ride the wind eternally
They fight to be free
Roaming the seven seas of fate

Lions of the sea
They ride the wind eternally
They fight to be free
Roaming the seven seas of fate
