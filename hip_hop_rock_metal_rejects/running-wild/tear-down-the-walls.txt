Peculiar fragrance is all around
Ascent of tranquility, wonderful rest
Motions are slow, emotions are strong
Invisible nightmare's sitting on my chest

Feel so cool, light years away
Life's so cruel, can't stand a single day

Dangerous dreams of a distant world
Stupyfied senses, a slow way to die
Searching for shelter in clouds of smoke
Escape from reality, meanest lieFeel so cool, light years away
Life's so cruel, can't stand a single day
Tear down the walls

It appeared like a saviour to rescue my soul
Creeping fraud sneaked slightly into my life
It felt like a friend of very old days
It came on velvet paws, it was a hellbound drive

Feel so cool, light years away
Life's so cruel, can't stand a single day
Tear down the walls
