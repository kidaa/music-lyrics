You say I'm boisterous and evil
There's a demon in my eyes
You say I'm praying to the dark prince
The Lord of the Flies
Try hard to defame me, cos your power doesn't work on me
Your self-created blindness turns your heart to stone
Before it ever starts to feel

The youth is what I'm living
The wildness what I pray
I don't need no religion to lead me on my way
I don't need politicians to tell me wrong or right
Cos everything is transient and the treasury of life's
So rich and it waits for me

Like a wild animal, I follow my heart like it beats
Like a wild animal, the mighty urge to be free
To live the life I want
Like a wild animal, wildness leads my way
Like a wild animal, as long as I follow my nature
I'll never go astray.

Living, follow your heart on its way
Dying, deny your heart and you'll pay.

The church is praying moral
They say this piece of gum it kills
They build up funeral pyres
They burn people for their thrills.
They falsified the Bible, for the power and the gain
I never fawn on liars, the way they're gonna treat me
If they wanna stab my back
