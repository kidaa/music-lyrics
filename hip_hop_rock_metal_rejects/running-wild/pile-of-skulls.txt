Hey, Mr. Pope, Mr. Military Man
Kings and Queens
More evil that it seems
You lie, you cheat, you betray, you kill all the way
You wade through blood in your boots of steel
You hide the truth from its reveal
The world's bleeding wounds will never heal

So look in the mirror and see who you are
You made our lives an abbatoir
A man-eating machine that's what you are

Pile of skulls, conspiracy
Beware of the revealing key
No dance of joy, no harmless spree
No chance for you to hide or flee

Liar's tongue, tricks of deepest dye
Snake-skinned pack
You're evil and you're sly
Injust, you hunt, you hate, you take all the way
You're cutting throats with poisoned blades
Your recklessness overflows the graves
You try to make us all your slaves

So look in the mirror and see who you are
You made our lives an abbatoir
A man-eating machine that's what you arePile of skulls, conspiracy
Beware of the revealing key
No dance of joy, no harmless spree
No chance for you to hide or flee

Tears and pain, never ending shame
Bloodsucking lice
Play their evil game
Your doom is sealed, the truth revealed all the way
Headless you still run around
You can't believe you're losing ground
On your knees to take the count

So look in the mirror and see who you are
You made our lives an abbatoir
A man-eating machine that's what you are

Pile of skulls, conspiracy
Beware of the revealing key
No dance of joy, no harmless spree
No chance for you to hide or flee
