When they try to tell you knowledge is a dangerous thing
"It's such a dangerous thing"
The people that have it are the people that sin
And the people that need it are the people that can never win
"They can never win"
Let me get you out of here Little Broken Wing

There are people round here that are right
There are people round here that like to sleep at night
There are people round here that go slow
There are people round here that don't kindly to the killing of the
buffalo

When they tear up all the treaties and break up all the plans
"They break up all the plans"
Did you do your duty and kill on command?
Did you know the redman used to roam this land?
"He used to roam this land"
Now the souls of lost warriors blow across the sands

People round here they get it right
People round here we like to sleep at night
There are people round here that go slow
People round here that don't take kindly to the killing of the
buffalo, oh no

So listen to my story and listen to it well
"You better listen well"
Listen to the glory of the gory details of the tale I tell
Did you know the redman very well?
"I used to know him well"
Did you know the hunting ground before it became a hell?

There are people round here that are right
There are people round here that like to sleep at night
There are people round here I don't know
There are people round here that don't take kindly to the killing of
the buffalo

The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo

The killing
The killing of the
The killing of the buffal
The killing of the buffal
The killing of the buffal
The killing of the buffal
The killing of the buffal
The killing
The killing of the buffal

So listen to my story of Genocide
How they were hunted and slaughtered till there was no place left to
hide
Did you know the redman used to hold his head with pride?
Till every man, woman and child were destroyed

There are people round here that get it right
There are people round here that couldn't sleep at night
There are people round here I don't know
There are people round here that don't take kindly to the killing of
the buffalo

There are people round here that understand
There are people round here that couldn't give a damn
There are people round here that go slow
There are people round here that don't take too kindly to the killing
of the buffalo

The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing
The killing of the
They're killing all the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing
They're killing all the
They're killing all the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo
The killing
The killing of the
The killing of the buffalo
