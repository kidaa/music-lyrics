by L.Rutledge, W.Dane 
Steel eyes stare back at you
Held by his gaze he's healed you
Gripped by terror for now you see
The talisman shall hold the key 
The blind prophet shall breath fire
Fortelling dreams of past
And visions of your death
He lies shackled in the mire
And beckons to your cries
Dreaming of your death 
Corrupt eyes are filled with hate
Their greedy souls opened hell's gate
The crosses mirror his growing rage
They've breached the keep
He's fled his cage 
So I bring black plague unto you
Lightning congeals to kill you
Relentless screams call unto me
We are the soldiers of steel 
The blind jackal of remorse
Has chosen you as pawn
And seized your crippled mind
Blue eyes glowing slammed the door
And kill the silence we once knew
Deliverer of mankind 
Still I will seek the truth
The pious one can never rule
Prophetic visions are now shown clear
Upon the wall "I will be free" 
So I bring black plague unto you
Lightning congeals to kill you
Relentless screams call unto me
We are the soldiers of steel
