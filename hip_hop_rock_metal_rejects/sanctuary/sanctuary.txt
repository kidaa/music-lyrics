by L.Rutledge, W.Dane 
And by the moonlight flow visions born from darkness
The answers shall now be found
And by the moonlight
All will be revealed, wisdom of the ages falls like rain
I am of the future, take my fire
And release your flame 
And so I leave this world, never to return
My candle has been burned, for deliverence I yearn
Time cannot erase the mark I leave on time and space
Sanctuary burns, raging grace 
I will live on, pure energy and perfect knowledge
The eye of the storm, judgement now awaits for me
Am I born to darkness or to light? 
I'm flying to the sun, wings are stained with blood
My journey has begun, am I blessed or am I damned
Years will melt away
My mortal shell, left to decay
The Sanctuary learns your love and hate 
I will live on, pure energy and perfect knowledge
The eye of the storm, judgement now awaits for me
Am I born to darkness or to light? 
Enter the Sanctuary 
And so I leave this world, never to return
I am the new lifeform, I have seen and you will learn
Time cannot erase, my passage through this sacred place
The Sanctuary's hand, this is your fate.
