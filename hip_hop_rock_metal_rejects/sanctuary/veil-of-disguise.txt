I've passed into the afterworld
To a place where light can't intrude
I bear this curse transcending time
My pain denies my your truths 
Dreaming to be free, yet damned to eternity
Dreams can set me free for awhile
Changed to this burning, yet only a child
My soul must feed, their blood has made me King 
Look deep in my eyes
And see the calm before the
Storm winds of the damned are unveiled
And so with your blood
I feed and quell my hunger
The boy Pharoah's curse is passed on 
Screans of dying, I am back from beyond
Mock my religion, by the power of the Gods I am strong 
Rebirth, through fire shall hold your fears at bay
See in my ancient eyes
Rip through my veil of disguise 
Prowl in the darkness, pierce your throat
And your lifeforce is drained
Now my disciple, I take you and make you my slave 
Rebirth, through fire shall hold your fears at bay
See in my ancient eyes
Rip through my veil of disguise
I have survived the centuries
Waiting for mankind's demise
Surrender to me, and no longer live in terror
Give into me, or live your life in fear 
I will dominate the likes of you
I will hunt you with the rising moon
Just one look from me and you are hypnotized
Frozen by the spell within my eyes
By the light, I'm ordained to reign 
As I see the sun rise on these ancient sands
My immortal gift lies dying in your hands
