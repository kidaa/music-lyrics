There's power here, we shall join and make a stand
Fear lives inside your mind and it whispers my command
Our leaders they tell us right and wrong
Rebellion is close at hand 
Who are you to say what's right
Spit in your face, we will uprise 
Violate, dominate, feel the force to terminate 
Who are you to take our lives 
Violate, dominate, feel the force to terminate 
And so it's done, chaos surrounds this world gone mad
I dream of peace and love
No turning back it's not in their plan
It's over before it began
It's over I've seen the end 
We will uprise, take my hand
Termination force will stand 
Violate, dominate, feel the force to terminate 
We will uprise, take my hand 
Violate, dominate, feel the force to terminate
