I was born a warrior, force of steel in my hands
We must fight to save our world
Spread this message through the land 
Seize control
We will fight to seize control
We will fight to seize control
And the time has come for man to change
And free this earth from coming plague 
Change is coming, my voice shall be heard
A new day dawning, hear my words 
I bring truth and understanding to your darkest fears
Ascension to your destiny is drawing near
Taste the wrath of my swift sword, legion of the night
Immortals come to rule to earth on beams of light 
Fight to seize control
We will fight to seize control, we will fight 
Change is coming, my voice shall be heard
A new day is dawning, hear my words 
I bring truth and understanding to your darkest fears
Ascension to your destiny is drawing near
Taste the wrath of my swift sword, legion of the night
Immortals come to rule the earth on beams of light 
See the world burning, is this a dream?
Warrior returning, his blood is steel 
Time has come for man to change
And free this earth from coming plague 
Change is coming, my voice shall be heard
