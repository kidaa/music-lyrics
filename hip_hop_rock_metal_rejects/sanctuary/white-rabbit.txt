Little Alice is on drugs again
They've bent her little mind 
One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall 
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice, when she was just small 
When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low 
Go ask Alice, I think she'll know
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
And the white knight is talking backward
The red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head, feed your head
