You're living in a lie
Your tears, repentance fills your eyes
Your life, is not what it seems to be
For you breed agony
Your tortured mind will cry out, take my soul 
Die for me, die for my sins for I've seen
My cold and bitter end 
Trapped illusions of your fate
Your end is only what you've made
Return, and taste reality again
Your sudden faith is all in vain
Your whithered voice is chanting I'm impure 
Die for me, die for my sins for I've seen
My cold and bitter end 
Standing at the altar, hands in prayer
Your crystal image shatters
Despair 
Suffering, no one can help you now
Betrayed by your worn and tattered vows 
You're living in a lie
Your tears, repentance fills your eyes
Your life stands for nothing but your shame
No one else will bear your blame
My mortal life of anguish I've endured 
Die for me, die for my sins for I've seen
My cold and bitter end
As you feel the lies hypocrisy chokes the life from you
Die for me, die only for me
