Staring into the sky, the red glare will blind your eyes
Afraid to see the light
Your fears have spread this plight
No way to kill the power
Behold our race will die 
Deathrider comes from above
No place to hide nowhere to run
Deathrider's rage is on the loose
Your neck and its eternal noose 
Our leaders have set the course, impending world war
Afraid of what's been lost
Your life the bitter cost
No prayer can stop the third war
Behold the holocaust 
Deathrider comes from above
No place to hide nowhere to run 
As the city burns I cannot hear your cries
Will our world end in 1999
A fifteenth century seer saw us cast
Into the black, death attacks 
Afraid to see the light
Your fears have spread this plight
No way to kill the power
Behold our race will die 
Deathrider comes from above
No place to hide nowhere to run
Deathrider's rage is on the loose
Your neck in its eternal noose
