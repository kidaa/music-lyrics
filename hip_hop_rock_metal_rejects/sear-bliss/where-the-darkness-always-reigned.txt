The pentagram is frozen, in your dark dreams
There are butchered christisn priests
Falling in the common grave
Blood of christ paints my face.

Disgraced godly thoughts,
Thousand believer's souls
A burning church brings me jyoy,
Many believers affection burns in there.

My dark spirit purified after an unholy blasphemy.
Frozen pentagram shines on the night of the massacre.
