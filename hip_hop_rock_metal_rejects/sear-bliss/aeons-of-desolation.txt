The wind sighed among the trees
The fallen leafs crackled
On the sleeping landscape

It was a sad, still voice
And I hear, only I hear it
The only human being in the night

Among the hungry shadows
Who are smelling the breeze
Which is carrying the secret dreams
Hidden desires
I hear as the wind brings it towards me

And from the impasse it always returns
I hear
Only I hear it
As the naked wind weeps through the night
