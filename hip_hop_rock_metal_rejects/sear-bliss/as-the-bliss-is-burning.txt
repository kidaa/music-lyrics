The night has fallen black
Whispering voices surrounding me
My being is the only eternal blaze
In the black mirror of shadows
I can't feel the pain
But struggle to a finish
I'm becoming

I hold the blaze in my hand
It makes my eyes blind
And a distant voice calls me
In the drawing of the secret
I can't feel pain
I'm becomingI broke through the silent darkness
Beyond the treshold a sear bliss was
Waiting for me
It whirled me along, I feel
It draws me deeper
I can't feel pain
I'm becoming
