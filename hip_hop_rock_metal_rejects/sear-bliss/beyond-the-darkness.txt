We walk on hidden ways
And live the worn moments of reality
There's no free soaring
The all-saving aim
There's no flotation just painful being and emptiness
But my soul wants to break free from its prison shaped body
For its long agonies to find the ways to dark secrets

Where we must fight great battles
We must walk through endless paths

Where with the help of warning masks of tiny gravels
We reach the last fulfillment to merge into darkness

And just he who doesn't want to see the bliss
He can't see the eyes in which the fire is still burning
