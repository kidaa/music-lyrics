The forest is dying
In the heat of the sun
The countryside is burning
Dying birds on dying trees
They sing their last song.

The sky turns dark, the sun
Falls apart.
Full moon shines.
The sky opens up
From the next world arrives Vata.

Icecold fire burning in his eyes
Awekening, from the other world
Into this real one.
Wolves licking my body, frozen in ice
Desire grows the desire of....It brings eternal winter
Onto the sizzling countryside.
The mourning is still painful
My soul frozen in ice.

ADRAMARAH calls me again
I stepped into his dream
Piercing coldness embraces me.
I feel the power of the next world
I feel the power of the Lord of emptyness.

Now I think back
A strange feeling, as I lie buried
In the frozen ground, I feel the coldness
Of hte sweeping winter storm
