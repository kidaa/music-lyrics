'Oh my lord, let us fire up every church
Oh my lord, let us break every bell
Oh my lord, let us kill every priest'
11th century saga, Hungary

Witches burn the twelve holy disciples
Christian believers frozen in blood
On the darkest infernal day
On the dawn of eternal funeral
The holy trinity burns on the stake
Faith of our heart, the only sign is immortal
