Awesome power
Emptiness
Loneliness
Spiritual journey
On the edge of the horizon.
The moon projects dream images.

Frozen mourning calls
On the eve of the pagan winterOn a November night
Dreamworld, in the frozen
Reflection of the sea.
Internal powers draw me in
Inside my own self.
Paralysed voices
In a virtual reality.

Frozen mourning calls
On the eve of the pagan winter
