Lola and Applegate:
Two lost souls on the highway of life, 
We ain't even got a sister or brother,
But ain't it just great,
Ain't it just grand? 
We've got each other!
Two lost ships on a stormy sea.
One with no sail and one with no rudder,
But ain't it just great, 
Ain't it just grand?
We've got each 'udder!'
Two lost sheep,
In the wilds of the hills,
Far from the other Jacks and Jills,
We wandered away
And went astray,
But we ain't fussin' 
'Cuz we've got 'us-'n'.
We're two lost souls on the highway of life
And there is no one with whom we would 'ruther'
Say, ain't it just great, 
Ain't it just grand? 
We've got each other!
Where-ever we go, whatever we do, 
As long as you've got me and I've got you; 
We've got a lot
Because we've got each other.
We ain't fussin' 'cause we got 'us'n'. 
Wherever we go
Whatever we do
As long as you've got me
And I've got you
We've got a lot
Because we got 
We got each other.
