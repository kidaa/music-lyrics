Joe:
Goodbye old girl,
My old girl,
When you awake, I'll be gone,
Can't tell you where I'll go.
It isn't fair, I know,
But trust in me and carry on.
Goodbye, old friend,
My old friend,
There's somethin' 
I must let you know,
I haven't said it much,
I guess I've lost my touch.
But my old girl
I love you so.
Now I know it hasn't all been rosy,
We've had squabbin' days when tears 
Were brought about
But In a moment or two 
We would bill and coo,
And never even knew what we fought about. 
...And now your Joe
Has to go
But he'll come back to you again
So sleep your sleep, old girl
Our love will keep, old girl
'Til then...
Joe Hardy:

Goodbye
