Hinkel / Freudenthaler

When blue ethereal winds arise
And stars begin to paint the skies
Then don't be scared
Just close your eyes

When veils of silence lay them down
And noone seems to be around
I'll be there for you, wait for you
the whole night through
Good night  I love you

Elfs and sprites, they'll be your side
To lead you straight to your heart
Don't be afraid of going into

I'll be there for you, wait for you
the whole night through
Good night  I love you
