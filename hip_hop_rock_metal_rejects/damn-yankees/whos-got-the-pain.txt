Someone must be sick with the heat,
Or steppin' on ev'ryone's feet.
But if ev'ryone's feelin' o.k.
Why don't they just say "o-lay,"
When the music carries them away
Ugh!
Who's got the pain when they do the mambo?
Who's got the pain when go "ugh"!
Who's got the pain when they do the mambo?
I don't know who!
Do you?
Who's got the pain
Who's got the pain
I don't know who!
Do you?
Henry and Lola:
Ugh!
Is there a doctor in the house?
Is there a doctor in the house?
If there's a doctor in the house,
Point him out.
For there is an element of doubt
