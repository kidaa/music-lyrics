Meg:
A woman doesn't 
Know what she
Has
Until she loses it.
When a woman has 
The love of a man 
She abuses it. 
I didn't know 
What I had
When I had my old
Love.
I didn't know
What I had
Till I said good-
Bye old love. 
Yes, a woman
Doesn't know
What she has 
'Til it is no longer
Around...
Meg and Joe:
But the happy thought is
Whatever it is he's lost 
May one day,
Once again
Be
Found!
