Lola:
I took the zing out the King of Siam!
I took the starch out of the sails
Of the Prince of Wales,
It's no great art,
Gettin' the heart of a man
On a silver platter.
A little brains, a little talent
With an emphasis on the latter!
I made mince-meat out of a sweet young farmer!
I knocked the fight out of a knight
When I pierced his armor.
And I'll bet,
I can upset ev'ry male
In a Yale regatta!
A little brains, a little talent
With an emphasis on the latter!
You gotta know just what to say
And how to say it,
You gotta know what game to play 
And how to play it.
You gotta stack those decks worth a couple o' extra aces,
And this queen has her aces
In all the right places!
I've done much more than that old bore Delilah!
I took the curl out of the hair 
Of a millionaire.
There is no trick 
Gettin some hick who is cool
Just a little warmer,
A little talent, a little brains
With an emphasis on the former!
Split up a home, way up in Nome, Alaska!
And wrecked the life of ev'ry wife
Down in Madagascar.
Ask me why weak men'll die for me,
Strong men simply shatter,
A little brains, a little talent
With an emphasis on the latter!
You've gotta know just what to do,
And know how to do it,
You've gotta know what tea to brew,
And how to brew it.
You've seen the sign that says George Washington 
Once slept here.
Well, tho' nobody spied him
Guess who was beside him?
Bring on that boy,
He'll be a toy
For Lola,
Just one more case,
She can erase
With that old Boffola;
What's my plan?
Same as with any man,
I'll use the standard patter
Plus a little this-a
And a little that-a
With an emphasis on the latter!
