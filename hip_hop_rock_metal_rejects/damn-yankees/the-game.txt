Sohovik:
We've got to think about the game!
All:
The game, the game!
Sohovik:
We've got to think about the game,
All:
The game, the game!
Sohovik:
Booze and broads may be great,
Smokey:
Tho' they're great they'll have to wait,
While we think about the game.
Sohovik:
There was that waitress back in Kansas City,
Built for comfort, dumb but pretty!
Bubba:
Yeah? 
Yeah?
Sohovik:
Man, her perfume sure did smell sweet,
Got her up to my hotel suite!
All:
Yeah?
Yeah? 
Sohovik:
She kills a pint of gin, more or less,
The lights were low and she slips off her dress!
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Sohovik:
But then I thought about the game!
All:
The game!
The game!
Sohovik:
Oh yes, I thought about the game!
All:
The game!
The game!
Sohovik:
I thought I got the lady high,
I just left her high and dry
'Cause I thought about the game!
Smokey:
Them was that Pullman car that I got lost in,
On a sleeper out of Boston!
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Smokey:
Compartment doors all look the same there,
Walk in one and there's this dame there!
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Smokey:
Blonde and stacked and absolutely bare,
And nothin' separatin' us but air
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Smokey:
But then I thought about the game!
All:
The game,
The game!
Smokey:
Oh yes, I thought about the game,
All:
The game,
The game!
Smokey:
Though my heart said "stay for tea,"
All I said was "pardon me!"
'Cause I thought about the game.
All:
He thought about the game.
Mickey:
When a chick gives you the eye
All:
Remember
Abstain!
Dell:
When you're dyin' for some rye,
Remember
All:
Remember
Refrain!
Rocky:
If you're losing at crap and the clock says it's eleven,
And suddenly, each roll you roll
Comes up a seven,
And you're in the kind of dive
Where men are men.
All:
Be Polite,
Say goodnight.
You should be in bed by ten.
Bubba:
When your mother bakes you cakes,
All:
Remember,
Stay thin!
Henry:
When you're kissin' till it aches,
All:
Remember
Don't give in!
Ev'ry rule we shall obey,
To be sure,
Cause to win we've got to stay
Good and pure, 
Good and pure.
Bomber:
Hey Oz, remember those twins we took a ride with 
Operatin' side by side with.
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Ozzie:
We're out of gas three miles from Philly.
The night is warm, the sky's a dilly.
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Bomber:
So I suggest we sleep beneath a tree,
With no one there but Oz,
The chicks and me.
All:
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
So there we are, lyin' side by side under the tree. 
Four minds with a single thought
I look at my girl
I look at mine...
And then with one...fell...swoop.
All:
But then they thought about the game!
The game, the game!
Oh yes, we thought about the game!
The game, the game!
To our women one and all,
We will see you in the fall,
But for now we've got to stall ev'ry dame!
And think about the game!
Think about the game,
Think about the, 
Think about the,
Think about the,
Think about the game.
