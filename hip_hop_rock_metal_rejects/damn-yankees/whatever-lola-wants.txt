Lola
Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets
And little man,
Little Lola wants you.
Make up your mind to have
No regrets;
Recline yourself, 
Resign yourself,
You're through
I always get
What I aim for
And your heart 'n' soul
Is what I came for
Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets
No use to fight,
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule.
I'm irresistible you fool.
Give in!
Give in!
Give in!

I always get
What I aim for
And your heart 'n' soul
Is what I came for.
Lola wants
Lola gets
You'll never win.
I'm irresistible you fool.
Give in!
Give in!
Give in!
