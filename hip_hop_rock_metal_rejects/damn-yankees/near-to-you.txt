Boyd:
He's near to you...
Near to you..
Though you think he's far away,
He's near to you...
So near to you...
As near as April is to May!
Hardy:
Can't you feel him there in his favorite chair...
Staring at the fire place
Oh so near to you...
Boyd:
...Always near to you
Both:
Why you might as well be face to face
Meg:
For it's just as though...
Hardy:
He was standing as close as I...
Meg:
I know it's hard to imagine....
Boyd:
But try...
All Three:
If he's really...
Both:
Near to you, near to you 
You may be far apart and yet
Hardy:
If he's in your heart
Boyd:
Really in your heart
Both:
How near to you can he get?
Trio:
For it's just as though...
He were standing as close as I...
Meg:
I know it's hard to imagine...
Both:
But try...
Both Men:
If he's really dear to you
Meg:
He's near to me
Both Men:
You may be far apart and yet
Meg:
If he's in my heart
Both Men:
Really in your heart
All Three:
