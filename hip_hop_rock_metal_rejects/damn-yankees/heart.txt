Van Buren:
You gotta have heart
All you really need is heart
When the odds are sayin'
You'll never win
That's when a grin
Should start.
You gotta have hope
Mustn't sit around and mope
Nothin's half as better as it may appear
Wait'll next year
And hope.
When your luck is battin' zero
Get your chin up off the floor.
Mister you can be a hero
You can open any door,
There's nothin' to it,
But to do it
You've gotta have heart
Miles 'n' miles 'n' miles of heart,
Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course,
But keep that old horse before the cart,
First you've gotta have heart.

We've got heart
All we really need is heart,
You gotta have heart
All you really need is heart
When the odds are sayin'
You'll never win
That's when the grin should start
We've got hope
We don't sit around and mope.
None is solitary sob do we heave,
Mister, cause we've got hope.

Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course,
But keep that old horse before the cart.
