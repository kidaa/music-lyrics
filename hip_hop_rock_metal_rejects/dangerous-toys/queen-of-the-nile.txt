with air
Golden waves in all directions, I could lose my soul right here
Colour lights on the runway makes a stranger feel unchained

I'm running after time   I miss the sunshine
Summer days will come, happiness will be mine
I'm lost in my words, I don't know where I'm going
I do the best I can not to worry about things

I feel loose, I feel haggard, don't know what I'm looking  for
Something true, something lovely that will make me feel alive

I'm  running after time and i miss the sunshine
Summer days will come, happiness will be mine
I'm lost in my words, I don't know where I'm going
I do the best i can not to worry about things

Like a vagabond in the distance looking for a song to sing
A song that will last all night and for the rest of our lives
I'm lost in my words, I don't know where I'm going
I do the best i can not to worry about things

I'm running after time and I miss the sunshine
Summer days will come, happiness will be mine
I'm lost in my words,I don't know where I'm going
I do the best i can not to worry about things

I'm running after time and i miss the sunshine
Summer days will come, happiness will be mine
