Sometimes I realise that the best will come if you work at it,
Sometimes I sympathise that it doesn't always happen when you begin it,
Yeah! We got a good thing going,
I'm gonna say I'd give it all up for you Yeah! Yeah!
Sometimes I see the light but only down the line, when it's night, Yeah!
Sometimes I put it right but only on the draw in sa gun fight.
Yeah! We got a good thing going,
I'm gonna say I'd give it all up for you Yeah! Yeah!
Chorus
I've got something to say Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm a lining today Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Which game do you play Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I can see it for myself.
Sometimes I see the light but only down the line, when it's night Yeah!
Sometimes I put it right but only on the draw in a gun fight.
Yeah! We got a good thing going,
I'm gonna say I'd give it all up for you Yeah! Yeah!
Chorus
Guitar solo
Yeah! We got a good thing going,
I'm gonna say I'd give it all up for you Yeah! Yeah!
