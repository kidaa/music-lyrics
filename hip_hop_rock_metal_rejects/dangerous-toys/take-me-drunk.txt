A creature made of sunshine her eyes were like the sky
Rabbit howls like something old as we twitch to her lullaby
The scalpel shines in gods sunshine street lights whisper pain
Down here near the poison stream our god has gone insane
She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands into the sun she stares
She feels it die, I hear her cry
Like the scream of the butterfly
Sunshine a house in flames
She likes it where she gets it but it's never felt the same
Surgery in the house of dissection
When your candle burns out I will resurrect you
She runs through fields of daisies
Yeah it's just a shame that they eat their own babies
Who cares cause the air is free
When you get there will you kiss the dead for me?
There's blood on the moon and the summer is cold
There's blood in the room but that's gettin' old
There's blood on my face sittin' on a dead shore
A highway of emptiness and I', gettin' bored
There's blood on the moon as we plan our escape
The goddess in bloom handcuffed and raped
There's blood in the bath tub murder the king
There's blood on the moon, there's blood on just about everything
Something cold is forced inside her a tear spills down her cheek
Stillborn songs of a dead dreamer, hymns of the needle freak
With sunlight in her hair she smiles like she don't care her dreams are
liquid blue
I cut myself again and again to remind myself of you
