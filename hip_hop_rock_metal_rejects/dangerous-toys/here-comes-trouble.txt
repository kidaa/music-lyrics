She counts the days away and waits for Valentines
She says every other day is just a waste of time, you know
She don't believe in miracles or make believe
If you were blind you still could see
That she believes in me
It feels like I found a pocket full of gold
I'm Lucky, baby, so Lucky, baby
Lucky to be with you today, Lucky to be the one to say
I'm Lucky, baby, so Lucky, baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
I'm lucky to be the one to be Lucky
Not all of heaven's angels get to wear their wings
She likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings, you know
But she brings sunshine to a cloudy day
When we walk on by people stop and say
I'm Lucky, baby, so Lucky, baby
Lucky to be with you today, Lucky to be the one to say
I'm Lucky, baby, so Lucky, baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
I'm lucky to be the one to be Lucky
I got lucky when you found me
It only took one kiss to see
What did I do to get to be...

Lucky, baby, so Lucky, baby
Lucky to be with you today, Lucky to be the one to say
I'm Lucky, baby, so Lucky, baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
I'm Lucky to be the one to be lucky
