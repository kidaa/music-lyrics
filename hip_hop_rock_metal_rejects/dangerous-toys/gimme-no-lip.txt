When the school lets out and the shifts are done
Get the boys together get a ball get a run
Lace up the sneaks kick off them shoes
I'll admit I play to win yo cause I don't like to lose
At Seger Park they've got the competition
Good moves baby -- I'm the definition
They shooting hoops
Yeah Yeah Yeah
They playing basketball
I learned at Old Pine, see I'm the school yard hustler
I had my hardknocks now I'm an off the backboard buster
I could fake to the left penetrate like Mike
Or 360 in the air as Dominique might
I could pass like Magic
I could shoot like the Bird, after a Doctor J dunk
The courtside drunk said good lord
They shooting hoops
Yeah Yeah Yeah
They playing basketball
Lunch from a hot dog stand a pretzel and a pop
We've been playing all day cuase we've had this court nonstop
The city sun is hot -- all the courts they steaming
Bright eyed young ball handlers are believing and dreaming
Hoping some day all this playing will be paying
That's what all the sideline junkies smoking reefer keep saying
They shooting hoops
Yeah Yeah Yeah
They playing basketball
