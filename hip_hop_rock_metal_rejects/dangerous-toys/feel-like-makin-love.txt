VERSE 1:
Baby you've got to believe in me like I believe in you
Turn around, look what you've got
When I've got you, I see in you, I know how deep you run,
And I love every piece of your mind and heart.
Friends turn when the wind blows, the wrong way,
But I am here for you always.

Chorus:
You've got me heart and soul
We will grow old together
Don't care how the world turns
I promised you forever.
To have and to hold
You've got me heart and soul.

VERSE 2:
Never met anyone who was perfect, and I never will.
Disillusion, promises, I've had my fill,
But much greater is the power to rise above
Any obstacles we're given because we have lots of love

CHORUS
