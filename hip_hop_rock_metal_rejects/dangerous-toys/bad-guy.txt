Help comes when you need it most
I'm cured for laughter
Mood swings not sure I can cope
My life's in plaster in plaster

May your mind set you free
chorus: opened by the wonderful
May your heart lead you on
May your mind let you breathe all of disaster
chorus: opened by the wonderful
May your heart lead you on

These wounds are all self-imposed
Life's no disaster, disaster
All roads lead unto death-row
Who knows what's after

May your mind be wide open
May your heart beat strong
May your mind's will be broken
By this heart-felt song

May your mind set you free Chorus: Be opened by the wonderful
May your heart lead you on
May your mind let you breathe all of disaster Chorus: Be opened by the
wonderful
May your heart lead you on, may your heart lead you on
May your eyes let you see all of disaster
May your heart lead you on, lead you on
Chorus: May your eyes be opened by the wonderful
Set you free Chorus: May your heart lead you on
Lead you on
