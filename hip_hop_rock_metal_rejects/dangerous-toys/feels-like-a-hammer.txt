See the fleet of cruising cars
go past the stations and the bars.
Never stop to get out
in case they choose to cruise about.
Well, I tell you, that boy,
he stopped up at the station.
He must be on a mission of passion
Couldn't make out whether he was from
Salford or...ah... Manchester.
And this London visitor had this to say:
Cheater
Cheetham Hill.
Only way you stop is for passion at the station.
Why you cruising? To be unfaithful.
You want to settle up, you want to settle down.
And some man really hurt you.
He isn't around in Cheetham.
You cheated.
Well I tell you,
That boy, he stopped up at the station.
He must be on a mission of passion.
Cheater.
Cheetham Hill.
Where you going, boy? Are you cheatin'?
Is that why you come from Cheetham Hill?
When you stopped up at the station
was it an excuse to get away from your wife?
Couldn't make out whether he was from
Salford or...ah...Manchester
And this London visitor had this to say
Cheater
Cheetham.
Cheetham Hill.
