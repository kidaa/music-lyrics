a summer's day in sixty-eight
sunlight through a window falls across the page
a young boy tries to concentrate
his mind would rather fly beyond the classroom cage
he can take the teacher's voice
turn it into music from another place
all the other kids don't have that choice
hanging on to every word the teacher says

day and night - we will be touched
standing in the light - don't shadow the genius

so out of school he walks alone
soon his thoughts are flowing like a golden stream
an empty house he calls his own
this place becomes a temple to a silent dream
sometimes he will clap and sing
then deep in meditation he will learn to be
and only birds upon the wing
with upward fascination claim to be so free

day and night - we will be touched
standing in the light - don't shadow the genius

your smile, your freedom
comes to you from within
still a child with a reason
you're afraid but it's time to begin
blow the wind of change
though the words are strange - to hear
say what's on your mind
now is not the time - for fear

a summer's day in eight-one
sunlight through a window falls across the page
a young man's fight has just begun
and rising up inside him is a burning rage
they called his dream a fantasy
a song that every child has sung since time began
but just as long as he believes
standing in the light he'll make them understand
