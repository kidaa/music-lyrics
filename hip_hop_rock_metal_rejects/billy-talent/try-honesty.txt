Well I tripped, I fell down naked
I scratched my knees, they bled
Sew up my eyes, need no more
In our game there is no score

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty, Try honestly
Hop in your dumptruck, reverse for good luck
Right over me, Right over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, Die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry Agony, Cry agony

I'm insane, it's your fault, so sly
Your well of lies ran dry
And i cut the cord, free fall
From so high we seem so small'

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty, Try honestly
Hop in your dumptruck, reverse for good luck
Right over me, Right over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, Die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry Agony, Cry Agony

I talk to you

I'm insane, it's your fault
Try
I'm insane, it's your fault
Cry
I'm insane, it's your fault
Cry

Forgive me father, why should you bother now?
Forgive me father, why should you bother now?

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty, Try honestly
Hop in your dumptruck, reverse for good luck
Right over me, Right over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, Die Tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry Agony, Cry Agony

Cry Agony, Cry Agony
Try Honesty, Try Honestly
Cry Agony, Cry Agony
