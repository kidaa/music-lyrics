Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know
Put concrete in my veins
I'd always walk home alone
So I became lifeless
Just like my telephone

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I'd have to check my mirror
To see if I'm still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches
Alone in the bathroom

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain

Teach us that it's just a phase
When I grow up my children
Will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
I know it put me under ground
At seventeen

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain
There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
And I just died today
