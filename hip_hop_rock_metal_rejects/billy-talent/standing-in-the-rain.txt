My head, it hurts
Each day it's getting worse
My looks and smile
Have now become my curse
Tight lips, red skirt
The neverending street
Big car, little man
My lover for a fee

So if you see me will you just drive on by?
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye?
And if you want me well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
20 years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin' through my veins

My head it hurts
Each day its getting worse
No sun, my room
Has now become my herse
Cold sores, im beat
Got bruises on my feet
My pride, these men
Have taken it from me

So if you see me will you just drive on by?
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye?
And if you want me well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby

Standing in the rain
20 years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin'through my veins

Standing in the rain
Standing in the rain
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Mother, I have lost my way
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby

Standing in the rain
20 years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin' though my veins
Standing in the rain
Mother, I have lost my way
Standing in the rain
Mother, I have lost my way
