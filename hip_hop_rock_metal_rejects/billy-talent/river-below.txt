Rejected since day 1
My name is, Bastard Son
I've been dead so many times I've lost count
Blue collar working man
Defaceless masterplan
But go work with a mental side on

I'm sinking, I'm twisted
I'm broke and you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red blood and then we'll all go

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The frontpage and the fame

Contraption 
Made of bones
Nuts and bolts
Creates them
New monster
Brought your family tree down
Tick tocking
Times up now
Split second
Though it fell
Lonley hearts
Never had nobody

I'm sicking, I'm twisted
I'm broke and you can't fix it
Don't make me cause I'll do it
Red blood and then we'll all go

Into the river below
I'm runnig from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane 
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The frontpage and the fame
I'll take all the blame
The frontpage and the fame
Into the river below
Into the river below
Into the river below
Into the river below

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane 
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame 
The frontpage and the fame
Yeah I'll take all the blame
The frontpage and the fame
But you'll all know my name
And they'll think im insane
But you'll all know my name
But they'll think im insane
