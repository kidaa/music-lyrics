Oh my girl
Your so hot when you walk you melt snow
And now that disco has finally grown old
Lets buy back our souls
So lets see
Ya we've got 5 bucks between you and me
My mental dishes are finally clean
So cleared are we

Cut the Curtains the actors have gone home
Cut the Curtains the actors have gone home
The intermission's a mission on it's own
The intermission's a mission on it's own

Now here seems our wax wings have melted away
And we've only been here for one day
My faith fades away 
So don't be a grey cloud when there's none in the sky
We found theres no hidden treasure to find
At least we tryed

Cut the Curtains the actors have gone home
Cut the Curtains the actors have gone home
The intermission is a mission on it's own
The intermission is a mission on it's own
So dry your raincheques you cant put time on them
So dry your raincheques you cant put time on them
Grab your suitcase we don't have time to fold
Grab your suitcase we don't have time to fold

There is no doubt you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt you throw your inbox out...

Cut the Curtains the actors have gone home
Cut the Curtains the actors have gone home
The intermission is a mission on it's own
The intermission is a mission on it's own
So dry your raincheques you cant put time on them
So dry your raincheques you cant put time on them
Grab your suitcase you don't have time to fold 
Grab your suitcase you don't have time to fold 
We don't have no time to fold
We don't have no time to fold
we don't have no time to fold...
