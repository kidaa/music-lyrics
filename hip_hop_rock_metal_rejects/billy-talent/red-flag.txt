Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
the red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tommorow don't need today when they live in the sins
of yesterday

Well I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is the minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two

Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose
And then the hunt will be on for you

We don't need them

Like the smallest bee packs a sting
Like the pawn checkmates a king
We'll attack at the crack of dawn

Build a ladder if there's a wall
Don't be afraid to slip and fall
Speak for yourself or they'll speak for you

We don't need them

Light a fire
There'll be water
Like a jury
Needs a liar
Like a riot
Turning over
Like a madman
Needs a martyr
