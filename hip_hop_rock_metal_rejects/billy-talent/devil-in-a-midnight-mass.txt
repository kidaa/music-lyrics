A devil in a midnight mass,
He prayed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive but now I'm singing

[Chorus:]
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Violent knight at the edge of your knife
Guilty, guilty... won't make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
You're guilty!

A devil in a midnight mass,
the temple he just passed.
Attempt a dozen hits,
Can never wash away his sins

I was told that the world wouldn't believe me.
In the cold, sinners world, tried to see them.

Mother nature, Sister fear.
A place called Hell is close to here.
Put my trust in God that day,
not the man that taught his way.
I was alive, but now I'm singin'

[Chorus]

[Whispered]
Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
Your bed is made and it's in the ground [x2]

[Screamed]
Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound.
Your bed is made and it's in the ground [x4]
