when i looked at her face
and i know that she'd changed
your my all time plack
then the sky turned grey
your my all time plack
then the sky turned grey

and so i sat in my room for 27 days
no she never called
i had somethin' to say
but no she never called
i had somethin' to say

well i don't know much and i don't know how
why would she put me threw such torture
i would have given my life for her
she was the one that left me over
now i'm lovesick and i'm not gonna call her

[Chorus]

will i bet she's great
another boyfriend's lame
she could go to hell
it'll never be the same
she could go to hell 
it'll never be the same

we'll my open worms
well they time i'd say
your my all time plack
then the sky turned grey
your my all time plack
and the sky turned grey

[Chorus x2]
