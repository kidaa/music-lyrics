What you see is what you get don't you know
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget don't you know
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

Today I don't feel pretty
And i'm tired of trying to fit right in
Don't think they're just so great
Cause being great must suck

We don't always see the bright side
We all need ego suicide
You hung my id today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So set 'em straight and finally say

What you see is what you get don't you know
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget don't you know
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

My heart is in the right place
So wipe that smurk right off your face
Don't make me feel like that
Cause that's just plain not nice

We don't always see the bright side
And I lied when I said I was fine
You slammed my face today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So set 'em straight and finally say

What you see is what you get don't you know
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget don't you know
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
You stole my luck from me
And now my fortune cookie's empty
Cause you came and you stole it all from me
So set 'em straight and finally say

What you see is what you get don't you know
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget don't you know
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
