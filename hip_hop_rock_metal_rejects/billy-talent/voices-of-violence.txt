Dont wait for a knight in shinin armor
Your savorous reflected in the mirror
These flowers have grown from blood stains on the ground
Go rake them leaves off your grass and my grave
The fact is everyone bleeds when they shave
Theres no use, so dont denie there just the same

We'll take it back...
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back...
Voice of violence, voices of violence...

These cowboys will ride off in the sun set
Once there toys have doned another profit 
Back fire, these smokin guns will never rest
Unlease the skeletons from the closet
These Strangers like friend that you've never meet 
They'll send them shipments to hold my gun 

We'll take it back...
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back....
Voices of violence, voices of violence

Even after im dead and burried 
i'll still remember, i'll still remeber 
Even after im dead and burried 
i'll still remember, i'll still remeber 
Even after im dead and burried 
i'll come back for ya, i'll come back for ya

We'll take it back...
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back....
Voices of violence, voices of violence

Voices of violence will always be herd 
Voices of violence, voices of violence
voices of violence will always be herd
Voices of violence, voices of violence
