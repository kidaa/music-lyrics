All we shared was a mattress, and a lie, and an address
Baby I don't need you, well baby I don't need you
Once occupied by a goddess, now it's a room full of boxes
She said, "it's time to leave you" but baby I don't need you! 
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

I never got the whole story, not 'til after she left me
Baby I don't need you, well baby I don't need you
Word on the street is she fucked him, while we were playing in Cleveland
Well baby I don't need you, you're fading in my rearview

In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick!

Reset my memory!

In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes...
