what you think is wrong
living in the shadows
i can tell that you have lost your soul
living in the shadows

We said this all before
your is at the door...
we said this all before

don't you tell me
what you think is wrong
living in the shadows
close your eyes and you will lose your soul
don't you tell me
what you think is wrong
living in the shadows
i cant tell that you have lost your soul
living in the shadows
dont you tell me
what you think is wrong
close your eyes and you will lose your soul
living in the shadows
dont you tell me
what you think is wrong
living in the shadows
i can tell that you have lost your soul
living in the shadows
