Titmouse sings
Near the house door
Wake up brothers, saddle the horses
Titmouse brings the message of war

COme on sisters
Shine our heavy swords
Then go open the gates
Your brothers must ride to the war

I cut my battle axe
In the green oak
Onto my spear I tread
Here we swear the oath

Almighty god of war and thunder
Watch us from above
Now we are the hunters
To the hunt we go
Father moon, high in the sky
Light our way tonight

Two bloody rivers flow
Down from the hill
There my enemies lie
By my sword they're killed

From their bones we made the bridge to home

This is our warchant
It gives us courage and makes us strong
