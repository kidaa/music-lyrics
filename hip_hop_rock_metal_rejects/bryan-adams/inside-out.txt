the biggest lie you ever told - your deepest fear 'bout 
growin' old 
the longest night you ever spent - the angriest letter you 
never sent 
the boy you swore you'd never leave - the one you kissed on 
new years's eve 
the sweetest dream you had last night -- your darkest hour, 
your hardest fight 

i wanna know you - like i know myself 
i'm waitin' for you - there ain't no one else 
talk to me baby - scream and shout 
i want to know you - inside out 
i wanna dig down deep - i wanna lose some sleep 
i wanna scream and shout - i wanna know you inside out 
i wanna take my time - i wanna know your mind 
ya know there ain't no doubt - i wanna know you inside out 

the saddest song you ever heard - the most you said with 
just one word 
the loneliest prayer you ever prayed - the truest vow you 
ever made 
what makes you laught, what makes you cry 
what makes you mad, what gets you by 
you highest hight, your lowest low - these things I want to 
know 

i wanna know you - like i know myself 
i'm waitin' for you - there ain't no one else 
talk to me baby - scream and shout 
i want to know you - inside out 
i wanna dig down deep - i wanna lose some sleep 
i wanna scream and shout - i wanna know you inside out 
i wanna take my time - i wanna know your mind 
ya know there ain't no doubt - i wanna know oyu inside out 
i wanna know your sould - i wanna lose control 
c'mon n' let it out - i wanna know you inside out 
ya gotta dig down deep - i wanna lose some slieep 
i wanna scream and shout - i wanna know oyu inside out 
tell me everything...
