Could have been a winner, 
Should have taken me. 
It was so damn cold I shoulda held ya 
'Cause you were shakin' me. 

Well, I almost had a question,
When she led me home, 
I spent too much time for one night 
Bein' alone. 

She said you're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me. 
You're wastin' time, 
You're takin' a chance on me.

Should have got the rambler, 
Back seat movie for two. 
I spent too much time for one night 
Bein' alone with you. 

Should have seen her daddy 
'Case he said she had to go. 
I spent too much time for one night
Bein' all alone. 

She said you're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me. 
You're wastin' time, 
You're takin' a chance on me.
