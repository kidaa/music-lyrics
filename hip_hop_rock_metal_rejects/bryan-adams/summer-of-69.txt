I got my first real 6-String
Bought it at the Five'n'Dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was in summer of 69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Joey got married
Should have known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
This summer seemed to last forever
And if I had a choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's where I met you, yeah!

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'll wait forever
Oh, when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah!
Back in the summer of 69!

Oh, it was a killin' time 
We were young and restless
But needed, too in a while
I guess nothing can last forever, forever, no!

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Lookin' at everything's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old 6-string
I think about you and when what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, when you held my hand
I knew that it's was know or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah!
Back in the Summer of 69!
