Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight 
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
Well I been doing my homework all week long 
Now the house is empty and the folks are gone....hey!
C'mon everybody! 

Well we're gonna have a party so we better put a guard outside 
Cause if the folks come home well they're really gonna have my hide 
Well there'll be no more music for a week or two 
No more hangin' round with the usual crew....hey! 
C'mon everybody!
