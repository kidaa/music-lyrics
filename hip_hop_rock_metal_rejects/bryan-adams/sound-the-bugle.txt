Sound the bugle now - play it just for me 
As the seasons change - remember how I used to be 
Now I can't go on - I can't even start 
I've got nothing left - just an empty heart 

I'm a soldier - wounded so I must give up the fight 
There's nothing more for me - lead me away... 
Or leave me lying here 

Sound the bugle now - tell them I don't care 
There's not a road I know - that leads to anywhere 
Without a light feat that I will - stumble in the dark 
Lay right down - decide not to go on 

Then from on hight - somewhere in the distance 
There's a voice that calls - remember who your are 
If you lose yourself - your courage soon will follow 

So be strong tonight - remember who you are 
Ya you're a soldier now - fighting in abattle 
To be free once more -Ya that's worth fighting for
