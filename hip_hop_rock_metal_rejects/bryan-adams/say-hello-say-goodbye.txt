The costumes, the scenery that make up the props
The audience that lifts you when you're down
The headaches, the heartaches, the packing, the flops
The sheriff who escorts you out of town

There's no business like show business
There's no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
Knowing that you get that happy feeling
When you're taking that extra bow

There's no business like show business
There's no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
Knowing that you get that happy feeling
When you're taking that extra bow

Say hello say goodbye
Good to see you're glad to rock and roll you
Say hello say goodbye

You're the ones that really stole the show yeah
Split your spats as you're gone thru the band
It's good to move, to groove to you tonight
Tip your hat, to the boys in the band
Sorry but it's time to end this show yeah
