May it never be said she's knockin' them dead
But is there a fame, it's such a cryin' shame what they're sayin'
It's more than a game that they're playin'
At the start as we all should know
That she's some kind of sleaze, that's a social disease
Shut up, shut up

Don't tell me that my best friend's a menace
She might wind up in a book written by Guinness
It's all right with me, if she wants to be
As loony as the day she was born
Shut up, shut up

Call her name in the air and she'll soon be there
If you want her to be
Round me a bend and I'm needin' a friend she comes to me

The story book lies, there's stars in her eyes
She's one of a kind and I sure am glad that I met her
I couldn't have found one much better
But there's something we all should know
She's a kind of a gnu that belongs in a zoo
Shut up, shut up

Don't tell me that my best friends like Alice
Who might wind up in a looking-glass palace
It's all right with me, if she wants to be
As naughty as the day she was born
Shut up, shut up

Call her name in the air and she'll soon be there
If you want her to be
Round me a bend and I'm needin' a friend she comes to me

Don't tell me that my best friend's a menace
She might wind up in a book written by Guinness
It's all right with me, if she longs to be
As nutty as the day she was born
Shut up, shut up

Call her name in the air and she'll soon be there
If you want her to be
Round me a bend and I'm needin' a friend she comes to me 

Shut up, shut up
