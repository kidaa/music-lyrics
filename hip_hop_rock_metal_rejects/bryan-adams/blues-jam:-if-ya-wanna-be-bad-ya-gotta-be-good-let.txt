She gotta nasty reputation and a talent for sin 
She's the kinda trouble - I like to be in 
I wanna be her lover - I wanna be her slave 
She's the kinda woman makes me wanna misbehave 
She said  I'll give ya what you want boy - but lets make it understood 
If ya wanna be bad - ya gotta be good  
She's say's  there'll be no lyin' - no foolin' around 
No seven day weekends - no nights on the town  
She said  that's the way I want it - that's the way it's gotta be 
If yer lookin' for trouble - better get it from me 
So get on your knees boy - and do what you should 
If you wanna be bad you gotta be good  

Let's make a night - let's make a night 
To remember - to remember 
From January - from January 
To December - to December 
Let's make a love - let's make a love 
To excite us - to excite us 
A memory - a memory 
To ignite us - to ignite us 
Let's make honey baby - let's make honey baby 
Let's make sugar darlin' - let's make sugar darlin' 
Sweet surrender - sweet surrender 
Let's make a night - let's make a night 
To remember - to remember 
All life long
