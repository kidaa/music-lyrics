I'm feelin' tired, my thoughts are lost without you
But I won't quit, I'll go down with my ship
Until I find you

Good thoughts are like wine, I think I'll bottle and share them
Please take the time, to open your eyes and shine
Until I find you

They can say what they will
But I really believe
Yes I really believe
I'll catch you if I can
I'll catch you if I can
I'll catch you if I can

They can say what they will
But I really believe
Yes I really believe
