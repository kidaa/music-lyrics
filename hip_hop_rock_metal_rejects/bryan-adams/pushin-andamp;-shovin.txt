I could love her if she were a Rolls Royce
But she handles like a model - T
So get her in high gear, she can't stay here with me

At show time she'll be in the front row
And she'll try to put the make on me
Her friends will all laugh
While their instamatics flash
Will you see me all meanwhile
And she'll push and she'll shove and I'll smile

If you cast a glance in her direction
She's sure to wrap herself around your knees
She's always pushin' and shovin' at me

She can't control herself, it seems she's fallen off a shelf
And I can only say, Why me
And she'll push and she'll shove desperately

I could love her if she were a Rolls Royce
But she handles like a model - T
So get her in high gear, she can't stay here with me

If you cast a glance in her direction
She's sure to wrap herself around your knees
She's always pushin' and shovin' at me

Pushin' and shovin'
Pushin' and shovin'
Pushin' and shovin' me
