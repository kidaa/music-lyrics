This is a song for a star
If you really are a star
Here is a song for you all
Take a lesson before you fall

We're caught in the middle of everything
It's like trying to figure out which bell to ring
You think you'd made the start of it
But this is just the start of it now

Steppin' in time with your pace
Tho' we've never yet met face to face
This is a song for yourself
In the hopes that we don't do it wrong

We're caught in the middle of everything
Lookin' and turnin' out songs to sing
It could've been the start of it
But this is just the start of it now

You can be a star if you can climb
Just make sure you are in the nick of time

This is a song for a star song for a star
This is a song for a star song for a star
This is a song for a star
If you really are a star
This to whoever you are
If you really are a star
