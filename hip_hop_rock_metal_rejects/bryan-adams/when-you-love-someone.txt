When you love someone - you'll do anything 
you'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain 
you'll shoot the moon - put out the sun 
when you love someone 

you'll deny the truth - believe a lie 
there'll be times that you'll believe you can really fly 
but your lonely nights -  have just begun 
when you love someone 

when you love someone - you'll feel it deep inside 
and nothin else can ever change your mind 
when you want someone -  when you need someone 
when you need someone... 

when you love someone - you'll sacrifice 
you'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice 
you'd risk it all - no matter what my come 
when you love someone 
you'll shoot the moon - put out the sun 
when you love someone
