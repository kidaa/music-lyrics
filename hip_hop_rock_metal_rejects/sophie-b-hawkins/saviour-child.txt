Hey child 
You're so wise 
Will you tell me what you're thinking 
I don't need an answer 
Just to talk to you awhile 
I stop searching 
When I see you smile 

Yeah child 
I am crying 
'Cause I know just how you're feeling 
But there won't be an answer 
For a long long while 
So promise me 
You won't stop dreaming 

Color rainbows in the rain 
And follow to a heart of gold 
There's a saviour born every day 
In the valley of your soul 

It's you child 
So learn the truth 
Though most folks they'll keep on lying 
There will be an answer 
Just you give yourself the time 
And promise me 
You won't stop trying 

Color rainbows in the rain 
And follow to a heart of gold 
There's a saviour born every day 
In the valley of your soul
