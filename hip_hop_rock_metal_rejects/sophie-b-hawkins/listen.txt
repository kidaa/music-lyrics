Listen
I love the way life screwed up the way you're looking at me 
I love your face 
Listen I don't mind a temper 
But baby I can't chew my supper 
I can't even swallow water 
I'm all filled up 
With my sweet disorder 
And I'm about ready to take my elbows off this table 
I'm about ready to take this whole world all inside 
I'm about ready 
To cry 

I'm gonna turn you on 
You're gonna set me free 
I'm gonna make you come 
You're gonna live with me 
And all the ways I twirl my hair 
And all the ways I tie my shoe 
I walk away to make sure you care 
I shimmy back to you 
Oh darling love is real 
That's why it seems insane 
'Cause all these things we feel 
Comes down like pouring rain 
And when I say your name 
I'm gonna turn you on
