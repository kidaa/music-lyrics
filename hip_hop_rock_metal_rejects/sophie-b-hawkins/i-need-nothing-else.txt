I ain't gonna be your fool 
You know this lady is not waiting for words untrue 
I have to die 

'Cause I'd rather crawl home bleeding than be 
Chained to you I love your freedom 
Hate me need me love me tease me 
Beg me please me take me breathe me 
Baby you know I'm trouble still you 
You wanna be the one to smash my bubble 
How strong how tough how sweet how must 
You feel to rough me up for real 

In love I trust I put my faith 
To make me happy to keep me safe 
In you I find a way to lose myself 
Thrill me baby I need nothing else 

I ain't gonna be your dog 
You know this lady's contemplating your worth at all 
I'll make you cry 

'Cause I'd lose you than lose my way 
Oh you know I don't mean it I only suffer when I go astray 
Your words they sting you make me sing 
I want to bring you everything 
Jesus I feel what you mean to me 
I want to meet you on a dirt road and walk with you endlessly 
Oh Lord my God when you get hard 
How can I stop how can I not 

In love I trust I put my faith 
To make me happy to keep me safe 
In you I see the brightest star 
That burns inside me and breaks my heart 
And when I cry the deepest hurting 
Cleans my soul relieves my burden 
In you I find a way to lose myself 
Thrill me baby I need nothing else 

[solo] 
I need nothing else 

In love I must feel all my pain 
And all my joy and all my shame 
And every time you call on me 
Through my struggles you set me free 
To feel your power your gracious strength 
And on my knees oooh it's your restraint 
That makes me find one greater than myself 
Love me baby 
Love me baby, I need I need I need I need 
I need nothing else
