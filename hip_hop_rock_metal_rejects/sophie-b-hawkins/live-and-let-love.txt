I busted homes 
I gave up everything I own 
To come in here 
Now ain't it clear 
I'm true 
Baby you've changed 
But ain't I just the same 
As the little girl 
Who's gonna give her world to you 
Don't break my heart again 

I'm closing this door 
Kiss me 
Kiss me once more 
You're the one who taught me how to do it 

Love and let love be our desire 
Live and let life be our fire 
Stand by yourself and I'll stand by you 
Live and let love be our truth 

These walls are high 
But I was born to climb 
I've got a monkey mind 
And I will always find the groove 
I trust your rhythm so 
Do what you feel 
Kiss me 
Kiss me for real 
I'm the one who'll show you now to do it 

Love and let love be our desire 
Live and let life be our fire 
Stand by yourself and I'll stand by you 
Live and let love be our truth 

Love and let love be our desire 
Live and let life be our fire 
Stand by yourself and I'll stand by you 
Live and let love be our truth
