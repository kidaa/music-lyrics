Mmm my best friend has a little car 
She can take off anywhere, anytime she wants 
And if you ask me mostly 
Where would I rather be 
I'll tell you up and down the avenue 
In the passenger seat. 

My best friend 
Has fuzzy hair 
My best friend 
Walks with her tail in the air 
My best friend 
Makes me feel full as the moon 
I'm saving all my money and I'm gonna take her to 
Israel soon. 

Mmm my best friend has a little house 
She gave me my own keys and I go Anytime I want 
And if you ask me mostly 
Where would I rather be 
I'll tell you sitting on the window sill 
When she's close to me. 
I worried I was isolated now I'm glad I waited 
For the real thing 

My best friend 
Has fuzzy hair 
My best friend 
Walks with her tail in the air 
My best friend 
Makes me feel full as the moon 
I'm saving all my money and I'm gonna take her to 
Israel soon 
My best friend 
She smells like patchouli and cigarettes and the street 
My best friend 
Sometimes she makes eyes at my feet 
My best friend 
You'd think we were from the same womb 
We don't like talking in the morning 
And we dream all afternoon. 

Wear big clothes and you're alright 
Don't let the spin make you uptight 
Life's a Saturday morning cartoon 
We're like balloons we're like balloons 
We come as one and we stand on line 
We don't mind waiting 'cause we're on our own time 
We don't know what the meaning could be 
It's a mix of love and ecstasy
