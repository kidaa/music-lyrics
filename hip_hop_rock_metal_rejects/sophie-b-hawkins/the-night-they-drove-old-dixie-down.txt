Virgil Cain is my name 
And I served on the Danville train 
Till Stoneman's cavalry came 
And tore up the tracks again 
In the winter of '65 
We were hungry 
Just barely alive 
I took the train to Richmond had fell 
It was a time I remember oh so well 

The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the bells were ringing 
The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the people were singing 
They went... "La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la" 

Back with my wife in Tennessee 
One day she came to me 
"Virgil, Look, come see!  There goes Robert E. Lee!" 
Well I don't mind chopping wood 
And I don't care if the money's no good 
But you take what you need and leave the rest 
And they should never have taken the very best 

The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the bells were ringing 
The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the people were singing 
They went... "La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la" 

Like my father before me 
I am a working man 
And like my brother above me 
I took a rebel stand 
He was just eighteen 
Proud and brave 
But a Yankee laid him in his grave 
I swear by the blood beneath my feet 
You can't raise the cane back up when it's in defeat 

The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the bells were ringing 
The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the people were singing 

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la 

The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the bells were ringing 
The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the people were singing 

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la 

The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the bells were ringing 
The night they drove old Dixie down 
And all the people were singing 

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la...
