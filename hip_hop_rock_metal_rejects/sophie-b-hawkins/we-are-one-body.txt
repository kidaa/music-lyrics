I used to view the world as 
Some things good and most things bad 
But if you'd be my lover 
I'd be more than what I am 
And drifting on your ocean 
I could shut my engines down 
But deeper currents were in store 
And I'm not anchored anymore 
Your kiss your kisses set me free 
I wasn't listening before 
Your lips your tongue your hands your feet 
You gave everything back to me 
I want you need you to feel free 
Now all I want is to be this free 
To touch to feel what you give me 

We are one body 
We are one spirit 
One breath 
One dream of life and death 
One God 
One sex 

It's in your solar system 
It's in my super star 
There's nothing more persistent 
Than the planet of our heart 
The flame that is between us 
Could set every soul on fire 
And I would love to take that heat 
Let's fill the whole world with desire 
Your kiss your kisses set me free 
It's too painful to deny 
Your lips your tongue your hands your feet 
History it's illusion 
I want you need you to feel free 
Come on make love to exclusion 
To touch to feel what you give me 

We are one body 
We are one spirit 
One breath 
One dream of life and death 
One God 
One sex 

We are one body 
We are one spirit 
One breath 
One dream of life and death 
One God 
One sex
