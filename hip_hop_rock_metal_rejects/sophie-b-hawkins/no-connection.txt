I'm tired of waking up 
I'm sick of rolling off the bus 
I want to sleep forever 
In the lies I've made 
The checks have bounced 
But the bills got paid so far 
On the Jaguar 
I call myself 
The lines get crossed 
On the short wave 
I get cut off 
'Cause I can't behave 
Very well 
You think you know me 
But you don't know my way around 
Hell 
Is just below me 
And that's why I keep falling down 

I'm praying to resist temptation 
Staying within my constellation 
Weighing every intonation 
Betraying alienation 

I quit sobriety 
I joined up with insanity 
I want to pull the lever on the hatch I built 
Escaping truth and avoiding guilt 
So far 
In the family car I get away 
The border's nearer than I thought 
I'll drive all day and I won't get caught 
Anyway 
The light is fading 
And I haven't had time to call 
You must be waiting 
For someone whose engines 
Won't stall 

I'm feeling the strings of your rejection 
Kneeling in the wrong direction 
Sealing my heart to your neglection 
Revealing no connection
