I met a woman from another time 
I couldn't think 
But a drink from her eyes 
Was like water to wine 
She wet my dreams with her distinctive mind 
I search the desert for a treasure 
And a measure of life denied 
I'm driven by cars and guitars and her voice 
Ripping up and down my spine 
And now I'm giving my life for her sight 

To be mine 
And in her presence 
My fate unwinds 
For when her essence 
Draws me too near 
I can taste her with tears 
On my tongue 
Like the sun 
In my mouth. 

I met a man who kicked my front door down 
He blew in with the Santa Ana winds 
And a half cocked hound 
He fits my body like a one horse town 
And I was drunk like a vagabond on his street 
And I lay face down 
And I rode his joy like a child on a merry-go-round 
I was young in his eyes 
I was sweet on his thighs 
I was profound 
I was shot like a free bird in flight 
To the ground. 

I woke this morning from a deadly dream 
He was my lover he was my filler 
He was my chocolate-colored killer 
He was me 
I'm built to run 
My will is to deceive 
But you penetrate severely 
I am walking insecurely 
On my knees 
And I will wait through Winter, Spring and Summer 
If you'll Fall in love with me 
I will dance so slowly 
You will hardly know I 
Breathe 
From Rome 
To Madrid 
To Paris 

On the breeze 
My scent will find you 
Lost by degrees 
From time to time you'll 
Sing 
With my lips 
Or my hands 
On your hips 
Or my tongue 
Like the sun 
In your mouth
