I want to walk beside you 
Nowhere that I have ever been 
And of the dreams inside you 
I am the one you have not seen 

You make me feel a school girl 
Restless to take your point of view 
Into my mystery world 
Finding that one is more than two 

I feel abused 
By my own mind 
I can't refuse 
An offer to make love to you 

How come your words affect me 
I have not wanted to be bound 
And yet I may be set free 
Before the meaning was the sound 

In your refrain 
I hear the chords of love in vain 
How can I help but call your name 

From dusk 'til dawn 
I'm haunted 
By your demon song 
Don't make me play alone too long
