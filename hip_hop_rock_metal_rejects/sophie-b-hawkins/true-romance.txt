Try 
To make me run away 
I will only hang around and wait 
For you 
I could never fall too fast 
I found my true love at last 

In you 
And it would make me cry 
If you should ever leave my side 
Darling put your hand in mine 
Come with me now we can fly 
To paradise 
How can we doubt it 
We can't live without it 
So fine 

Come 
Into my open wounds 
Don't ask me if I'd die for you 
Darling it's not worth living 
Under any other circumstance 
This is a true 
This is a true romance
