Holy Moses I have been removed 
I have seen the spectre 
He has been here too 
Distant cousin from down the line 
Brand of people who ain't my kind 
Holy Moses I have been removed 

Holy Moses I have been deceived 
Now the wind has changed direction 
And I have to leave 
Won't you please excuse my frankness 
But it's not my cup of tea 
Holy Moses I have been deceived 
Yes I have 

I'm going back to the border where my affairs 
Where my affairs ain't abused 
I can't take no more bad water 
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes 

Oh, and it hurts so bad 

Holy Moses I have been removed 

Holy Moses let us live in peace 
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease 
There's a man over there 
What's his color? 
I don't care 
Holy Moses let us live in peace 
Holy Moses why can't we, why can't we live in peace? 
Holy Moses let us live, let us live in peace 

Why can't we? 
Oh Lord, why can't we live in peace 
He's my brother 
She's my sister 
Let us love each other
