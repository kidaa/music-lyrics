Nightmare bring me to the dawn 
I must ride your body on 
Deep inside me I know you can't hide me from harm 
I'm the secret that you bear 
Born of anger and despair 
Who will strangle me 
Who will untangle my hair 

Come to me I can see 
Through the holes in your eyes 
When I scream out in terror 
You're the one by my side 
Run to me strong and pure 
As the monster's child 
We've been captured for a lifetime 
But we're free when we're wild 

Sleep my little darling 
Don't 
You 
Cry for mamma 
She's all gone 
Nightmare came and took her in his arms 
Find your dark horse 
And ride on your course 
Through the storm 

Lay me down you can see 
Through the rain in my eyes 
That I've no more to lose 
And I've nothing to hide 
Playing in midnight fields 
Of dreams exiled 
We are strangers in the city 
But we're free when we're wild
