I'm a wounded soldier on a downtown train to your place 
You've launched a secret heart with your face 
You don't always say what I want to hear but you move me 
Across the rooftops and into the deepest blue sea 

Did we not choose each other 
Are we just heroes for a day 
This time I will stand by you 
And mine is the heart I will save hey-ey-ey-ey 

I drew a hard line but I just can't see it 
You colours are bleeding all over my bullshit 
I wanna be your star but I gotta learn to feel myself 
I want your love and I need your help 

Did we not choose each other 
Are we just heroes for a day 
This time I will stand by you 
And mine is the heart I will save 
Can we not judge each other 
I'd rather wipe your tears away 
I can follow my heart till the end 
But I just can't choose the way 

Just because we live like dolphins together 
So many reasons to break the wave 
We can swim from streetlamp to streetlamp whatever 
We can be kissing in the rain hey-ey-ey-ey 

Can we not judge each other 
I'd rather wipe your tears away 
I can follow my heart till the end 
But I just can't choose the way 

[solo] 

Listen baby listen baby don't you do me wrong 
I can make my bed you can sing your song 
Ain't nobody else gonna make you shine 
If it's truth you seek then darling love you'll find oooh 
I don't wanna I don't wanna take your pain away 
It isn't yours to give oooh it isn't mine to save 
Here's my heart here's my hand here's my soul 
Take it in take it apart take it easy let it go ooh-ooh
