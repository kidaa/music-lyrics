I have no confidence 
And I can't see why I should 
But I could do most anything for you 
And you know I would 

I try too hard 
And then I give up way too easily 
I'm the runner up inside of you 
And you're the winner inside of me 

Lose your way 
And I will follow 
Here today 
And here tomorrow 
Like my freedom I know 
I'll never let you go 

I still wish on the evening star 
And I s'pose I always will 
Every child loses something 
A whole life can't fulfill 
And when you cry I feel the sky 
Burst open in my veins 
If loving you makes a slave of me 
Then I'll spend my whole life in chains 

Lose your way 
And I will follow 
Here today 
And here tomorrow 
Like my freedom I know 
I'll never let you go. 
Walk the line 
I'll walk inside you 
Change your mind 
Let your love decide you 
It's the reason I know 
You'll never let me go
