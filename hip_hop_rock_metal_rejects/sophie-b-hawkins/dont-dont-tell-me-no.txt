I never thought that I could 
Crush upon your sandy shores 
Like the feeling of your warm security 
It's not like me 
Now I come with strange excitement 
At your very touch I'm frightened 
Don't I ask too much you tell me 
'Long as I can keep on yelling 

Don't don't tell me no 
I want you to take my hand 
Never ever let it go 
Even if I make you mad 
Darling every bit of love you give 
You will get more back 
If you believe it 

Who cares if it's forever 
There's no time when we're together 
Who cares if we don't worry 
We don't even have to hurry 
This our world awaiting 
For the sweetest penetrating 
Love that we have found why can't we 
Splatter it around and around 

Don't don't tell me no 
I want you to take my hand 
Never ever let it go 
Even if I make you mad 
Darling every bit of love you give 
You will get more back 
If you believe it 

Don't don't tell me no 
I want you to take my hand 
Never ever let it go let it go 
Even if I make you mad 
Darling every bit of love you give 
You will get more back 
If you believe it 

Why don't you stay 
You make me laugh like it's for ever 
And cry like I have never 
You heal my pain 
Why can't we pray 
Let's take the time to feel the weather 
And love the world together 
It's the only way 

Don't don't don't don't tell me no 

Don't don't tell me no 
I want you to take my hand 
Never ever let it go 
Even if I make you mad 
Darling every bit of love you give 
You will get more back 
If you believe it 

Don't don't tell me no 
I want you to take my hand 
Never ever let it go let it go 
Even if I make you mad 
Darling every bit of love you give you give 
You will get more back 
If you believe it
