I wanted to be loved 
I wanted to be known 
I wanted to be held 
I wanted to be thrown 
Into this world 
I wanted to be your little girl 
I wanted to be shy 
I wanted to be dumb 
I wanted to be blind 
I wanted to be young 
As a child 
I wanted to feel myself 
Worthwhile 
You shot like star dust through me 
And I wanted you to be 
All that I would ever need 
And my trial 
Is leaving now while I'm still strong 
I wanted you to be the one 
Though you knew it all along 

I walk alone 
God speed your love 
God take me home 
I walk alone 
God be my judge 
God still my soul 

I tried to be your wife 
I tried to be your friend 
I tried to take my life 
I tried to understand 
How I failed 
In your eyes I can't prevail 
There's nothing more that I can do 
But carry on without you 
Finding love in spite of truth 
And I sail the seas of destiny's song 
In my heart I may hold on 
But you'll reach and I'll be gone 

I walk alone 
God speed your love 
God take me home 
I walk alone 
God be my judge 
God still my soul 

I walk alone 
In God I trust 
Where I belong 
I walk alone 
In God I must 
Proclaim my own
