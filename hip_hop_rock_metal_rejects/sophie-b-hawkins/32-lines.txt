I want your hand 
Across my belly 
I want your breasts 
Upon my back 
I want your pain 
To rip right through me 
I am your death 
You are my wrath 

I'll take your hand 
Beyond the threshold 
I'll take your gifts 
As art of fact 
I'll take your tongue 
Right down to my throat 
You are my loss 
I am your map 

I find your eyes 
They give me shelter 
I find your lips 
They give me peace 
I find your need to take me over 

Open my heart 
I'll tell you stories 
Open my legs 
I'll read your mind 
Open my mail 
I'll tell you're forty 
You are my fate 
I'm your design 

I'll lead you o'er 
The city burning 
I'll lead you home 
To Provincetown 
I'll lead you down 
The soft dunes yearning 
You're my vision 
I am your sound 

I long to be 
Your handsome woman 
I long to feel 
The crease of time 
I long to free 
Medusa's stallion 
I'm your water 
You are mine 

I need to carve 
Your face in pavement 
I need to die 
In your embrace 
I need to keep 
A grave engagement 
You're my power 
I'm your disgrace.
