It felt like spring time on this February morning 
In the courtyard birds were singing your praise 
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel 
Alright I carried them with me today now 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

I wonder why 
I feel so high though I am not above the sorrow 
Heavy hearted 'till you call my name 
And it sounds like church bells or the whistle of a train 
On a summer evening I'll run to meet you barefoot 
Barely breathing 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy oh darling 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

It's not too near for me 
Like a flower I need the rain 
Though it's not clear to me 
Every season has its change 
And I will see you 
When the sun comes out again 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy oh oh... 

As I lay me down to sleep 
This I pray 
That you will hold me dear 
Though I'm far away 
I'll whisper your name 
Into the sky 
And I will wake up happy 

I wonder why 
hmmm 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again oooh 
When the sun comes out again 
When the sun comes out again hmmm 
comes out comes out oooh 
And I will wake up happy 
So I pray
