That old dog has chained you up alright 
Give you everything you need 
To live inside a twisted cage 
Sleep beside an empty rage 
I had a dream I was your hero 

Damn I wish I was your lover 
I'll rock you till the daylight comes 
Make sure you are smiling and warm 
I am everything 
Tonight I'll be your mother I will 
Do such things to ease your pain 
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed 

Open up on the inside gonna fill you up gonna make you cry 

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue 
Give you something sweet each time you 
Come inside my jungle book 
What is it just too good 
Don't say you'll stay 
'Cause then you go away 

Damn I wish I was your lover 
I'll rock you till the daylight comes 
Make sure you are smiling and warm 
I am everything 
Tonight I'll be your mother I will 
Do such things to ease your pain 
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed 

Shucks, for me there is no other 
You're the only shoe that fits 
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it 
Damn I wish I was your lover 

If I was your girl believe me 
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones 
We could groove along and feel much better 
I could do it forever and ever 
Give me an hour to kiss you 
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure 
We don't need no doctor to feel much better 
Let me in 
Forever and ever and ever and ever 

I sat on a mountainside with peace of mind 
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear 
Walked for days with no one near 
And I return as chained and bound to you 

Damn I wish I was your lover 
I'll rock you till the daylight comes 
Make sure you are smiling and warm 
I am everything 
Tonight I'll be your mother I will 
Do such things to ease your pain 
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed 

Shucks, for me there is no other 
You're the only shoe that fits 
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it 
Damn I wish I was your lover 

Just open up I'm gonna come inside I wanna fill you up I wanna make you cry..... 
Damn I wish I was your lover 
Gettin' on the subway and I'm comin' uptown.... 
Damn I wish I was your lover 
Standing on a street corner waiting for my love to change.... 
Damn I wish I was your lover 
Feelin' like a school boy, too shy and too young.... 
Damn I wish I was your lover 
Open up I wanna come inside I wana fill you up I wanna make you cry.... 
Damn I wish I was your lover 
Gettin' on my camel and I'll ride it uptown.... 
Damn I wish I was your lover 
Hanging around this jungle, wishing that this.....
