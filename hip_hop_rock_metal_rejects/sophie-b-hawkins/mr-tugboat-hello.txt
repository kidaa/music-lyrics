You won't be strong 
For me I'm sure 
Oh how could I have lost my heart 
To one so insecure 
Desire hard to resist 
But for whom I exist 

Love I give my eyes to read your signs 
No compromise your faith is mine 
I don't despise the endless time 
It takes to realize that I 
Am just a fool 
Though you were cruel 
To show me paradise so soon 

I don't know why 
I hardly care 
Happy disillusions fade 
When passion's in the air 
Fire water and salt 
Madness inspired 
Pain, let it remain my fault 

Hate me for a while I saw you cheat 
It's not my style to break the heat 
Murder is vile and death is sweet 
I have to smile at my defeat 
Yes I'm insane 
Though just the same 
You must have recognized my name 
Oooh 

Mr. Tugboat hello 
Ocean liner finer day no ma'am 
Oooh and I have no plans 
Just to do as I please 
Back to the breeze 
Oh sailing round my island 
Everybody's outside 
Love has arrived 
I wanna be your friend 
Living it up together baby 
Give me up I'll 
Drive you crazy 
Can't find me a baby 
So climb 

The story's true 
I can't deny 
First thing I was born to see 
Was mama cry 
Raspberries and wine, boxing gloves 
Train stations and valentines 

Paris I'm in debt I can't come home 
My lips are wet I hate the phone 
J'ai un regrette et mes chansons 
I bumped my head while you were gone 
You thought for you 
As though for two
