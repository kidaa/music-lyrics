Father, she's playing our song, but I don't wanna dance tonight 
You had to slip away, and I'm caught inside the cage again 
I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't, 'cause I don't wanna fight 
I wish I was miles away, not feeling anything 
You taught me to hide while I'm frightened of my life 
You taught me to smile while I'm crying inside 
And I'm black and I'm blue and I'm wondering where are you 
I wish I was there too.. 

With you miles away, not feeling anything 
You and I again, gliding the wings on end 

Father I'm slipping away and I don't only wanna feel my life 
reigning inside my heart, tearing nobody's world apart 
And if I fall, let me fall in your arms 
And if I die, let me take you along 
Nobody will rescue me, they don't know I'm gone 
Tonight the see is black and calm 

And I am miles away, not feeling anything 
You and I again, gliding the wings on end 

I'm miles away, not feeling anything 
You and I again, gliding the wings on end
