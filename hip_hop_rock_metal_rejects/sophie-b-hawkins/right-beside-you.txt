I'm dancing in the shadows of life 
And death is all around me tonight 
I miss you making love to me right 
Beside myself I'm holding you tight 
Someone is waiting for me to rise 
And dive into the ocean I cried 
And I cried and I cried my baby to sleep 
Beside myself my soul to keep 

Right beside you I see 
Right beside you I stay 
Right beside you I'll be 
Right beside you always 

We're dancing in the shade of the summer sun 
The drums are playing the change to come 
Was yesterday in the heat 
Beside myself I need to keep 

Right beside you I feel 
Right beside you I am 
Right beside you I kneel beside you 
Right beside you I stand 
Right beside you I see oooh 
Right beside you I stay 
Right beside you I'll be 
Right beside you always 

Driving into town with the top down 
Sun sinking low into the water I can feel your speed 
One hand on the wheel one hand on my knee 
I can tell you what I want you can tell me what you need 
Darling nights are getting cooler and the city's so close 
There's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast 
We'll arrive on time just a little bit late 
It's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste 

I remember when I was a child 
You made me up to be your lover 
Now I'm sitting right beside you 
Other people still exist 
I don't pretend to love them less but darling 
When you drive this way I lose my breath 

Right beside you I feel 
Right beside you I am 
Right beside you I kneel beside you 
Right beside you oooh I stand 
Right beside you I see beside you 
Right beside you oooh beside you I stay 
Right beside you oooh I'll be 
Right beside you 

Always 
Right beside you I feel 
Right beside you oooh I am 
Right beside you I kneel beside you 
Right beside you I stand 
Right beside you I see beside you 
Right beside you oooh I stay 
Right beside you beside you I'll be 
Right beside you oooh always
