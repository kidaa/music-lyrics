You don't know why I'm crazy 
I don't know why you're blue 
You messed with my head you messed with the dead now I'm gonna mess with you 
I don't know why you're lazy 
I'm so in love with you 
What's God gonna see who's God gonna know when's God gonna help us through 
I can't deny I can't explain I can't reply I can't refrain 
I want his hands I want his chest I want his feet I want his sex 
I am the child I am the whore I am the wild woman at your door 
I need to touch I need to talk I need to love I need to give you you up 

What am I fighting for 
If I win I lose my life 
I need you more and more to break my will tonight 

Only love can set us free 
Only love can bear the truth 
Only love can bring us peace 
Only love can save me and you 

Oh daddy what I've been thinking 
Only heaven knows 
What's Ma gonna see who's Ma gonna blame when's Mama gonna carry you home 

I have the urge I have the mind I have the touch I drank the wine 
I want the loss I want the pain I want to start my life again 
I can't define I can't forget I can't explain the feeling of regret 
I know the dead I'm not alone I made my bed I want to let you you go 

What am I frightened for 
If I speak I lose my mind 
You've broken down the door and there is no place to hide 

Only love can set us free 
Only love can bear the truth 
Only love can bring us peace 
Only love can save me and you 
Only love can purify 
Only love can conquer fear 
Only love can testify 
Only love can make a miracle of life 

Only love can set us free 
Only love can bear the truth 
Only love can bring us peace 
Only love can save me and you yeah 
Only love can purify 
Only love can conquer fear oooh 
Only love can testify 
Only love can make a miracle of life ooh no
