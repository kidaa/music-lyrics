Falling falling 
Into the river of your soul 
For me to know 
I am floating on this current to somewhere 
Where love abounds 
Distant calling 
The sun goes down the beasts start home 
Say come along 
I ain't about to shake off this sweet water 
It's warm 

Oh babe you weren't wrong 
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff that keeps me hanging on 
My home is in your jungle, with your skies so blue 
Those monkeys gave us much to love, you copy me I'll copy you 

Kissing kissing 
Beneath the trees we know so well 
If they could tell 
Of generations 
Hugging hugging 
And rubbing go much slower 
As you get low 
I don't want to miss on one sensation oh babe 

Oh babe you weren't wrong 
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff that keeps me hanging on 
My home is in your jungle, with your skies so blue 
Those monkeys gave us much to love, you copy me I'll copy you 

Babe it's alright 
I can swing on anything as long as when I come you hold me tight 
My home is in your jungle, with your skies so blue 
Those monkeys left us much to learn, you show me how I'll show you too 

Oh babe you weren't wrong 
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff that keeps me hanging on 
My home is in your jungle, with your skies so blue 
Those monkeys gave us much to love, you copy me I'll copy you 

Babe it's alright 
I can swing on anything as long as when I come you hold me tight 
My home is in your jungle, with your skies so blue 
Those monkeys left us much to learn, you show me how I'll show you too 

My home is in your jungle, with your skies so blue 
I'll show you too babe 
Oooh 
My home is in your jungle
