I saw you there 
All I wanted was to start with you 
Was the hardest thing I ever had to do 
Till I made you care 

Yo brother 
You sure heard me 
Banging on the big drums for your love 
You called me baby then 
Talked to me like your best friend 
When the time was right you were so good 
Asked me what I like 
And I said 

Don't stop swaying baby 
You soothe my soul and I stop searching 
When I get lost in the rhythm 
Everything stops hurting 
Don't stop swaying baby 
Take it slow 
And I keep yearning 

Again I fall 
Lighter than the morning dew 
Fresh 
'Cause I always never knew 
What I'm stumbling on 

Yo sister 
You sure heard me 
Singing in the rain for some love 
You took me unaware 
Said things to make me care 
Now the time is ripe and you're so good 
Ask me what I like and I say 

Don't stop swaying baby 
You soothe my soul and I stop searching 
When I get lost in the rhythm 
Everything stops hurting 
Don't stop swaying baby 
Take it slow 
And I keep yearning

Hansel and Gretel are holding hands deep in the forest. They are lost. This is 
their own story. The two have fallen in love, and so, after a long quietness 
amidst the creatures of the night, they begin to kiss. Traveling like heat 
through each other's bodies, they pass through centuries of insecurity and into 
a rhythm where they are not afraid. 
Don't stop swaying baby... 
Mamma has led these children into the wild unknown for reasons, known, with 
father's help, of course, they tried very hard to get back home, but of course, 
they could not. 
Don't stop swaying baby... 
And so, they find themselves through the darkness, through the sadness, making 
love, making peace, making music. They find themselves, through the chaos, 
making sense. This is what they want. This is who they are. These are the 
things they need. 
Don't stop swaying baby...
