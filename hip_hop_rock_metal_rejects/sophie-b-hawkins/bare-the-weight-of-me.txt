Oh I 
Never knew 
I was unkind 
'Til I met you 
So how 
Can I believe 
You will suffer with me 
If I should ask you to 

Bare the weight of me 
Bottom belly legs chest hands feet face of me 
Stare into space because of me 
Dare to let nobody take the place of me 
Why has it been so long 
I long to be the one 
You have a handle on 

For I 
Never cared 
To be led 
Beyond my despair 
And how 
Strange to now see 
Crumbs of deceit 
Following me 
So how can you 

Bare the weight of me 
Bottom belly legs chest hands feet face of me 
Stare into space because of me 
Dare to let nobody take the place of me 
Why has been so long 
I long to be the one 
You 
Have a handle on.
