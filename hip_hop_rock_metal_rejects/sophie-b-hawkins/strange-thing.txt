In our lives 
Love has hid her face to save her heart from breaking 
Into feeling 
In your eyes 
Joy gives way to pain 
Save your tears for the rain 
Visions stop at the ceiling 
Without each other 
What would we be 
We long to feel free 
And in our dreams 
We see 
What we need 

I hardly recognize myself it's such a strange thing 
To find another woman walking in my blue jeans 
I've come so far and I've been so long away from home 
I'm like a photograph who's image is still changing 
The letter that I never sent to you explaining 
All I want is a place for my heart to belong 

In our minds 
We have weapons and cures for disease 
And a light year in the instant that it takes us to conceive 
Without each other 
Where will we go 
Someday we will know 
And if we want to 
We will grow 
Closer and closer together 

I hardly recognize myself it's such a strange thing... 
To find another woman walking in my blue jeans 
I've come so far and I've been so long away from home 
I'm like a photograph whose image is still changing 
The letter that I never sent to you explaining 
All I want is a place for my heart to belong
