I lied 
I stole in the name of fear 
But I won't be silent here 

I don't want somewhere to run to 
I don't want somebody I can shake 
Lord I want my dignity again 
Before I walk on fire 
You gotta look me in the face 

I won't flinch 
And I won't turn away 

I'm sorry 
I'm sorry for being scared 
But I won't drop you there 
Oh darling 
Let me show you I love you 
Oh world 
Let me show you I care 

I don't want somewhere to run to 
I don't want somebody I can shake 
Lord I want my dignity again 
Before I walk on fire 
You gotta look me in the face 

Give me back my touch 
Give me back my feeling 
Give me everything 
I wanna be your witness 
I want you to believe in me
