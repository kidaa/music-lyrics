You can do it baby... you know you can do it baby 
You were always the darkest childe 
Making all the grown ups sweat 
Driving both your parents to distraction 
With the sweetness in your head 

You're the one who raped your superintendent 
On the rooftop tied his hands and feet to the fence 
You sucked his cock and fucked the man immobile 
You paid your daddy's rent 

You are the darkest childe 
You spread your angel wings 
And fly through the night into the dreams of ancient ruins 
And make them sing 

Lost lover shameless girl 
Bury me in your sultry curls 
I'm in the wilderness alone 
Let me kiss you until the dawn 
Let me put your wilde things on 
I've been howling in the fog so long 

You are the darkest childe 
You have a sacred duty to perform upon this blessed Earth 
You must cradle those thoughts of the lustful lonely 
Inside your wicked warmth 
And you must 
Get off 

You are the darkest childe 
And evil will never stop you 
And people will mock you and try 
To pop pop pop you into the market place where you cannot be bought 
Understood you will be missed 
There will be sadness 
For the darkest childe 

So long 

So long to the darkest childe 
Waiting in patient anguish 
For the scent of someone's wilderness 
To howl against the smog screen 
Of accolade smoothies 
Goose bump burgers and Christ-like fries 
How long can this world keep fucking itself up the ass 
Wonders never cease 
How long would it have to be 
Anyway 
Long enough to cause hysteria 
Wide enough to cause great pain 
I am in the wilderness alone 

Oh god 

Let me kiss you until the dawn 
Let me put your wilde things on 
I've been howling in the fog so long
