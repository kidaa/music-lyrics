Do you love your mother 
The way I love mine 
Expecting nothing of her 
'Cause she was changing all the time 
I couldn't take my mother 
And I'll never hate my home 
But I learned to rock myself child 
And get on 

Do you feel your mother 
The way I feel mine 
I tried to change the nature 
But now I like it 'cause it's mine 
And I let you love me up 
And I let you bring me home 
And I could go away 
But I don't wanna 

I don't wanna be too smart 
I don't wanna talk too fast 
I don't wanna look too precious 
First impressions never last 
There's always complications 
Weird vibrations 
Frustrations 
Have patience 

Do you love your mother 
'Cause God I love mine 
In a dream she let me love her 
Gotta hand it to my mind 
In case you never meet her 
I'll tell you what it is 
She was lonely like a woman 
But she was just a kid 

Oh mama.... 
What are ya doin'?........ 
Yeah yeah yeah..... 
ooohhh...... 
shit..... 
Carry me.....
