Oh angel it's understood 
What we could 
Do together's every bit much better than good 
I ain't looking for the sky to 
Cover my head 
Cover me I'll cover you again and again and again 

Stay up all night to feed your fire 
My day's a dream with you on my mind 
I wake up tight full of desire 
And you are the one who can unwind 
My weather's always a surprise 
Don't think you'll ever come prepared 
But love's the lighthouse in my life 
If you get scared 

When you look in my eyes 
Do you have faith like me 
Love can heal the wounds 
That cry us all to sleep 
When you hear nature's voice 
Whispering in your ear 
Is heaven a-rejoicing 
Even through the tears 
When you become your light 
Shining like the sun 
Is peace within your mind 
Where everything is one 
Evil will not destroy 
When love is in your hand 
Now we can make believe 
The mysteries we understand 

Us angels we give it up 
Just enough 
Keep each other hanging on with a heavenly touch 
I ain't playing with a goal to 
Cover my ass 
I am naked like a baby in the summer grass 

New York's the only place I know 
I'll take you on a guided tour 
Through Central Park where only those 
With seven senses feel secure 
Then from my rooftop in the clouds 
We'll drive into the glowing sea 
And when we're falling look around 
And tell me what you see 

When you look in my eyes 
Do you have faith like me 
Love can heal the wounds 
That cry us all to sleep 
When you hear nature's voice 
Whispering in your ear 
Is heaven a-rejoicing 
Even through the tears 
When you become your light 
Shining like the sun 
Is peace within your mind 
Where everything is one 
Evil will not destroy 
When love is in your hand 
Now we can make believe 
The mysteries we understand 
Repeat twice
