She's not a girl who misses much 
Do-do-do, oh yeah 

She's well acquainted 
With the touch of a velvet hand 
Like a lizard on a window pane 

Man in the crowd 
With the multicoloured mirrors 
On his hobnail boots 

Lying with his eyes 
While his hands are busy 
Working overtime 

The sole confession of his wife 
Which he ate and donated to the 
National Trust 

I need a fix cause I'm going down 
Down to the abyss that I've left up town 
I need a fix cause I'm going down 

Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 
Mother Superior jump the gun 



Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
Happiness is a warm gun 
Bang, bang, shoot, shoot 


Some guy: Josephine, do you think you are going bald? 
Josephine: No. You've asked me that before and the answer was no then.
