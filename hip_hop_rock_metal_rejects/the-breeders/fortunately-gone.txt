I wait for you in heaven 
On this perfect string of love 
And drink your soup of magpies in a 
Pottery bowl that looks 
As I am now, brown, round and warm 

Chime on a rain wet 
An ankle, toes or two 
Sweetly as it drops upon your head 
Just like it did today 

Fortunately gone 
I wait for you 

Chime on a rain wet 
An ankle, toes or two 
Sweetly as it drops upon your head 
Just like it did today 

Fortunately gone
