Da-da... 
Tripping 

I walk to where he's sitting 
It's all salty salty 
He knows It's good, it's real, it's pretty 
It's all salty Timmy 
It's all salty Timmy 
It's all salty Timmy 

He said Doe Doe Doe 

Dared leave 
We've burned the field completely 
Ahhh... last light 
I feel it's real, it's pretty 
It's all salty Timmy 
It's all salty Timmy 
It's all salty Timmy
