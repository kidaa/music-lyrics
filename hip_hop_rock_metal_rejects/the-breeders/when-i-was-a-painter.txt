In side lakes of Quarterly? I've been 
Heard stories of air velveteen 
Twenty hours later I fill the room 
With bad sex and bad TV 

Go, go, go *2 

When I was a painter I painted you well 
Too bad I have to die 
You brought the essentials, perversion appeal 
And many lovers at one time 

Go, go, go *2 
On and on, on, on 

In side lakes of Quarterly? I've been 
Heard stories of air velveteen 
Twenty hours later I fill the room 
With bad sex and bad TV 

Go, go, go *2
