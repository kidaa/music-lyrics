We were rich once 
Before your head exploded 
Imagine doing just what the Big Bang did 
The whole world 
Knew it was loaded 
Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't ever coming down now 

I just wanna get along 
I just wanna get along 

I look up 
The heads fly over 
I see a boy I know: his hair's on fire 
The whole world I discovered 
If you're so special why aren't you dead 

I just wanna get along 
I just wanna get along 
I just wanna get along 

Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't never coming down 

I just wanna get along 
I just wanna get along
