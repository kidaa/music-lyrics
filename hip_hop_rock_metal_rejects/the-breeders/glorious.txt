Da-da... 
Ahhh... 

Hold my breath for three more years 
Yeah, three years 
On my own on Saturdays 

It's glorious 
It's glorious 

We were tired from the sleep 
Scrabbled and we slept 
Through the window came the rain 

It's glorious 
It's glorious 
It's glorious 
It's glorious 

It's glorious 
It's glorious 

Being tired from the sleep 
Hold my breath for three more year 
Yeah, three years 
On my own on Saturdays 

It's glorious 
It's glorious 
It's glorious
