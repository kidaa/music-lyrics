Drivin' on 9 
You could be a shadow 
Beneath the street light 
Behind my home 

Drivin' on 9 
I sure miss you 
Pass a motel 
Looking at the piles 

Drivin' on 9 
Looking for one thirty 
Maybe I passed it 
Go another mile 

Drivin' on 9 
Drivin' on 9 

Drivin' on 9 
I sure look pretty 
Carson City 
Walking down the isle 

Drivin' on 9 
Does daddy have a shutgun 
He said he'd never need one 
Go another mile 

Drivin' on 9 

Drivin' on 9 
Looking out my window cell 
Wondering if I want you still 
Wondering what's right
