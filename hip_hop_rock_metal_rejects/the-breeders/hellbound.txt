It lives in folds of red and steamy air 
It lives in misery 

Hellbound 
Hellbound 
Hellbound 
Hellbound 
Hellbound 
Hellbound 

Oh, oh we're falling 
Falling down 
Down... 

It lives, dispite the knives internal 
It lives marry me 

Hellbound 

Oh, we're falling 
Falling down 
Down... 

It lives in misery
