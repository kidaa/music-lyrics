He's the Invisible Man 
Count the bubbles in your hand 
The southern skies 
And the summer sites 

That's all that's left behind 
The skies, and a sweet caress 
He's the Invisible Man 
Catch him if you can 

You're nowhere in sight just imagine that 
Nothing excites you baby, that's a fact 
Open your eyes 
Look and you will find 

That's all that's left behind... the skies 
And a sweet caress 
The skies, the sights 
And a sweet caress 
He's the Invisible Man 
Catch him if you can 

That's all that's left behind... the skies 
And a sweet caress 
The skies, the sights 
And a sweet caress 
He's the Invisible Man
