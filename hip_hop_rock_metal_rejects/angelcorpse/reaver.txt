Total war witchery damned conjuration
Leather winged covens of death scar the skies
Rivers of fire, blood and defamation
Bloated seas of rage steep fearless eyes
Demonthrong clatter on cloven hoof
Ten thousand exterminating angels
War vomits writhe lust up in the throat
Rended bodies become one with the soils
Bestial storm of mutilation
Reaver
Hail blasphemic revelation
Wicked regent ascends beyond
The crimson breath of chaos
A pestilential gloaming
Borne on scorpion winds
Reaver...
Total war witchery damned conjuration
Leather winged covens of death scar the skies
Rivers of fire, blood and defamation
Bloated seas of rage steep fearless eyes
Obey commands of ritual malevolence
Death and life perverse unite in infamy
The cursed few- proud bestial saviors
Rapture: the rancid flocks perish in vain
Bestial storm of mutilation
Reaver
