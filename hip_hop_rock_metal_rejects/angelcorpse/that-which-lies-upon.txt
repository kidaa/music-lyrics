Music Taylor/Palubicki; Lyrics Helmkamp
Lascivious - that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
Ripping sacred vestments - venereal debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summmon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire
Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal - emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable unborn
Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshly folds
Erected into bleakness
Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love
This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene
Lascivious - that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable reborn
