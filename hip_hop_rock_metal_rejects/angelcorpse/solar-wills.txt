Vielfour fiery
Four corners race- stretch infinity
Cataclysms celebrate
A whirling soul ablaze with spirited gleam
A silence made sullen by the lightning's voice
Four armed comet scrapes a spiritless earth
Scream eternal void
Spinning firey cycles in uncorrupt space
The whimpering age of plead dissipates
Superseding failed flesh
Epochal sorrows unformed yet ripening
Smoke ebbing rays of their dying son
Slintering suns in the abyss
Wheeling Four evolve into Fifth
Dull clay and matter grey made ambient
Fourth season's funerary call to rebirth
Obeisant before blind eyes
Darkness and light untethered
Morality and law fall away
Save that which flows from the chariot of flame
Stigmata immeasurable
As if from the very heavens
And seas of carnage lap cruel and cold
Upon still shores
Solar Wills
From beyond the starry chasm
The stirrings of genocide unfurl
Commanding swine to the abattoir
Laying in wait for the rays of the sun
A silence made sullen by the lightning's voice
Four armed comet scrapes a spiritless earth
