Suckled at the teat of the she-wolf
I was born in the light of the gibbous moon
Fathered by vengeance and carnal lust
Unholy matrimony of blood and sperm
Wolflust
Shape shift moonlight feral scent
Spurting frothing seed raracious dread
Terror bathing ensanguined venom flows
Parting the flesh of the daughters of men
Wolflust
Beast of raping blood
Pillaging unclean desire
Loathsome hellhound nightmare of death
Where shadows fall-beware
Twilight unscathing
Bloodbath infant rending
A spell a cry from limb from limb
Enter on all fours the witch
The hunger slaked my loins now spent
Silence entombs save for the howling of the damned
Hell has fufilled my blackened destiny
Bestial deeds of hell paced death
