Music Palubicki; Lyrics Helmkamp
Petals ripen glisten with yearning
Sanctified vessel inflamed
Fervent fingers twitch the gulf is closed
Envelop the pillar of alabaster
Cockroach entrenches in some awful orifice
Excavating living tissue
Barbaric caress - greased up and slick
pain scraping a backwards bending
Clamps smear open a warm paradise
Ribcage and vertebral column contracted tight
Bars stretched beneath the skin
Lips pulled back and drawn for curing
Penetrate - probing swollen infestation
Fisted into comprehension
Rigid so to bend contorted and suffer
Straight jacket of sadism
Phallelujah
Sanguinary rite of passage
Sweet tongues of fire
Phallelujah
Paroxims of union
Phallelujah
Judas tongue scrapes spit
Bites the hand that feed it
Infectious features baring cracked teeth
Bleeding gums of joy
Phallelujah...
Flaying souls breach the vestal wall
Chorus of angels consortium of pain
Enriched blood of freshly esoterica
Mingles with man in fluid form
Outpouring thrust pelvic abominations
Thick film of sweat grim lubrication
Soon to suckle maggots at her breasts
Celebrate the palsied throes of innocence
Phallelujah...
