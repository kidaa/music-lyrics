From beyond the multitude of stars
Arktos ouros- lotus petals unfurled
Portal to the vault of sun and lightning
Zeta Ursa Majoris- arms outstretched
Wheel to the chariot of the nightsky
Gammadion give us our strength- begotten
Through blood and flame
In iron embrace
The prophesied sign in the heavens
A balance of firebolts and solar virtues
The glyph of creation- father of all
The Phoenix purifies- ashes to the wind
Cleaves through the darkness of matter
Hail the death defiant- Vindex arise!
Begotten
Pregnant lightning shatters frozen joy
Foul frost creates from that which destroys
In iron embrace
Through blood and flame
Yet the memories endure
Of the final Avatara
Through the flames of the great end
Where lightning rains from the heavens
And glory wakes to walk proud
Through rites ripe with blood and faith
Upon inviolate mountain peaks
Where shines the rising sun
Begotten through blood and flame
In iron embrace
Begotten
