Lyrics:Helmkamp 6/96
Garden of earthly delights is mounting flames
We are burning the way to paradise
The lust for vengeance shall not despair
Blood and sperm-agony
War declared-now hear this...
Sodomy Curse
Fertile semen corrupted to vile seed
Obelisk of swollen beauty
Desperate ablution
Pollution
Sodomy Curse
Disgrace wept bitter tears
Spit wipes away but what of the shame
Sodomy Curse
Sodomy...
