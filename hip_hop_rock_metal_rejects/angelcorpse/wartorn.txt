Music Helmkamp/Palubicki; Lyrics Helmkamp
Corvus corax descending
Through ashes smoke and pain
Stark sepia sigil of strength
The revealing stench of victory
Lycanthropic ripping death
A baptism in annihilation
Drips from the jaws and howls
An ultimate oblivion conceived
Wartorn...
A solution for flesh and bone
The morbid throne the strong revere
With genocide
Our might makes right
Where charnal houses
Leer at the world
Where crown and cudgel
Ferocity
Rains from the skies
Withered rotted bodies unburied
Lay piled in stacks instead
Vermin swarm and vultures gather
To feast upon the dead
Anthemic holocaust and hate
Stern lord of war and vengeance
Rough beast slouching eternal
Resolves the world to dust again
Chorus
Wartorn...
