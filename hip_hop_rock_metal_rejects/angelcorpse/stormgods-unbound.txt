Fierce- steel eyed devils
For whom the sun never sets
Proud-Iron youth Of the noble cultures of the past
Striding- like greyhounds keen
Where glory beckons
Tough as burnished leather
And hard as Krupp's steel
The standard raised we wait
Our comfort- in readiness
The stoicism of the elite
Prepared for the assault at dawn
Elegant- obdurate hearts
A Volk of purity and vigor
Wicked weapons and armed encampment
A phalanx of spears- of dispassion
Bristling- furor teutonics
A steed spurred ever onwards
Action and instinct befitting
In the shadow of the sword
The standard raised we wait
Our comfort- in readiness
The stoicism of the elite
Prepared for the assault at dawn
Death's head empire
Stormgods unbound
The shores of space shall not define
Nor walls thrown up enclose our vault
And as if borne from distant stars
We rage against the bastion of
That which is still unshattered
Fierce- steel eyed devils
For whom the sun never sets
Proud-Iron youth Of the noble cultures of the past
Emblazoned- emboldened
We heathens wild
Stormgods unbound
Beholden to none
Sun wheels expansive
Through thunder and blood bold
Weltmacht oder niedergang
The heaven's charges struggle
Eternally unfold...
Stormgods Unbound
