Music Palubicki; Lyrics Helmkamp
I am the warfare
Blasting in from blazing horizons
I am the abyssic lust
Tasting blood from the lips of the dying
Plague bearer
World shatterer
I am the reaper's blade
Writhe sadistic merciless
I am become death
Caressed by pallid fingers
I am the cruelty
That chaos doth evoke
Bearer of the black standard of war
When abyss winds return
Mountains smashed - crumble down
Bring to boil a sickly sea
Dance in the ashes of my enemies
10,000 years of victory
Plague bearer
World shatterer
I am the flames
That feast upon your fears
I am the lingering coals
Spawn of blessed cremation
I am the malignant goal
Of our funerary sacrifice
A Phoenix born of the Fallen Age
When abyss winds return
