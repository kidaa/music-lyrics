All my friends are dead or they are in N.A 
They don't get up they stay right where they lay

Don't blame me if 
I can't save you now 
Beacause I try but I just don't know how 

Now's the time to make a change 
I don't wanna live that way 
Morons there are in the past 
I live each day like it was the last 

Now all my friends are dead or they are on their way
I'm covered in their blood my skin is grey 

This might be the best that 
It's ever been 
Yeah I know I'll never sing this way again 

Now's the time to make a change 
I don't wanna live that way 
Morons there are in the past 
I live each day like it was the last
