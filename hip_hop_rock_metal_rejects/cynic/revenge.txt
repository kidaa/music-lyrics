I'm sick and tired of that radio sound 
I need a new face I need a new town 
My eyes are looking up

But you won't let me play 
I gave you my love and you threw it away 
Well I'm not running again... 

I found out living is the best Revenge 
Found out living is the best Revenge 
Find some people they're not your friends 
Found out living is....
