Paper lace and long sad face 
Sun shining on the pond 
I can still remember 
All the shades of blonde on blonde 

She never said what's in her head 
But the writing in her eyes was 
Plain and clear enough

Say so, you gotta let me know 

See each other cross the way 
I sigh and you are gone 
Waves of lust consume my flesh 
`cause I've waited so long 

Why can't you say 
What's in your way 
Open up your eyes `cause what 
We want it is not wrong 
Say so, you gotta let me know 

Come down stay down 
Share the spirit world 
I can see the living dolls 
All strung with lover's pearls 

Nothing to fear 
We're safe down here 
So open up your mind and month 
The words I want to hear 

Say so you gotta let me know
