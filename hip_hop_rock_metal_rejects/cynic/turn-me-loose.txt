I'm not the lover you want me to be 
I'm just a loner man 
I got to be free 

I don't know what you want me to do 
I can't change my ways for you 

Turn me loose - Hey Hey 
Got to be free - Hey Hey 
Turn me loose - Hey Hey 
Cold Cold City - Hey Hey

I 'm gettin' sick of what 
You want me to do 
I'm not the one for you 
I can't pull through 

I don't know who you want me to be 
I'm just a loner mans 
I gotta be free! 

Turn me loose - Hey Hey 
Got to be free -Hey Hey 
Turn me loose - Hey Hey 
New York City - Hey Hey
