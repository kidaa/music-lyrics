Don't tell them anything 
`Cause they might lock you away 
Don't even sneak a smile 
You think that's gold `tween your legs 

Don't show them anything 
Don't even let on you care 
They'll know that you're insame 
Or even worse that you're square 

Better not mess with a skinny 
Little rat like me 
You'll see the depths of cruelty 

Don't stop your might creepin 
You're not alone in that crowd 
Spend all the day sleeping 
And tightly wrapped in your shroud 

Better not mess with a skinny 
Little rat like me 
You'll see the depths of cruelty 

Don't stop your day dreaming 
Just stay on top of that Cloud 
Killers and cops scheaming 
You'll stand alone but proud 

Better not mess with a skinny 
Little Rat like me 
You'll see the depths of cruelty
