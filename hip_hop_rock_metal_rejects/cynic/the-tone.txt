Hello hello yu're reached my phone 
Speak to me after the tone 
Maybe we said too much already 
Breath is short my hands ain't steady 

I didn't want you to be alone 
So I call you when I get home 
Like the way you spand my money 
Make me laugh but you're not funny 

The tone

I hate your voice I hate the pone 
Spill your guts after the tone 
I said I'd call but i never do 
`Cause I got nothing to say to you 

Maybe we said too much already 
Breath is short and my hands ain't steady 
The tone the tone the tone
