Oh com on!

Close the city and tell the people
That something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Stamp light from the wall!

Oh! You've nothing to say
They'll drag you away!
If you listen to fools,
The mob rules! The mob rules!

Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you'll burn your finger
And you'll get hold of a flame, oh!

It's over, it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools,
The mob rules

SOLO

You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools

Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might stop rolling
And take you right back around

You're all fools
The Mob Rules
