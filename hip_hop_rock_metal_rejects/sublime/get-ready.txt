Some folks say smoking herb is a crime, 
if they catch you smokin they're bound to drop the dime 
Insufferable informa crazy fools wait: 
with their fingers crossed for you to break the rules 
And in the evening when we try to jam, 
we like the music loud in this here band 
We let the bass line drop as loud as we can stand 
Somebody always gotta turn informa for the man 
I want to know right now is there one of you in the crowd are you gonna 
call 911 
and spoil all of my fun 
You crazy fool i'm in the mood 
Get ready come on now, load up the bong, crank up the song, 
let the informa call 911 
And when security police force want to arrive 
Don't try to run, don't try to hide 
just pull out the .9 pop in the clip 
and let one slip into these crazy fools
