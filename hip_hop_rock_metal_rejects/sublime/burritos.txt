I don't wanna go and party
I don't wanna shoot the pier 
I don't wanna take the doggie out for a walk 
I don't wanna look at naked chicks and drink beer 
I don't wanna do a bong load and go and wrench on the car 
I don't wanna go and hose the dogshit down 
Cause i aint even gonna get out of bed 
Keep on skankin' ronnie skank the night away 
But the time has come for us all to pay 
I don't wanna watch no porno 
I don't wanna play guitar 
I don't wanna spank the monkey 
I don't wanna go down to the corner bari 
Aint even got to listen to all the stupid shit you got to say 
I don't wanna do a god damn thing 
I aint gonna make my bed today 
I don't wanna eat burritos or read about o.j. 
Aint gonna get a head rush cause i aint gettin out of bed today
