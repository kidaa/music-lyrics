summertime and the livin's easy
and bradley's on the microphone w/ ras m.g. 
all the people in teh dance will agree 
that we are well qualified to represent the lb g 
me and louie run to the party 
dance to the riddim it gets harder 
me and my girl got this relationship 
i love her so bad but she treats me like... 
on lock down like a penetentiary she 
spreads her lovin' all over and then there's none left for me 
chorus oh take this veil from off my eyes 
a burning sun will one day rise 
so what am i gonna be doin' for a wife 
i guess i'll have to play it myself show them how we come off the shelf 
chorus evil i've come to tell you that she's evil most definately 
evil ornery scandalous and evil the 
tension is getting hotter i'd like to hold her head underwater
