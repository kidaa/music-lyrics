I don't practice Santeria
I ain't got no crystal ball 
Well I had a million dollars but I, I'd spend it all 
If I could find that heina and that sancho that she'd found 
Well I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down 
What I really wanna know my baby 
What I really wanna say, I can't define 
Well it's love that I neeeeeed 
My soul will have to wait till I get back 
Find a heina of my own 
Daddy's gonna love one and all 
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break 
And I gotta live it out 

Oh yeah un-huh 

Well I swear that I, what I really wanna know my baby 
What I really wanna say, I can't define 
Got love! Make it go 
My soul will have to... 
What I really wanna say my baby 
What I really wanna say, is I've got mine 
And I'll make it 
Yes, I'm going up 
Tell sanchito that if he knows what is good for him 
He best go run and hide 
Daddy's got a new .45 
And I won't think twice 
To stick that barrel straight down sancho's throat 
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk-ass 
What I really wanna know my baby 
What I really wanna say, is there's just one way back 
And I'll make it 
My soul will have to wait
