War between one
Supporting temptation
Relentless conclusive seduction
MOving faster, fucked up tormented
Poverty bites, but comes in second
Needing now to
Taste the magic, with slave mentality
Blistering from self inflicted madness
Accusation, trusting non one
Intolerant, sick of the bullshit
Cruising disgusted
Down roads of the fallen
Vulnerable, alluring a higher plain
Wounds only heal by looking deeper
Don't yield, find yourself
Reach inside to fink the truth
At the center of this spiral sedation
Strange purity lost in real nightmares
Accepting demise with slow torture
