Internet fraud information download
Current techno scams electronic theft
Hardware software available to all
No federal guidelines for counterfeit
ID's bank cheques
Fifty different states no unified design
No one to turn to no response no help
Falling through the cracks Internet global fraud
Transmissions fly through the bloodless eyes
Different age
Blackened skies
Closing in
Risks run high
Dangerous world we live in a dangerous world
No backup against unusual activity red flags never shown
Accounts being raped identities being taken advantage of
Intrusion of privacy credit cards drivers' licenses
Food stamps banking machines bullshit motives clear
Boundaries crashing down
Merger of conglomerates less choice more profit
Transmissions fly through bloodless eyes
Different age
Blackened skies
Closing in
Risks run high 
Dangerous world we live in a dangerous world
Names are endless but faceless
Dangerous world we live in a dangerous world
