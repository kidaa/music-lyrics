Lyr: Gus/ Mus: Stuart
Step from my shadow
Rejoin your past communion
Melt with empty dominions
Angels carrying weapons
Crying insanity left on the threshold
Frozen shaking dysfunction's not the way
Pressures building break out move away
Shed the old shake loose the unclean
Ignite the past time has come to
Grant admittance
Something deep inside me has died
Smashed down hopelessly defiled
Something inside me has died
Smashed down criminally denied
Jungles breathing cyclones of hatred
Escaping with no significance
Stand by your killing whores
Mentor filled with bitterness
Watch your back
Misleading angel spew out metaphors
Sickening beauty mystic island charms
Pointless affection to cover the real
Truth kept hidden time has come to
Grant admittance
Something deep inside me has died
Smashed down hopelessly defiled
Something inside me has died
