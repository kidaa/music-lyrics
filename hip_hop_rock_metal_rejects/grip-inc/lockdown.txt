Lyr: Gus/Mus: Waldemar
Waste
Life life inside
Anguish true wounds open raw
Sounds sliding steel
Sermons known to shackled nation
Man human meat
Senses starved left naked
World in a world
Condemned fused in wuth the underworld
Formed pressed boxed caged
Must escape into oneself
Convicted and thrown away
Undesired sub culture
Pain does not define suffering
Formed pressed boxed caged
