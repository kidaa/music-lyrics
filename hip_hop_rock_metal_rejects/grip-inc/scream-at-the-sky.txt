Patterns in the ground
Structures built for what
Real the premise
We are not alone
Truth kept locked away
Evidemce, records destroyed
Sightings shrouded in abscurity
Abductions, scarred remains
Comming to, returning from where
Testimony defies all reasoning
Scream
Secrets will survive
Never to melt away
Nothing disappears without a trace
Hanger 18 denied
Encounters called a hoax
All out conspiracy of silence
Skeptical attitudes
Enforced by policies
Denial of cover-up
The biggest lie of all
Scream. Scream at the sky
My body snakes in pure frustration
I feel you watching me
I feel you piercee my eyes
No mysteries closed with open minds
Scream, scream at the sky
Scream, scream at the sky
Scream
