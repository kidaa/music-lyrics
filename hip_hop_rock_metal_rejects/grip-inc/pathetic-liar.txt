Does a trusting face, reflect its heart
Shaking hands, or breaking wrists
Life's all a lie
Stealing glory from the hearts of others
Stood facing mirrors
Reflections thrashing in disbelief
Vile, crass, gaunt, ashen-faced
Cringing, crawling, hiking in disgrace
Shredding skin, changing face
Snake-eyed, never making sense
Blinded with conceit
Lost in total paranoia
Fallacies in judgments
But no open regret
In winter winds
or summer breeze
The only truth is fear
Pitiful, dismal, spiteful, parasite scum
Vile, crass, gaunt, ashen-faced
Cringing, crawling, hiking in disgrace
Liar
