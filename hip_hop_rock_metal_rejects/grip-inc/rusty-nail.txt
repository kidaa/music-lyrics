Low is easy to find, justice hard to achieve
Conversations always failing
Look straight ahead, see only that is real
Stop the endless search for judgement
Circumstances revolve apportunities rap defying
Stabbing pressures of decision
Like stepping hard upon rusty nails
Disease flows without resistance
See pole skin turning red
Provocation rules throughout
Burning with desire
Watching others fall away
Concealed always to stay
Behind the eyes of insanity
No compromise the poison flows freely
Bringing naked brutality
The will to command constant everlasting
Endless battle for recognition
Clear the warnings rampant negativity
Attrition of man explodes
