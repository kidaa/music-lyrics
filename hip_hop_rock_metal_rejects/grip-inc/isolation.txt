Release
Thirty years of nothing
Macabre chilling scene
Heinous is the rescue of the 
infants soulless screams
Raking up the past
Opposites attack
Adjustment brings me danger
Let sleeping dogs lay
Confronting guilt 
strange faces appear
Allies are Foreign 
conscience of blood
Taken at birth 
happiness abused
History is hanging 
for the ten score and three
Thirty long years of nothing
In exile 
stripped away 
all is lost
Sterile life static law
Sterile life static law
Thirty years of nothing
Surviving the test of time
Fermented controlled chaos
Left in a dirty malingering lie
Tested is my courage 
skeletons appear
Adjustment brings me danger
Let sleeping dogs lay
Retracing steps faking ties
Running hard saved my life
Emotional blackmail
The well of forgiveness has run dry
Sterile life static law
Sterile life static law
Thirty years of nothing
Thirty years of nothing
Thirty years of nothing
