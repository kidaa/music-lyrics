Driven to tears while being sucked dry
Beaten down, exploited, left in bits
No hint of self seeking, cold hard facts overlooked
While the ritual of disgust begins
Premeditation, no trace
Rigid execution
Of plans severe
Trust overlooked
While draining emotions
Avoiding with grace
Concerns unanswered
Slowly, methodically, breaking bonds of blood
Gown of tradition, splashed with crimson
Hidden deep in the belly of hate
Black widows bite dealt with precision
Trading her body in the pretense of love
Prevention of instinct
Survival never a second throught, submit
The wall to survive, buried absolute
Avoiding with unanswered
Hanesty betrayed
The struggle for breath begins
The web is spun breath begins
Never to let the children see the
Gown of tradition, splashed with crimson
Hidden deep in the belly of hate
Black widows bite, deaaalt with precision
Trading her body in the pretense of love
