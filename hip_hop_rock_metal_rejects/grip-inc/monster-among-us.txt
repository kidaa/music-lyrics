so swift, so silent, anonymous
uncontrolled of vile fantasy
predator, stalking his victim
lusting for power, embracing
horror
searching to fill the black
emptiness
with perversion
camillian, cruising market places
seeking the ultimate, sexual
pleasure
gaining trust, of the curious, of
the frail, of the innocent
returning, time after time, to
abdust our sacred offspring
leaving trails of devastation,
showing no remorse
wicked eyes do smile
paedophile
loved ones snatched from open
windows
suburban securities false calm
shattered
learning institutes infiltrated
praing on infants innocent
young ones
fear the stranger, he will
rip them, tear them to pieces
torture og the blackest nature
every orifice filled with semen
all cultures have to fear
beasts of society
