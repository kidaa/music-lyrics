Lyr: Gus/Mus: Waldemar
Cashing in exploit the misfortune
Of some poor bastard that eats shit unwillingly
Millions descend on morbid momentos
Outpouring of grief means outpouring of cash
Parade of pestilence
Parade of pestilence
Making profits from unfocused affection
Feeding parasites with wanton delight
Snapping grabbing all haunting collectables
Top prices paid for the memories of the dead
Rest forever fear feeds fear
Rest forever fear feeds fear
Rest forever fear feeds fear
Rest forever fear feeds fear
