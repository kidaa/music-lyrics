Tears like dirty water stain
Crass is a union a struggle to maintain
Only frozen dogs have spent nights cold as mine
Hiding the shame godless and still
To reap the good first feel the pain
Am I human answer me
Take me as I am
And feel how I feel
Am I human answer me
Can you live with less
Please answer me
Judge me come close
Hexed by Mother Nature's breath
Raised flags of chaos take burden away from me
Only frozen dogs have spent nights cold as mine
Hiding the shame godless and still
To reap the good first feel the pain
Am I human answer me
Take me as I am
And feel how I feel
Am I human answer me
Can you live with less
