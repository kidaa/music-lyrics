Carnage, at the flick of the wrist
Oh! Mortal Spirit, disdain never discriminates
To dismember is natural
To annihilate is habitual
Every step taken
Ushers in dread
Hunger forever calling
Deeper in to ugliness
Serene in debauchery
Man's caricature is his fate
Monster within
Turns inside out
Only to face
Face itself
Face itself
Face itself
Face itself
Face itself
Primitive barbarian, reprobate, born savage
