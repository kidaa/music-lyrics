vulgar, parasite
endless quest for gain
obsession turns to disease
eats through to the bone
we must, purify, where we dwell
sterilze
deliberate, intentions
discolored and stained with greed
the vultures descend to feed
merciless to the core
we must, purify, where we dwell
sanitize
endless quest for gain
obsession turns to disease
brings you down to your knees
we must, purify, where we dwell
sterilze
