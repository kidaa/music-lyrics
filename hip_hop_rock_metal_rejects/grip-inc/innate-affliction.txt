pain no one sees
pulsing through my veins
crawls beneath my skin
burns with no flame
up and down my spin
stands without form
sanity bestowed never to appear
innate affliction
sitting in my room
haunted with lament
isolation become my relief
unclear to others
burning inside
from within I am crucified
innate affliction
innate affliction
running scared in my mind
innate affliction
in my mind
