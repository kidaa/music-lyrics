Crash
Crash
Crash
Crash
Duel for control blood
On the highways of extremes
Real life drama vile vengeance
Extremities ripped
Bodies smashed in head on
Major injuries
Creating havoc danger
Pure aggression ejaculates
Rage first blood drawn
Crash
Crash
Crash
Crash
Irritation escalation domination termination
Dr. Jeckyll turns erase the rush hour drag
Fear the calling card die all are enemy
Cutting in dispute turns ugly paybacks
Gender not an issue shove turns to shoot
Crash
Crash
