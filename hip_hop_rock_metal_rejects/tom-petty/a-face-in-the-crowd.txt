Before all of this ever went down
in another place, another town,
you were just a face in the crowd
out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd

Out of a dream, out of the sky
into my heart, into my life
And you were just a face in the crowd
out in the street, thinking out loud
A face in the crowd
