My sister got lucky, married a yuppie
took him for all he was worth
now she's a swinger dating a singer
I can't decide which is worse

but not me baby, I've got you to save me
oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had
in a world gone mad, yer so bad

My sister's ex-husband can't get no lovin'
walks around dog-faced and hurt
now he's got nothin', head in the oven
I can't decide which is worse

but not me baby, I've got you to save me
oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had
in a world gone mad, yer so bad
