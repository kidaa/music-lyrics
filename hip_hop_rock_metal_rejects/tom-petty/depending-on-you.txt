I ain't ever gonna let you down
All you gotta do is trust me
I would never make you some clown
baby why won't you trust me

You give up so easily, I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you, don't let me down
I'm depending on you

baby if you can't change the world
maybe you should just change yourself
you used to be such a sweet young girl
why you wanna be someone else

you give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
is it too late now
I'm depending on you
