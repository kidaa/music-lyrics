I used to live in a two-room apartment
neighbors knockin' on my wall
times were hard, I don't wanna knock it
I don't miss it much at all

Oh yeah I'm alright I just feel a
little lonely tonight
I'm okay, most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight

I used to need your love so badly
then I came to live with it
lately I get a faraway feeling
and the whole thing starts again

Oh yeah I'm alright I just feel a
little lonely tonight
I'm okay, most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight

I used to need your love so badly
