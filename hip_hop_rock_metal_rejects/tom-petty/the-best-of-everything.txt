She prob'ly works in a restaurant
That's what her mama did
But I don't know if she ever really coulda put up with that
Or maybe she sings in a nightclub
'Cause sometimes she used to sing
But I don't know if it ever amounted to anything

But listen honey, wherever you are tonight
I wish you the best of everything in the world
And I hope you found, whatever you were looking for

Yeah and it's over before you know it
It all goes by so fast
Yeah the bad nights take forever
And the good nights don't ever seem to last
And man, we never had the real thing
But sometimes we used to kiss
Back when we didn't understand
What we were caught up in

But listen honey, wherever you are tonight
I wish you the best of everything in the world
And I hope you found, whatever you were looking for
