since d d' are both diagonalizable they commute they are simultaneously diagonalizable af diagonalizable
hence af minimal polynomial simply x which says operator 0

addition functions religion within man there have always been outer social functions community society
furthermore religion tends integrate whole range values from highest or ultimate values god intermediary subordinate values
finally gives meaning much social endeavor logic consistency meaning life
beliefs religion also reflecting values are expressed creeds dogmas doctrines form what durkheim calls credo
his view every religion pertains community conversely every community one aspect religious unit
tends support longstanding precious sentiments traditional ways thinking customary ways living
religion usually acts as powerful aid social control enforcing what men should or should not do

king muhammad 5 was known most sympathetic formation local self government made first firm promise elections may day 1957
although government was probably prepared elections by mid 1958 first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied
by this time there little doubt but what election plans were complete
although elections were local officials was not necessary conduct elections so as prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates
local istiqlal umcia offices did not campaign lost heavily
as background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections
voting preparations began fall 1959 although actual demarcation planning rural communes was completed 1958
registration figures given table 2 must interpreted caution since estimate eligible electors were made without benefit reliable census
federal program vocational education merely provides financial aid encourage establishment vocational education programs public schools

vocational educators do not claim school training alone makes skilled workers but provides essential groundwork developing skills
title 8 program national defense education act 1958 was great spur this trend toward area schools
additional courses can readily added special cooperative programs worked out any new industry if basic facilities staff program are being
local jobs can seen counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical
