he had seen few nester wagons go through country families almost starving death but he had never seen any them foot as bad off as these two
are wyoming
this mighty empty country morgan said
girls thin face haunted him
i've been mucking mine san juan but used work ranch
she rubbed her eyes stretched then sat up her hands going her hair
then she murmured you're very kind mr morgan
hungry he said
she said guess lord looks out fools drunkards innocents
no she'll all right jones said quickly
bed isnt made but you'll find plenty blankets there
just cant take any chances getting her pregnant if were sleeping together
he was thinking rittenhouse how he had left him there rock death porch splendide
just half breed 'pache never said much never meant anythin but he stuck
he wiped his lips sleeve then stared at clayton childish kind wonder
saw driftin away but tried
eyes followed him fearfully
mare had backed away
may take her us california
yes father son
they'll trample down
two horses broke from yard from circle light cast by lamp still burning house into darkness
silence oppressed him made him bend low over horse's neck as if hide from wind had begun blow far away was twisting slowly through darkness its slow search
lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire
first he thought time he had ridden gavin told him how his cattle were being rustled at far end valley
he turned lester
he killed tom do understand
mare began tire clayton felt spray snow from hoofs gavins stallion
he was fleeing running fleeing his death his life at same time
bayonet hung belt scabbard
he turned susan kissed her cheek
he had none here
we'll stampede rest
dean turned from susan took julia fortune his arms
running around moonlight almost naked slugging man rock
there's bound someone guard but hat might fool them long enough get close
he located his man
this time connected solidly mans temple felling him
sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby having been kept handy case need
you're lighter than
might need
these poured through gate joined flight
all were carrying guns they had seized up but they were half clad or hardly clad at all
mike crawled door peered
he set his bundle down
one struck muzzle one rifles projected from shoulder pack
iron hinges held but planks were danger being torn from crossbars
wagons were burning fiercely
hurry
hustle
no
using his hands as trumpet he shouted fort up
oso gave an unruffled look
hell they were fightin each other so hard they had no time anyone else
remember being told would happen so fast people would think took place overnight
more an agricultural nation they have relied their warriors only defense survival endless wars plains
empty
wildly bucking horses would make position difficult defend against charging warriors
they poured through opening valley then spread out long line come at us brandishing their lances filling morning their spine chilling scalp cry
gradually they emerged as men
god how long he going wait thought
he jerked once grass lay still
far up valley could see rees circling reorganizing
christ's sake dont waste powder one 'em
he was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he started slump
but few reached our wall
pall dust they raised made difficult see when aricaras charged again
aricaras made one last desperate charge
wouldnt matter fool
fire's too big
why should
from man st louis wilson said
carwood didnt tell she said
meant what said about fire
he meant say more but he never got chance
he was shaking anger his breath coming long painful gasps
am
can take care this
they could hear pony's feet dry leaves while then sound faded out
not now wilson said
i've had enough
he had forgotten she was so pretty
go sleep he said
afternoon when they had pulled up front broken down ranch house his hopes had been high
water was there so much spread all through dead orchard
he stood porch watched him struggling heavy harness finally went over help him
there was brush stands pine no grass could grow under places so steep cattle wouldnt stop graze
town was about what wilson expected one main street its rows false fronted buildings water tower few warehouses single hotel
would turn away from writing hope getting good look at them but never quite succeeded
his authority extended far edge counter no further
hung hook wall underneath could see his tie knotted ready slipped over his head black badge frayed respectability ought never have left his neck
what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon
having nothing else do except wait forms processed gave myself over speculations concerning hall itself
this light did not penetrate very far back into hall eyes were hindered rather than aided by dim daylight entering through fan vents when tried pick out whatever might lying or squatting floor below
could not cling past nor did wish
river was only few blocks away but an unbroken line piers prevented from seeing
as had expected he insisted visits hall would do nothing further process application
had felt draft they were making while mounting stairs
he looked dapper lightweight summer suit brown silk tie green tinted soft collar
he had looked over forms was impressed by what he had seen there
if she sensed any unusual preoccupation part her mother she did not comment upon
when station wagon drew abreast dusty dirt road led up porch culver house pamela turned wheel guiding car its familiar parking spot close house stopped
atonement if atonement were possible could only made at sacred sacrificial basin
was not thought pamela such an evil place after all
she did not pause consider what she would do if her plan should fail
knowing its ageless mass would always dwarf short span time allotted any man
pamela was glad jim was nowhere near
silence came into forest solid being clapped its hand over murmuring mouths birds whispered comfort trees
she seemed have come such long distance too far her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up greedy gloom trees
where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such scene
but she did not know which way go
every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy
you'll always girl o' dreams an sweetest flower grows
he knew anything brainy little lady her had say would plumb important as well as pleasin ear he didnt want miss word
well
after time he straightened again brushing red permian dust from his hands slapping from his six dollar levis his tailored twenty five dollar shirt
he was handsome his coal black hair eyes his fine chiseled features
he caught her eye came back around car boot wearer
now are going take or am supposed walk
god's sake
she broke off frowning
car lurched along at snails crawl left front mudguard banging scraping against tire occasionally scraping against road itself
was payday highlands he was packing lot money back into oil fields
he said
know you've got grudge against maybe cant blame
not immediately as deputy demanded
now he could only play last card what was probably world's coldest deck
he could no longer think face saving honor but only escape
he couldnt see

finally luis hernandez said what must must
others put old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles
was dark early because storm
red hogan he rode welcome cafe
he hardly noticed blue green flashes lightning hard claps thunder
was not until he moved across porch he became aware them then was too late
other five slash b men followed them inside crowding small room
he lifted skirt macklins coat took his gun from its holster tossed onto desk

they returned street mounted their horses rode through rain big house houston street

but well just dont seem sportin somehow
lesson had been learned
jury judge executioner were riding range form single unknown figure could materialize anywhere at any time dispense an ancient brand justice men new west had believed long outdated
mere fact tall figure rifle field glasses had been seen riding way was enough frighten three rustling homesteaders out upper laramie country single week
by 1898 rustling losses had been driven down lowest level ever seen wyoming

he turned looked around at lobby as though seeing things he hadnt before noticed
fact jess's horse had not been returned its stall could indicate diane's information had been wrong but curt didnt interpret this way
again he stood darkness listening but there was only scrape shod hoof plank floor
startled animal let out terrified squeal thrashed around stall
match flared he reached above his head light lantern which hung from wire loop
wont needing this
there was raw fury his eyes veins his neck were swollen
one blood all over arbuckle's blood
having all guns makes big man dont adams
curt angry enough little reckless raised his hands shoulder high
somewhere distance woman screamed
pain shot up curt's arm clear shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware he had been hit
so pitchfork whistled over curt's head
curt caught him flush nose blow which started at floor
mean anyone who stood up his rights curt said

curt followed reaching behind him shut door hook

she was moving through screen hemlocks among white birch maples
reedy music frogs had faded but presently began again growing volume until was vibrant
then off he went so casually someone else breasts better developed more obvious lower cut dress someone without mouthful wire bands an inability find words would hold him
