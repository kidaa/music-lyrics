If I like it I just do it 
Say that we have all the time we need to make it right
Don't hurry for nobody
If it ain't the thing you like
Know your place and fit your space, young man you will conform
I didn't hear my soul express those rules when I was born.
Cause I'm free to roam 'cause it's my home
You can't stop sweet inclination
The kids want the system breaking down
Not higher education
If it ain't no natural law
Then you can keep your regulations
Cause if I like it I do it

But I keep on movin' though they wanna bring me down
I've gotta run for the cover,
And I keep on smiling
Though they wanna tie me down and give me death for the lover,
And I keep on losing though I'm proving what I'm doing
I'm still groovin', and if I like it I do it

You've got to help those people break that legislation
We can overcome this suffocation,
Execute your natural liberation
Happy to enjoy rejuvenation,
All around hear the sound
No-one can stop us now,
A thousand rules for plastic fools
Now they can take a bow.
Surely there's been time to see it dosn't work by now,
So if I like it, I do it

Still I,
Keep on finding that they're pushing those distorted visions.
And I keep on living but I'm dying 'cause of their decisions,
If I keep on looking I can find a higher space
I'm still groovin' and if I like it I'll do it
