Like a fool I went and stayed too long.
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong.
Oh baby, here I am
Signed Sealed Delivered, I'm Yours
Now, that time I went and said "Goodbye"
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry.
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed Sealed Delivered, I'm Yours
I'm yours baby
Here I am baby ,now
You've got my future in your hands yeah

Seen A Lot Of Things in this old world,
But when I touched them, they meant nothing girl
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed Sealed Delivered, I'm Yours
I've done a lot of foolish things,
That I really didn't mean.
Ooh Baby, Here I am,
Signed sealed delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby,
You've got my future in your hands baby...
Yeah...
