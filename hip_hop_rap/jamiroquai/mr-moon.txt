Have you gone astray
Or lost your way
You should have seen me yesterday
Well I knew this kind of love
Was written in the stars
It"s only once or twice that you're in line with Mr. Moon
Then it was you
Took me on your cloud
Give me flowers for my pain
But with some degree of certainty
My destiny
Seemed to slip away from me
Before I got to know your name.
Just give me a chance
I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance
So how come I can't dance with you
You really turn me on
You're the one thatmakes me smile
It's Mr. Moon who plays in tune, Mr. Moon who knows
And if it's Mr. Moon who gives the sign then that's the sign that goes
I never know what to do
Till I'm there with you.
Did you lose your mind
For a day
You don't remember anyway
Like the waters of a dream
Encapsulate my mind
A place! haven't seen sits at the end of space and time
So lost in time
Than I think I'm blond
To perhance upon this circumstance is something of a miracle
So spiritual
It's verging on the physical 
Searching for a love I cannot find.
