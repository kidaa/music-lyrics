Aooowww! 
Yeah you know 
They're gonna bring it down now 
They're gonna wreck it down 
Yeah 

Something's come to rock me and I can't keep my head 
I get nervous in the New York city streets 
Where my legacy treads 
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows 
Far from humans with guns 
But now it's too late 
There's no escape 
From what they have done 
Come on 

I'm going deeper underground 
There's too much panic in this town 
I'm going deeper underground 
Well I've got to go deeper 
Got to go much deeper 
Yeah 

Hey they're gonna wreck it down 
Yeah 
Step down and down and down 
Hey yeah 
We're gonna bring it down yeah 

Some people with a pocket full of money 
And an eye full of hate 
Take a pleasure in destruction 
Of the very thing that they tried to create 
Somebody tell me why does all mankind 
Only tamper and touch 
Have a habit where they bite off more than they can chew 
And now it's too much 

I'm going deeper underground 
There's too much panic in this town 

I'm going I'm going I'm going 
Deeper underground
