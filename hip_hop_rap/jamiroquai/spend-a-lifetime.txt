Touch me in the night time
All I want from you is love
And I know you can give such sweet moments
To last me so long
Cos, you make me feel so strong
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, Baby
Make it happen
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, Baby
Oh girl
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, Baby
Cos you make me that good
And nothing else matters
Until you're in my arms, girl
And all those broken promises we made to each other
We have so much more to give
I know that we can do this
That's how I want to live
Eternally, together
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, Baby
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, Baby
Will you make it happen for us now
Please this time
You know I need your touch honey
I want your touch honey
Like the morning sun has just begun
Girl, like the rain on my window pane
Girl, if I could make you stay
More than one day
Eternally together
Oh girl I need your touch
Oh girl I want your loving
Sweet, you know that we can make it happen
For you and for me to be
And eternally together we will be
