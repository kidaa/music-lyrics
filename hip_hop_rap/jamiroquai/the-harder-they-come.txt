Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky 
Waiting for me when I die 
But between the day you're born and when you die 
They never seem to hear even your cry
So as sure as the sun will shine 
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine 
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, 
One and all 

One and all Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down 
Trying to drive me underground 
And they think that they have got the battle won 
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done 'Cause as sure 
as the sun will shine 
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine 
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, 
One and all 
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall, 
One and all And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't 

...But I'd rather be a free man in my grave 
Than living as a puppet or a slave So as sure as the sun will shine 
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine 
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, 
One and all 
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall, 
One and all ...
