Oh, do you know where you're coming from
Hey, nothing is as clear!

Imagine in your mind, oasis.
Far awide beyond our living.
Sure enough I'm tired out trying
Hang on when this world is spinning

I was left out
There was no light
There was no sound
Here in the dark
Fishin' Around For Meaning
But, I had to ask
Someone I knew
Not so far away from where I was

She said...
Hey! Do you know mmm
Where you're comin' from
Hey! Do you know... 
Now where you're going to
She said...
Hey! Have you been...
Somewhere you've never ever been before

I said well...
Nothing is as clear!

Nothing is as clear without
Holding Hand to gently guide you.

Once that disapeared
But it's so close now that I'm here beside you.

I was left down
There was no light
There was no sound
Here in the dark
Fishing Around For Meaning...

I had to ask someone I knew
Not so far away from where I was

She said...
Hey! Do you know
Where you're comin' from
Hey! Do you know... 
Now where you're going to
She said...
Hey! Have you been...
Somewhere you've never been before

...Now nothing is as clear

Ahhhhho!

Oh, do you know,
Now where you're going to

She said...
Hey, do you know now where you're coming from
Hey, have you been somewhere you've never ever been before

...Nothing is as clear!

I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
[etc.]

Imagine in your mind, oasis.
Far awide beyond our living.
Sure enough I'm tired out trying to
Hang on when this world is spinning

I was left out
There was no light
There was no sound
Here in the dark
Fishin' Around For Meaning
But, I had to ask 
Someone I knew
Not so far away from where I was

She said...
Oh! Do you know
Where you're comin' from
Hey! Do you know...
Where you're going to
Hey! Have you been...
Somewhere you've never been before

Oh, now nothing can ever be as clear
