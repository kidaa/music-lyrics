That's the way love goes
Will it change you inside out
And then it flows
To the places unfamiliar yeah

Let me tell, I'm not for you
You're so hot for me
So get on girl
Come on [x4]
I'm hot for you
So get on
I want to get it on with you
I'm sending
I hope you got the sense to read between the lines
You know that in the book it says that
For me you never seem to find the time
Come on I've waited for your phonecalls
But you must be uptown having fun
When you do that thing you do
I get so exited too
But you never think to ask me if I want to
Come with you
So honey where do we go from here
You know baby
I've been trying to find out but I'm still
Some way from knowing
Come on, you know I am
It's not exactly clear, no no
The love you should be giving me
Is the love you're rarely showing
That's the way love goes
That's the way
That's the way it goes for me and you
Come on let me tell you now

I feel you're pushing me out
Soon I'm gonna lose my patience girl
Can't understand what you're about
Cause there's no communication
You say you love to love me, love to love me
But you always keep your distance
So honey strike me off your list
If your love comes with a twist
Cause I want the part that lingered on my lips when we first kissed

Say do you love me
If you do tell me something
And make it true
Do you love me
I need to know
Baby can't you tell me where we're gonna go
Where do we go from here
I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing

It's not exactly clear no no
The love you should be giving me
Is the love you're rarely showing
That's the, That's the way love goes
And where it's taking us well we don't know
So lets move straight on ahead
And tow in the line between us girl

I think I'd sooner make this love dead
Than waste all my time on you, yeah
I'm wasting all my time
I'm gonna learn learn learn
That's the way love goes
That's the way
It's gonna hurt me so bad
But I won't let it show
I get the feeling that it's gonna
Tear out my mind till I can no longer breath

I know I'm gonna learn learn learn
That's the way love goes

Where do we go from here
I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing
It's not exactly clear
The love you should be giving me
Is the love you're rarely showing
Hey but that's the way love goes now
You know that's the way love goes

I'm so hot for you [x3]
