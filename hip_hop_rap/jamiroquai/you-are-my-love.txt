Oh, let me tell you a little story about a heartbreaker.
Honey, I don't know why you treat me so bad,
Well I tried so hard to make you see it my way,
Just think of all the good times we had.
But still you only ever want to fight with me.

We got to split apart before we kill
And start to put our minds together
We got to change this hell for leather world
And I will find myself another girl.
We got to put our weapons down.
And spread a little love around.

You know
You are my love
You are my love
Oh, yes you are
You are my love
You are my love

Ain't you the girl who did me wrong behind my back
And tried to keep me double booked
We never seem to cross the tracks
And there's so much that you over-looked about me girl,
Remember, sat down pretty on the windowsill,
And made me swallow on your bitter pill,
You thought the grass was greener over there,
While serpents snaked around your hair,
So pour a vitriolic coffee cup
And use your blackened heart to fill it up,
Well, now honey we got to put our weapons down
And spread a little love around.

You know
You are my love
You are my love
Oh, yes you are
You are my love
Yes you are
You are my love
You are my love
I want you girl
I need you so
Now we know that
It's no secret
You are my love
You are my world
Light my shwdows
Fill the heavens with stars

You are my love
You are my love
You are my lover
I need you
I want you
Don't let me go
I need you so
Don't let me go
I need you so
Don't let me go
I need you so
