You've got to stand up, stay strong start movin' in the right direction
Don't wait, too long, for people promising divine intervention
19 nine three, now I'm taking matters into my own hands
So fast, I can't see
A revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power

Well it's hard times, white lines, kids of nine gettin' down with gun crime
War zones, no homes, ain't it time we gave the dog a bone
Say brothers, sisters, step up and put yourself in the picture
This time you know a revolution if the only way that we can change change change
I want to fight the power

Question, answer, shake your hand and smile for the camera
But it's no good you should spend time in your neighbourhood
Where black kids, white kids
Now you're working overtime to be a crack kid
No job, no cash, a revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power

Still we don't seem to understand we need a revolution
Everybody wants a revolution

Who is, this man, I'm having trouble finding out where I'm coming from
Preconceptions, it's eternal human infection one chance,
Learn how you're gonna change the habit of a lifetime my soul, concerned,
That revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power

Higher, higher, now we're gonna learn to fight the power
Sunshine, new day, I only know how to get the right way
Faster, stronger, I help my brother and my soul lives longer
Blinded, I can't see
That revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power

No doubt, in time, everything is sweet sunshine
But in the meantime, mankind, is having trouble where to draw the line
We still don't, respect, and yet I thought we had intellect
Sometimes I think the music is the only hope we have for revolution

Still we don't seem to understand we need a revolution
Everybody needs a revolution
