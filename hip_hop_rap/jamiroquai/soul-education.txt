I didn't have time for school
Spent my days breaking the rules and regulations
And inbetween they're having fun
The teachers told me son, get me an education
So I had my bout of freedom
Dressed like a man through four seasons
Hey I'm steppin out so cut me loose
And as mama waved goodbye
Tears were welling in her eyes
She don't need them
I turned to her and said

I've got my soul education
You know its stitched into the clothes
That I wear
Got my life information
Upon the breeze that's blowing through my hair
Got a pocket full of rainbows
Oh and a sky to put them in so blue
So let the music come and save you.
I found a God that I can pray to
Deep inside my soul, hey.

See your mad you can't delude
That there is no substitute
For intuition, it's no superstition
So if you find your petrified,
To let some natural law apply
Then there's a whole lot missing baby yeah.
So you know i'm blessed celestially
Got a direct link with destiny yeah
Don't ask me why
I'm in the sky
And if there's green wax in your eye
Somethings money just can't buy, hey
Rags to riches, babes to bitches
But the ride don't mind cause I got my...

I Know I got my soul education...
[repeat chorus x2]
