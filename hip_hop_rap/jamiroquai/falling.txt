Sometimes in the morning 
When I wake up
I shed a tear
I'm hoping
Come the night time
You open the door and reappear

I can promise to share 
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still I dont think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or I'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You..you...
Your the one for your love I think that I would do anything
You
Your the one for your love I think that I would do anything

I miss you 
I wanna kiss you
The sweet scent of roses is in your hair
See sometimes 
When I get lonely
I still feel you beside me 
When your not there

I can promise to share 
All my dreams i will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still i dont think you care
Should i wait for your love
Or i'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause i'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You..youuu...
Your the one for your love i think that i would do anything
Hay you you you you you
Your the one for your love i think that i would do anything

Your the one
Your the one for your love i think that would anything
You know yeah you.. you ..your the one for your love 
Ii think that i...i think that i would anything

I can promise to share 
All my dreams i will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still i dont think you care
Should i wait for your love
Or i'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause i'm falling
Head over heels in love again

Help me.. ohh can't you help me
I think i'm falling in love
I think i'm falling....
