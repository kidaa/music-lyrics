Four hundred years or more
Since you came to crucify
They were taken far from home
There were promises of paradise
But if they had been told that day
They would be told that this way
To satisfy the souls of chosen men
See I had to look carefully
At the same of my ancestry
To re-define the story line again.

If I was taken for a day
And shown another day
Every child can learn a different thing
See I tried a million times
But I had to change my mind
Sadness was the best thing I could bring
On the inside he was dead and this is what he said
As he took away the bloom above the clouds
Superiority was clearly meant to be
So destiny will manifest in time.

So where has the love all gone
A troubled trail of tears will tell the take
Of how I was put down where I don't belong
Woman, Child and man for sale
For ethical slavery is just an absurdity
Now can you be alive when you are dead
With these chains of hypocrisy
The same of my ancestry
Forever stained by blood in wich you trad.
