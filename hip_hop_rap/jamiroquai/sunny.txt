Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh the dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My sunny one is shines sincere
Sunny, one so true
I love you

Sunny
Thank you the sunshine bouquet
Woah, sunny, thank you love that you brought my way
Oh now you gave to me your all and all
And now i feel like im ten feet tall
Sunny, one so true
I love you

 ...Sunny
Thank you for the truth that you made me see
Sunny
Thank you for the facts, from A to Z
My life was torn like a wind-blown sand
And then a rock was formed when we held hands
Now sunny, one so true
I love you ...

Sunny
Thank you for the smile thats upon your face
Sunny
Thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Your my spark of natures fire
Your my sweet, complete desire
Sunny, one so true
I love you
