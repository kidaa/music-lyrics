I've got a one way ticket, yeah, 
To a distant galaxy. 
I'll take a rocket to the stars, to, 
escape catastrophe! 
See time is tickin' on and on and on and on, 
And life's in short supply. 
So send me on a no-return trajectory, 
'cause everything I know, is going to die! 

Let's travel to a beautiful new world, 
Leave this world behind. 
Everybody's going to the moon. 
I'd like to stay a little bit longer, but, 
I've seen all the signs. 
Everybody's going to the moon. 

Everybody's going to the moon. 

I've got a one way future, 
Apocalyptic Doom. 
So I need a destination, 
Hope I get there soon. 
The whole night I prayed 
And soon I will be done, 
So we're to make this journey 
far beyond the stars and leave behind 
the distant love of my unsetting sun
