I'm so glad I got ya hooked up on my drug
Everybody dance to the music
Are you feeling well now you caught this bug
Everybody dance to the music
Think last time I took an overdose
Come on dance to the music
Made me realise I came too close
I bet ya wished you'd danced to the music, music, music, music

Dead can seem to bear no relevance,
Bet you wished you dance to the music
What you want to do is kill yourself
Still you don't dance to the music
I can look at you and hear your scream
Come on dance to the music
And tell me that your needle's clean
Come on dance, dance

Come on now dance to the music
I need it, I need it,
[Repeat]

Don't you get hookep up
'Cos music is the drug
Don't you get hooked up
[Repeat ]
