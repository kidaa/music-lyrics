Lately I don't wanna see the morning sun 
Lately I, I'm not much good to anyone 
Lately I don't laugh the way I used to do, no 
Lately I've been cryin' 
Lately I've been missing you 

Lately I don't wanna hear my favorite song 
Lately I, I'm finding it hard to carry on 
Lately everything I see is painted blue, oh 
Baby I've been dyin' 
Baby I've been missing you, oh 

Lately I don't know why I ever let you go 
But I want you back 
I need you back 
Without you it's all wrong 
Baby, make it right 
Bring your love back to my life 
Cuz nothing's been the same since you've been gone 

Lately I don't feel like talking to my friends 
Lately I, I feel like this pain will never end 
I don't want to go the places we went to, no, no, no 
I don't feel like smiling 
Baby I'm just missing you , oh oh oh 

Oh baby 
I want you back 
I need you back 
Without you it's all wrong 
Baby, make it right 
Bring your sweet love back to my life 
Cuz I'm just not the same since you've been gone, oh whoa 

Lately I don't wanna see the morning sun 
Lately I, I'm not much good to anyone 
Lately I don't laugh the way I used to do, no, no no no 
Lately I've been cryin' 
Baby, I've been dyin', oh yeah 
Save me from this pain I'm going through 
Lately I've been cryin' 
Lately I've been missing, missing you 

You
