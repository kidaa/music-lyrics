[1] - No other love, I'm thinking of
No other love can measure
No other love, I'm thinking of
No other love can measure

Pretty little baby
You have given me good times
And all I want to do is make it better
I can never tell you
That I didn't love you now
Cause no other love can compare to you
Ooh...

[Repeat 1]

This is something I, I must confess
You're the only lover, who can love me like no other
There's only one man who can give me what I need
You got me going crazy
Baby give your lovin' to me

If only you could see
That you are all I need
I can't walk away boy
I can't walk away

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 1]

Whoa, ooh

[2] - Baby its only you I'm thinking of
No other love can measure

[Repeat 2 until the end]
