[Faith Evans]

[Chorus]

Caramel kisses you send my way 
I won't complain, just don't go away - 

Caramel kisses you send my way 
I won't complain, just don't go away 

You made my heart melt the other day 
When we laid by the fire in the middle of May 
It was so romantic I'll say 
When you gave me your love in your caramel way 

[Chorus]

Many times before and many times again 
You'll recall to me the reasons why 
You are more than my friend 
It's not only because you were there for my kids 
It's the simple things like your caramel kiss 

[112]

Living life with you can be so right 
Loving you through the night 
Your love is so amazing, baby 
Oh, never have I felt a love like this 
Baby, I can't resist 
Something about your kiss 
Something about your kiss 

[Chorus]

Caramel kisses don't go away 
Caramel kisses baby, don't go away 
Caramel kisses don't go away 
Caramel kisses baby, don't go away 
Caramel kisses don't go away 
Caramel kisses baby, don't go away 

[Chorus till fade...]
