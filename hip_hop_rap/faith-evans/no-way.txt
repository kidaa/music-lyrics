[Chorus]

You promised not to let me down 
You promised that you'd be around 
You said I'd never hurt again 
Me believe you There's no way 

You promised that you'd hold my hand 
You promised that you'd be my man 
I need for you to understand 
For me to trust you, there's no way 

You come and go 
You stay, you leave 
You're full of empty promises 
That never came to be 
And baby you say our love was built to last 
Not love like this 
I need someone to count on 
Not just now and then 
And baby you said 

[Chorus]

You promised not to let me down 
You promised that you'd be around 
You said I'd never hurt again 
Me believe you There's no way 

You promised that you'd hold my hand 
You promised that you'd be my man 
I need for you to understand 
For me to trust you, there's no way 

I'm moving on, oh that's best for me 
You swear to make it better, babe 
But I can't believe 
Cuz I've heard it all before 
It's in the past, must look ahead 
I thought that I'd be loving you 
But I'm hurt instead, oh you 

[Chorus]

You promised not to let me down 
You promised that you'd be around 
You said I'd never hurt again 
Me believe you There's no way 

You promised that you'd hold my hand 
You promised that you'd be my man 
I need for you to understand 
For me to trust you, there's no way 

Every tear I've cried, every time you lied 
And every time you broke my heart 
Now I'm going on Rtill the pain is gone 
I'm waiting for the pain to go away 

[Chorus till fade...]

You promised not to let me down 
You promised that you'd be around 
You said I'd never hurt again 
Me believe you There's no way 

You promised that you'd hold my hand 
You promised that you'd be my man 
I need for you to understand 
For me to trust you, there's no way
