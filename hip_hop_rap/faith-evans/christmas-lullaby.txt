Fire bright, winter night. 
Here with you by the tree. 
Close your eyes and I'll sing to you, 
this Christmas Lullaby. 

Sweetest dreams, dreams come true 
I'll be here through the long night. 
Until then, I'll sing to you 
this Christmas Lullaby 

All the living room windows are frozen 
The same way they were on the night, 
I first drew a heart on the window. 
And wrote both our names inside. Inside. 

The house is dark, the candles low. 
Everyone say goodnight. 
So I'll rest your hand on my shoulder 
And I'll sing you this Christmas Lullaby
