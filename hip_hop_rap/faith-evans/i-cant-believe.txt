Chorus
I can't believe that love has gone away from me 
I can't believe that love has gone away 
I can't believe that love has gone away from me 
I can't believe that love has gone away 
I can't believe you've gone away 

112
Hours, days and nights I sat and I prayed 
Never thought that I would see this day 
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad 
A broken heart was never meant for me 

Faith
Lord, let it please rain on my face 
So that it could wash away all my tears 
If this is the house that love is in let me leave 
'cause I don't want to be hurt like this again 
I can't believe 

Chorus

112
Many times I watched you while you were asleep 
With thoughts of living life with only you 
If I had read your mind and things could have changed 
I'll give anything to be with you again 

Faith
All I ever wanted was to see your face 
And hear your pretty voice from day to day 
Now that you've gone I have no reason for feeling that way 
I can't believe you've gone away 

Chorus

112
When I look back on the times we've shared 
Our life was ok, now what else could come down 

Faith
Don't you know you were my love my only love 
And I can't believe I can't believe that you've gone away 

Chorus
