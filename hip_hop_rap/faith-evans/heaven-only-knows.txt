Who knows what tomorrow brings
And heaven only knows what's on the other side of the rainbow
All I know is what the seasons bring
And even with the seasons come uncertainty

[Chorus]
Who knows
Do you know
I don't know
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
Just imagine all the possibilities
Heaven only knows what the future holds

[Verse 2:]
God gave me a conscious heart
And my responsibility is to teach my people
Tryin to make them understand
Your will, your perfect plan

[Chorus x2]
If we come together we can change it
Take it one day at a time
Live your life and you'll be find

[Bridge:]
We can't live for tomorrow
So make the best out of today
We gotta keep the faith
If we just keep that faith through the night
We'll be alright

[Chorus x3]
If we come together we can change it
Take it one day at a time
Live your life and you'll be find
Can you imagine all the possibilities
