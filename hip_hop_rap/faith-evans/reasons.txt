Give me the reason
That I want...

[1] - Give me the reason to love you
And I want to love you more
Oh give me the reason to love you
And I want to love you more

Sitting in here thinking about you
And all the joy you bring oh baby
I just can't live without you
Cause your love means everything

[Repeat 1]

Honey I've got to tell you
Just how you make me feel
Oh baby my love will never leave you
Cause I will be right here

And you know that I would do anything
Not to lose your love, not to lose your love
Cause your love gives me the reason
And I want you more each day

[Repeat 12x]

And you know that I would do anything
Not to lose your love, to lose your love
Cause your love gives me the reason
And I want you more, I need baby

[2] - When I can't seem to find my way
You brighten up my darkest day
The reason to love you more

[Repeat 2 til end of song]
