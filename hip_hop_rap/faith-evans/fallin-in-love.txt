Oh, oh...

[1] - Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you

Sometimes I think about you
And I remember all the things we went through
And I realize that I need you
I've fallin so in love with you

[Repeat 1]

Oh it's funny how things change
Not long ago I thought my love for you would fade away
Your love gets sweeter everyday
So in love with you I want to stay, so baby

[2] - Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart 
Don't you know
And the feeling is strong
And I can't let you go

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1]

I'm all that you want and more
I just want to close the door
And share my love, and share my love
I just want to be with you
Show you that my love is true
What you don't see believe in me

[Repeat 1]
