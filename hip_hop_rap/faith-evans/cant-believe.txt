feat. Carl Thomas

[Carl:]
I always dreamed that everything would be okay with me and you,
I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes I didn't see all the things I used to, what's
going on
[Faith:]
You gave me reasons to believe that we were always meant to be 
but now I see
You were wrong
You can't keep running back to me with all those baby baby pleases no more
no more

[Chorus]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture I'm emotional I'm emotional
It's so believing your deceiving it's official I'm emotional, I'm emotional

I can't forget last night I saw you in the corner wrapped up tight
You were warm ooh
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching from the door so hurt
There you were
You gave me reasons to believe that we were always meant to be 
but now I see
You were wrong
You can't keep running back to me with all those baby baby pleases no more
no more

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You had your chance
But you threw it all away
Thought you had my love always oh baby
I don't understand I just don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness

[Chorus]
