Baby don't be afraid of  
Afraid of my love  

Since we've been together baby  
It hasn't been too long  
But I slowly feel myself  
Falling love again  
And I want to give you more of what I have inside  
But if I open up to you  
Baby you got to love me too  

2 Everytime I think about the time we spend together baby  
Holding hands and making love  
Long walks and morning talks  
I can't believe you only thought  
We were friends  
Boy you can't pretend  

1 Baby don't be afraid of  
Afraid of my love  
My baby don't be afraid of  
Afraid of my love  

Take some time to listen boy  
It's not so hard to do  
Why can't you understand  
After all that we've been through  
If you cut away your pride  
And search within yourself  
I know you'll change your mind  
Cause I'll be with someone else  

Repeat 1  

Repeat 2  

If I didn't have you baby  
I don't know what I'd do  
Cause you make me happy and I'm  
Giving you all my love  
I never want to be without you  
I don't know what I'd do  
Cause you make me happy so boy  
Don't be afraid of my love  

Repeat 1
