Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Oh yeah 

Why can't you stay 
With me for just a while 
Cuz if you leave 
You'll take a piece of me 
Why can't you stay 
With me for just a while 
Boy, you know you have the key to my heart 

Living my life without you 
Something I don't wanna do 
So please don't walk away 
And leave me all alone 
Baby, stay for just a while 

Why can't you stay with me 
For just a while 
Cuz if you leave 
You'll take a piece of me 
Why can't you stay 
With me for just a while 
Boy, you know you have the key to my heart
