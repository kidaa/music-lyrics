Wipe your tears away, you don't have to cry no more. No more 
Wipe your tears away, you don't have to cry no more. 
Take my hand, follow me, I've got everything you need. 

Long ago, I had a dream 
Someone would come and tear the years ahead. 
So I waited and I prayed that it didn't come too late 
I didn't know, know your name, but I wanted him to say to me 

Wipe your tears away, you don't have to cry no more. 
I don't have to cry No more No 
Wipe your tears away, you don't have to cry no more. 
Take my hand, [I wanted him to saycome.] follow me, I've got everything you need. 

Come to me, so that I can be, in love. 
I want to be in love 
I can't be all in life alone, no one to hold. 
But I'm still strong. 
Will I always be alone? Tell me, will I? 
Trying to wait by the phone Waiting by, by the phone 
Cause in one day soon, [Baby I'm hoping] love's gonna find me. 
That you'll take me by the hand, and you'll wipe my tears away, away, away, away. 

Wipe your tears away, you don't have to cry no more. No more, no no no. 
Wipe your tears away, you don't have to cry no more. 
I don't wanna cry. 
Take my hand, follow me, I've got everything you need. 

Will I always be alone? Tell me, will I? 
Trying to wait by the phone Waiting by, by the phone 
Cause in one day soon, love's gonna find me. Baby you'll 
That you'll take me by the hand, and you'll wipe my tears away, away, away, away. 

Oooh oooh oooh. 

Tears away 
Tears away 
Tears away 
Won't you wipe the tears away? 

Wipe my tears away 
I want you to wipe my tears away 
Won't my tears away
