[Sean 'Puffy' Combs]
Yeah I like the way this is going down huh 
Check just soak up soultry 

[Faith Evans]
[1] - See I can't give up on the way you give it to me 
Give it to me 
No I can't give up on the way that you give me your love 

[Repeat 1]

I've been wondering how you can make it better 
For me to give you all of my love 
And open up the door to my heart baby baby 
But I don't understand the way you're thinking 
Can't help the way that you feel down inside 
The love I feel for you I can't hide 

[Repeat 1 2x]

You don't know what you're doing to me 
I can't explain the way you make me feel 
It holds your body high and it's so real 
Real love everyday and the way that you 
Give it to me give it to me 
All the love I need 
And baby I hope you never leave 

All your love is all I need 
Baby don't take your love from me 
Your love is so good 
Keep on giving it to me 
Everyday and everyway 
Baby don't take your love from me 
Your love is so good 

[Repeat 1 til end]
