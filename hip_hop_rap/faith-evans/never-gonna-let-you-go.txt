If I had one wish, boy 
I'd wish you next to me 
And it could be in summer, fall or spring, boy 
'Cause you make my heart sing 
I wanna give my heart, my soul, my love to you 
Oh baby 
'Cause every day I'm not with you 
I'm missing you like crazy 
I need for you to... 

[Chorus]

I need for you to love me, hold me, touch me 
Down deep in my soul, and never let it go 
Of the love we share, no one compares to you 
I'll never let you go 'cause I really love you so 
Oh I... 
I'll never let you go, oh no 

If you must know the truth, boy 
I'm nothing without you 
Now I know what people mean, boy 
When it's too good to be true 
Because you give me joy, good love, 
good times, such happiness 
Oh yea 
And every day I thank the Lord for you, 
I feel so blessed 
I need for you to... 

[Chorus]

If you only knew 
What you really do 
Ain't never had no one that does it quite like you do 
You could spend half a lifetime 
Trying to find one like you 
That's why I am so glad I found you 
I wished upon a star and it came true 
Darling, I need for you to... 

[Chorus]
