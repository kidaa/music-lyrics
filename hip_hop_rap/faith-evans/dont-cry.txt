Take just one look around me
Tell me what you see
Your reflection and the brokenhearted memory
I tried so hard to do the best I could
You lied and now we got to get this understood

Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me

You should have took advantage
Of every waking moment
But you thought that you had time to wase
And you were so dead wrong
I tried so hard to do the best I could
You lied and now we go to get this understood

Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me

I don't wanna see your tears
I don't wanna hear your voice
Don't you know you made the choice
Boy you did me so wrong

Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me

Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me

Take just one look around me
Tell me what you see
Your reflection and a brokenhearted memory

Don't cry, don't call me
I don't want you around me
Who are you to judge me
I'm only what you made me
