All away wipe all my 
All away my tears away 
You Wipe Yes you do 
You wipe them all away You wipe 'em 
All away All of my tears away 
You wipe my tears all away 
All away You came in my life 
All away and wipe my tears away 
You wipe 
You wipe them all the away  Oh how I love You 
All away and oh how I need You 
You wipe my tears all away 
All away all away 
You wipe [Fade Out]
