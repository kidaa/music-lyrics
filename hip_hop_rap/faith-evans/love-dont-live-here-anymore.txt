[Faith Evans]
1 you abandoned me 
love don't live here anymore 
just a vacancy 
love don't live here anymore 

when you lived inside of me 
there was nothing i could conceive 
that you wouldn't do for me 
trouble seemed so far away 
you changed that right away 

[repeat 1]

oh oh 

[Mary J Blige]
love don't live here anymore 
just emptiness and memories of what we had before 
you went away 
found another place to stay another heart 

[repeat 1]

oh oh oh 

[Faith Evans]
through the windows of my eyes 
everyone can see the loneliness inside of me 
why did you have to go away 
don't you know i miss you so 
i need your love 

[repeat 1]

love don't live here anymore 
love don't live here 
love don't live here anymore 
love don't live here 
love don't live here anymore
