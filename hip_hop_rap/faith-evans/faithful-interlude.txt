Faithful to the end
She's a lover and a friend
Faithful to the end
And with this I know you can win, just stay faithful
Faithful till the end

Faithful to the end
Listen ya'll she's a mother and a wife, she is everything, faithful
Faithful to the end
Even when things go wrong and you got nobody else to call
You call on good ol' faithful
Faithful to the end
Cause I know you gotta stay faithful

Faithful to the end
She's the one that will cook and clean, wash your clothes
So you always gotta stay faithful
Faithful to the end

Ya'll just take it on home, I can't even sing no more
Faithful to the end
Yeah, I like that
