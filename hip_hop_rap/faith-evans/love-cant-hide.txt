Tears on my pillow keep falling
And I'm crying over you, crying over you
How long will the time last before my heart
Is blessed to see the day I'm back with you, the day I'm back with you
See I'm yearning for you baby, constantly I'm reminscing
Always think bout the things we used to do
And I'm singing baby

[Chorus: x2]
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Love can't hide
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
The pain inside

Am I wrong for love that's been lost and found
Looking for someone to make the claim, oh tell me
Why am I an example of heart turned cold
Looking for someone to take the blame, won't nobody take it for me baby
Reflections of your silhouette at the corners of my bed
I try to close my eyes and go to sleep, still I see you in my dream

[Chorus x2]
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Love can't hide
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
The pain inside
[ad libs]

[Bridge:]
Are my dreams of love a mirage of paradise
As the weeks turn to months
And so many sleepless nights
For the day I pray my tears will wipe away
You'll hold me in your loving arms always

[Chorus x2]
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Love can't hide
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
The pain inside
[ad libs]

[Bridge:]
Are my dreams of love a mirage of paradise
As the weeks turn to months
And so many sleepless nights
For the day I pray my tears will wipe away
You'll hold me in your loving arms always

[Chorus x4]
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Love can't hide
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
Bop ba da ba da
The pain inside
[ad libs]
