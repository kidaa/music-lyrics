[1] - Is it a game that we're playing
It seems like the cloudy days 
Keep coming in my life, whoa
Is it a game that we're playing 
You don't understand
Your love is taking over me

I know you wonder why I sometimes cry
When I should be happy I should be happy
To have you in my life Whoa
But you don't understand the changes I've been going through
Just to be happy
I need you by my side
Baby just spend some time

[Repeat 1]

Sometimes we said we'd try to make it right
But so many other things are getting in the way
In the way All we got to do is lean on each other to make it happen
There's nothing more left to say
Nothing that we can say

[2] - And I'm going crazy
Ahh..
Trying to do it by myself
But I really need your help
Badapadapada
Baby please Oh baby please listen to me
I'm down on my knees Yeah
Baby please Yeah don't walk away Oh

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]

[3] - Baby I love you and I want you to know
If you love me baby just let your feelings show

[Repeat 3 til end of song]
