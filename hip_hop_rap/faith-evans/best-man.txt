I was getting fed up 
With all your dipping out 
With every girl around town 
You know what I'm talking 'bout 
'Cause you've been caught 
And I forgave you many times 

But now I slipped up 
And while your friend was around 
I gave him a taste of my love 
I know that I broke your trust 
For a night of lust 
But don't let that break us up 

Charge it to the game baby 
I know what's going on 
When you say you're alone 
And you won't pick up the phone 
Charge it to the game baby 
You can't even hate 
Don't get up in my face 
'Cause your boy got a taste 

CHORUS:
He is your best man 
Your best friend 
I guess you didn't know 
That I had him 
I know that you hate that 
It's like that 
You were the best but yet 
He ain't so bad 

Repeat chorus 

I needed a shoulder to cry on 
But I got more than 
A shoulder that night 
I know that you're mad 
And you're angry 
Who gives a damn? 
You didn't treat me right 
You know that I love you 
More than anything 
You are the center of my life 
It was just tit for tat 
A little pay back 
Let it go and leave it like that 

Charge it to the game baby 
I know what's going on 
When you say you're alone 
And you won't pick up the phone 
Charge it to the game baby 
You can't even hate 
Don't get up in my face 
'Cause your boy got a taste 

Repeat chorus twice 

So many times you broke my heart 
I never thought that it would heal 
So I decided to return the pain 
You always make me feel 
Now I won't try to justify 
What I did but I'll tell you why 
If you think someone else is in my life 
Then maybe you'll treat me right, yeah
