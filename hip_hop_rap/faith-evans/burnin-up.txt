Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 

Sometimes you can be in love and having fun
And still not know what's goin on
Or on the other hand you separate, thinking that the feelin's gone
Feels like forever when we're together
I knew that we are destinied
So here's the last chance for the last dance
For us to bring back the dream

So baby come and rescue me
I'm burnin up!
I got somethin' for you to see
I'm burnin up!
Baby come and take me there
I'm burnin up!
Trust me you should
Hurry up!
Baby I'm just burnin up!
I'm burnin up!

[Rap:]

In the midnite
Wait a minute
I can be in a lonely place
Then along you come with the sweetest thing to say
And put the sun in my day

So baby come and rescue me
I'm burnin up!
I got somethin' for you to see
I'm burnin up!
Baby come and take me there
I'm burnin up!
Trust me you should
Hurry up!
Baby I'm just burnin up!
I'm burnin up!

So baby come and rescue me
I'm burnin up!
I got somethin' for you to see
I'm burnin up!
Baby come and take me there
I'm burnin up!
Trust me you should
Hurry up!
Baby I'm just burnin up!
I'm burnin up!

Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up! 
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
