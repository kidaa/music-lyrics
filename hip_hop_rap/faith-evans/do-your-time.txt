It's been a long time
And I hope you're doing fine
I just wanted to write you a letter
Saying hi, and explaining why
Why you mean so much to me
Well the reason is plain you see
You were always there when I needed you
And I wanted to let you know

You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

I always did believe
That our love would be
Stronger than the bars you were behind
And my heart always seem to find
Find a reason to hold on
And the purpose to be strong
Baby can't you see that I need you
And I know that you need me too

You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

And I'm writing with sincerity
Just to make you understand what you mean to me
And I can't wait till you come home
But I need you to be strong
Baby hold on

[Ad libs:]
Cause I'm down for you
You know I'm gonna do, I'll do your time for you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do
