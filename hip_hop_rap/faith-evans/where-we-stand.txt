[Intro - Chorus]
Is it too soon to love you 
Why do I believe it's perfect
Could it be I'm scared to take a chance
Think that we are moving too fast
And I don't know where we stand I don't know where we stand

[Faith]
Today you said some things to me
That made it plain for me to see
And now I do believe
That there's a chance for you and me
Elated I would be
If it became reality
I'll put away my fears
Cause only fait brought us here

[Chorus]
Is it too soon to love you
When i just meet you the other day
Why do believe it's perfect
Enspired by all the things you say
Could it be I'm scared to take a chance 
Think that we are moving fast
And I don't know where we stand I don't know where we stand

[Faith]
It's just a few days but I'm open wide
Or maybe I should take my time
I think where moving fast but I want you bad
My mind is telling me one thing 
But my body says another
I wanna be your lover

[Chorus]
Is it too soon to love you
When I just met you the other day
Why do I believe it's perfect 
Enspired by all the things you say
Could it be I'm scared to take a chance
Think that we are moving to fast 
And I don't know where we stand I don't know where we stand

[Faith]
It's hard to figure out 
In the back of my mind there's so much doubt
Why do I look for clues
When there's no reason to question you
It's only natural 
I Just gotta wait and see
Will we ever be
Will we ever be

[Chorus]
Tell me if it's too soon to love
When i just met you the other day
Could it be that I'm scared to take a chance 
Deep inside I don't know where we stand

Is it too soon to love you
When I just met you the other day 
Why do I believe it's perfect
Enspired by all the things you say
Could it be I'm scared to take a chance
Think that we are moving fast 
And I don't know where we stand I don't know where we stand
Is it too soon to love you
Why do I believe it's perfect
Could it be I'm scared to take a chance
And I don't know where we stand I don't know where we stand
