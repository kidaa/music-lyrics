[CHORUS:]
Won't you come over and make love to me, 
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while. 
Really miss your smile, oh. 
Won't you come over and make love to me. 
Baby I want ya. 

[VERSE 1:]
Every time we're together, I feel a special part of me, 
Drawing me closer...closer to you, baby. 
I can't explain....it's just a magic that we share. 
Something between us two. 

[CHORUS] 

[VERSE 2:]
Sitting here in my window, thinking of nothing but your face. 
Oh, baby, I try to remember how it used to be, 
When you used to love me, 
Love me everyday. 

[BRIDGE:]
I don't wanna fight ya. I just want you to see, 
That you are the one, the only one 
That's for me. 
Baby, let me show ya, there's no greater love. 
Baby I love you for the things you, 
And I want you to come over. 

[CHORUS] 

[BRIDGE] 

Won't you come over. 
Won't you come over. 
Baby I just wanna make sweet love, 
Just wanna show you, you are the one. 

[repeat 'til end...]
