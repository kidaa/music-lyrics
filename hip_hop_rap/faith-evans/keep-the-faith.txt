I've seen the lightning flashing 
Heard the thunder roll 
I feel the cold winds blowing 
Trying to conquer my soul 

[Chorus]

If I just hold my peace 
Let the Lord fight my battles 
If I can keep the faith through the night 

I hear the voice of reason 
Telling me to fight on 
Cuz I come to know I've come too far to turn around 

Weeping may endure for a night 
But joy is gonna come tomorrow 
Though I go through the fire 
I shall come out as pure gold 

When problems come just keep the faith 
It won't be long until the day 
Things will turn around if you just 
If you just stand your ground 

[Chorus]

When problems come just keep the faith 
It won't be long until the day 
Things will turn around if you just 
If you just, just stand your ground 

I only have to keep the faith 
I only have to keep the faith 
I don't have to fight no more no no no 

I only have to keep the faith 
I only have to keep the faith 

[Chorus till fade...]
