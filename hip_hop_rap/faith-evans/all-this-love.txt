Come on over here 
Lay down next to me 
Let me tell you something 
That I've been meaning to say 
For a long time whoa 

Baby its been some time 
Since we first met 
And every day with you 
Is like no other whoa 

[1] - All this love you're giving me 
I know just what to do 
I'll take the love you're giving me 
And give my love to you 

You give your love so freely 
And you give it so abundantly 
I just want to be able 
To give it back to you 

Come on baby 
Let me tell you 
Tell you all the things I feel 
Cause if it wasn't boy you know 
I don't think I would know what's real 

[repeat 1]

You got me singing la la la 
La la la laaa 
La la la laaa la la la 
Whoa la la la la la la 
La la la la la 
La la la laaa 
La la la laaa la la la 
La la la la la la 
You got me singing 
La la la laaa 
La la la laaa la la la 
La la la la la la 
La la la laaa 
La la la laaa la la la 
La la la la la la 

[repeat 1]

[2] - All this love you're giving me 
I want to give just let me give it back to you 

[Repeat 2 til end of song]
