[Chorus]
I remember the way, you used to love me 
I remember the days, you used to love me 

[Verse]
You don't appreciate the time 
I put into this love affair of ours baby 
I couldn't let you walk around 
Thinking it's alright to let me down 

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I gave you all my precious love 
And anything you wanted from me 
You didn't hear me calling out 
Calling for your warm affection after all this time 
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real 
And I stood around, stood by your side 
Went through all the hurt and pain 
And you turned and walked away 

[Chorus]
Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me 
Give it to me 
What a feeling it's for real 

[Chorus]

You didn't hear me calling out 
And that's not what love's about 
I remember you used to love me 
You used to love me every day 
Now your love has gone away 
I remember I remember 

[Chorus]
