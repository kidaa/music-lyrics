Nah nah nah nah nah 
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah 
Nah nah nah nah nah 
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah 

Just coming home from work to a cold empty house 
Can't even eat so hurt anticipating on this couch 
Waiting on the phone to ring or the sound of your key 
I'm faced with this reality that you're not coming home to me 

Chorus
Mailman is there a letter for me 
Please make it better for me 
Say that it's only a dream 
He's really here with me 

Rolling out the sheets as I think about the way it was 
I'm missing you I'm not go lie you were my first and only love 
It's taking every piece of me to be strong and not to leave 
Late at night I get so weak it's that fact that you're not here 

Chorus

I tried my best to stop you when you were trying to leave 
I tried to tell you that your seed's inside of me 

Chorus x2 

Just coming home from work baby 
To a cold and empty house 
I can't eat baby 
Anticipating on this couch  Is there a letter, for me x2
