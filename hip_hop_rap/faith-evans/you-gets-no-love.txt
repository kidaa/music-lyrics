feat. P.Diddy & Loon

What

I know it's not the ghetto 
I know it's not the ghetto 
I know it's not the ghetto 
I said I know it's not the ghetto 

[Rap]

You betta check yourself, respect yourself 
You betta go for self 
Because I flow for self You gets no love from me 

[Verse 1]

I tell you why there's no love 
Simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us 
Don't you know you lost my trust 

[Bridge]

People ask me where you been 
And I tell them were just friends 
Cause it's so obvious the that it's
never gonna work for us 
Oh no

[Chorus]

Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion You gets no love 
You can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again You gets no love 
Whatever you do, it will come back to you You gets no love from me

[Verse 2]

Tell you why we can't hook up 
Cause I had about enough 
Hearing all the lies you tell 
Boy I thought I knew you well 

[Bridge # 2]

People think that you're my man
They don't even understand 
Just because i let you get some that don't make you the one
We ain't even in love 
You know that you played 

[Chorus]

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion You gets no love 
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again You gets no love 

[Rap # 2]
You better
Rock my shit 
Don't knock my shit 
Because I got the shit 
To make you cop my shit you gets no love 

You better
Rock my shit 
Don't knock my shit 
Because I got the shit 
To make you cop my shit you gets no love 

I'm the 
Diva with clout 
Everybody rap about 
Check it out 
Rhymes I buss 'em, 
Problems with my life 
Don't discuss 'em 

[Bridge 3]
Boy we had a cool relationship 
But you couldn't handle it 

Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion You gets no love 
You can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again You gets no love 
Whatever you do, it will come back to you You gets no love from me

Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion You gets no love 
You can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again You gets no love 
Whatever you do, it will come back to you You gets no love from me
