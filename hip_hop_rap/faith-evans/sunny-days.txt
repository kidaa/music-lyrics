[Chorus]

You turn the rain into sunny days 
You take the clouds away 
Baby you're the one 
I feel like heaven's a step away 
He sent an angel my way 
Baby you're the one 

I remember when 
I used to be afraid to love again 
But now I realize 
That you're the one who brings the sun 
You turn 

[Chorus]

Something real I can feel 
I was searching for 
I didn't wanna hurt no more 
Then you came, made a change 
Since you came and made it right 
I can love you all my days 

[Chorus]

Can you tell me where would I be 
What would I do if I hadn't found you 
Though I've been in love before 
You can be compared to none 
Cuz you really bring the sun 

[Chorus]

I always try to hide the way that I feel 
But I can't lie 
That you're the one for me 
You bring me ecstasy 

[Chorus x2]

Sunshine in my life 
No more stormy days 
Sunshine in my life 
No more stormy days 
Sunshine in my life 
No more stormy days
