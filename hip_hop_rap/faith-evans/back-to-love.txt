You remind me of
Of a love I once knew before
I was so open for love
So in love with no experience
But I like this feeling
You're really bringing back the memories
Of someone I once knew
I feel you bring it all back to me

Bring me back to love
Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could run away
Run away

It was hard to see
All the wrong my last love did to me
I was just a fool in love
That's not how it was supposed to be
But I like this feeling
And I don't want you to remind me of
Of someone I once knew
Just keep on bringing me back to love

Bring me back to love
Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could run away
Run away

You make me feel so good
You treat me like I'm special baby
So take me back to love
Cause that is where I wanna be
Back to love

It's so good it's plain to see
The way that you keep loving me
Bringing back the memories
Of a love that used to be

It's so good it's plain to see
The way that you keep loving me
Bringing back the memories
Of a love that used to be

Bring me back to love
Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could run away
Run away

Bring me back to love
Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could run away
Run away

Bring me back to love
Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could run away
Run away

Bring me back to love
Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could run away
Run away
