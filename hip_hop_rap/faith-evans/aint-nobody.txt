[Chorus]

Ain't nobody who can love me like you 
Ain't no reason that I'll ever be untrue 
There's no need for me to try 
I can't find a reason why 
Ain't nobody who can really love me like you do 

I was always the one who needed some affection 
And you open your heart to me 
Now I'm falling in love 
And I can't get enough of your love 
There ain't no 

[Chorus]

Since you been in my life, now I have direction 
And I know where I want to be 
Boy you know it's with you 
Cause I love what you do when your making sweet love to me 

I thought that I thought I was wrong was wrong 
For wanting to For wanting to be with you all the time all the time 
I never you knew  I never knew that you would play 
games with my mind my mind 

[Chorus]

When you hold me in your arms 
I get this feeling 
Fill me with your love 
Can't nobody love me like you boy 
Cause you give me your good love 
Ain't nobody that can love me like you do 

[Repeat 10x Fade]
