I wanna ask you one thing 
If you would stop to listen 
Tell of a man who loves you 
In spite of what you've done to him 
The only problem is you won't take 
The time to acknowledge 
What he's done for you and me 
Let me refresh your memory 

Chorus
He took off his crown from his head 
And came down from heaven 
He laid down his life in our stead 
Now what is more important? 

I wanna ask you one thing 
If you would stop to listen 
Tell of a man who loves you 
In spite of what you've done to him 
The only problem is you won't take 
The time to acknowledge 
What he's done for you and me 
Let me remind you all he took it off 

Chorus

Bridge
Why don't you give your life to him today 
Please don't you hesitate and don't delay 
Why don't you give to him your life today 
Please don't you hesitate and don't delay 

Chorus
