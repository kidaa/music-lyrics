Ooh Mmm Oh oh, ooh 

Kandi:
I was in misery without you 
I could not imagine life without you 
It was such a painful thing to go through 
Have you being taken away 
But I, I dried my tears 
Even though it took a couple of years 
I guess I had to just get over my fears 
Of being alone 
But it gets... 

Chorus 1 

It gets, it gets easier 
Without you 
I won't feel right 
I can't feel right 
Without you 
But it gets, it gets easier 

Chorus 1 

Faith:
I thought my life was over without you 
Thought I would be oh so sad darling 
'Cause you left me here to face all my fears 
All by myself, with nobody else 
Now that you're gone, I just got to move on 
But my love will never change 
It'll always stay the same 
I felt you were gone, the lonely nights alone 
I get weak, then I'm strong 
It gets easier 

Chorus 1 

Chorus 1 

Kandi:
Sometimes it's really hard to just let go 

Faith:
Don't feel like movin' on, oh, yet I know 

Kandi   Faith: 
Just breathin' air is hard to bare 
When the one that you love is not there 

Faith: 
Thoughts of you sit heavy on my mind 

Kandi: 
I always reminisce on our good times 

Kandi   Faith 
I just take it day by day 
I know that it'll never be easy 
But I can say, it gets easier 


Chorus
