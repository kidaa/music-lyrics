Welcome
We've dedicated our entire album cover
To any person who has ever sent us fan mail
This is a journey into life, love
And the future of music fan mail
TLC would like to thank you 
For your support fan mail
And just like you
They get lonely too

Just like you
I get lonely too
Ahhhhhhhhh fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh fan mail
Just like you
I get lonely too
Ahhhhhhhhh fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh fan mail
Just like you
I get lonely

Waited for you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sittin' Miss alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I got an e-mail today
Kinda thought that you'd forgot about me
So I wanna hit you back to say

[Chorus:]
Just like you
I get lonely baby
I could really get to know you
Take my time to show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely take me
To another place where I'll be
Into space just you and me
With no rules
Just like you
I get lonely too

Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you 
I get lonely too
Ahhhhhhhhh
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you 
I get lonely

Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't want to come on strong
Cuz too many people wanna get me
But a girl will do what I gotta do

[Chorus]

Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh

Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you 
I get lonely too
Ahhhhhhhhh
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh

Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you fan mail
Ahhhhhhhhh 
Just like you 
I get lonely too

Man we had all kinda
Sorts of conflicting fan mail and letters
Some parents was like
You're the thieves and the pimps and the thugs of stage
And you owe every mother in America
A public apology

Just like you
I get lonely too
One day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait till the day I see ya
No doubt you just might be the one for me
I get lonely
Every day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait till the day I see ya
No doubt you just might be the one I need
Just like you

Be me, do what I believe in
And be myself
And I suggest everyone do the same thing
You do what makes you feel comfortable
Do what makes you feel happy
