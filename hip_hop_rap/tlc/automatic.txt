Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo 
Au-to-matic
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo yeah
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo

I remember when I fell for you
It wasn't when I wanted to
But you were acting so into me
Au-to-matic
Think real good for Martha too
Just like every relationship
We gotta earn the trust too
And can't get it baby

I know many start to changed
We could never be the same
I could do it when you do it to me
Au-to-matic
I know if it came to be
We could get a chance to see
A side of each other
That we'd all hidden up

[Chorus:]
What do you do to make me feel 
So good for so long
Then take it back
And expect me to be alone
I can get cold
But if you're gonna do me wrong
I'll get you back
Baby that's just just automatic

I remember when I met
The man with all the confidence
Every day was promises to me
Au-to-matic
Then you step way out of line
Cheat on me too many times
I'm trynna put you down
All that comes around goes back around yeah

I know many start to changed
We could never be the same
I could do it when you do it to me
Au-to-matic
I know if it came to be
We could get a chance to see
A side of each other
That we'd all hidden up

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

That's
Just
Au-to-matic

That's just just automatic
That's just just
That's just just automatic
That's just just oh
That's just just automatic
That's just just
That's just just automatic
That's just just baby

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo 
Au-to-matic
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Baby that's just just automatic

Au-to-matic
Au-to-matic
Au-to-matic
Au-to-matic
Au-to-matic
