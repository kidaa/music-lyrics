Tis the season to be givin' 
And I've got somethin' just for you
Let's take a trip to my cabin
We can celebrate
A funky Christmas made for 2 oh
That's all I want

[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas
Is to be loved by someone like you
Outside the snow is falling
My heart is calling
To spend my Christmas time alone with you
Now throw a log on the fire
Then we could trim the tree
How much fun it would be
To take a walk in the snow
As you're holdin' me close
That would be your Christmas gift to me

[Chorus]

Maybe it ain't got nuttin' to do
With my 2 front teeth
Not unless of course you're lookin'
For some chewed up beef
See I love ya cuz I'm in love
And in love cuz I love ya
These words and sentences is for the heads
Between and above ya
Can you imagine me alone
A dial tone
A two flips cone
The echo of a moan
A single bow
A measley dug it
A pea in the bucket
Flat out for Christmas all I wanna do is yow
Maybe if my baby didn't treat me like a lady
Diss the host for my toast
Kiss the spot that's mostly shady
Twist the left all around
Flips these lips upside down
Then you'll never have to ask me why I'm crazy
So hear me in or hear me out
Give me deaf or give me doubt
Or tell me what it's all about
And if you figure out my flow
Be it fast or be it slow
Me and my baby will be chillin' with the mistletoe

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
