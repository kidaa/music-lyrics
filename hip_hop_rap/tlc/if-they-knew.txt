[Chorus:]
I don't know what 
She would do if she knew
That you were comin'
To do what we do
I don't know what
He would do if he knew
That you were comin'
To do what we do

Always wondered if she knew about us
When I met ya you said ya'll had broke up
Right on time cuz I didn't have my love
Me and him was also messed up
That let me fall to you
And from what I could tell you fell too
And I wonder if it would be wrong
If we just kept it on

And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

[Chorus]

Always thought that he knew about you
When I met you I said we were through
In time my feelings came right back
But I didn't let us get off track
And I got so into you
Went too fast what do I do
When I know I shoulda helped it out
But you just turn me on

And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

[Chorus]

We kept things pretty tight thus far
Love without the sex 
And hundred thousand dollar cars
Ain't it funny how our auras unify
An entity upon itself
That can spread wings and fly
A peaceful coexistance that will surely last
Becomes a reminiscent dream
For those in our past
If they knew just a fraction of all the things we do
They still wouldn't comprehend 
The depth between me and you

And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

[Chorus]

I don't know what 
She would do if she knew
Da da da da da da da da da
I don't know what 
He would do if he knew
I don't know don't know
Don't know

I don't know don't know
Don't know
What's up
What's up
I
