Yo, I'm checkin' for Left Eye man
Oh God 'G'
I don't know God, I don't know God
I don't God, I don't really really know check my flow

My man Al B. Sure 'He's In Effect Mode'
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get wit me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Um, speakin' of which, you know how I troop
Late Thursday night playing ball at run and shoot
I see my girl Chilli in her Lexus Coupe
Sittin' pretty, oohh, in dat hot pink suit
And Bam!
In through the door she struts
It's the lovely T-Boz with the ill haircut
But Left Eye's the dime piece
Yeah, you know it's all good
But I hear, it was a hood

It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Phife from freak
It's like that y'all
My name's Malike the Phife from freak
It's on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E I rule
TLC up in the house
Crazy Sexy Cool

Ya know what I'm sayin'
