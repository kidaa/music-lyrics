Unh, remember me
Well if you don't 
I think after this song
You will

We got tonight all alone baby
No distractions no if and or maybes
Lately we haven't had to time to
Do the things we usually do
I've been thinking bout something 
Real special for you
And I want you to be good to me too 
Yeah

I love it when you touch me
Feelin' so good that it must be 
Right for you to love me
And do all the things that I wanna see
I had a long day and my tension is strong
Need a release baby you turn me on
Whatever you do just don't stop
So oh oh oh

[Chorus:]
So don't go too fast
So don't go fast
Make it a night that I won't forget
Gotta make it last
Gotta make it last
Livin' the love that I haven't seen
Awoke from the past
Woke from the past yeah
Tonight is the night that you won't regret
So baby just don't pull out on me yet

But when you satisfy me
I can tell it when you know my body
Holdin' me closer to you
Ain't gon' wait let me do what I do
See I get a funny feelin'
That makes me wanna share it 
Over and over again

I love it when you touch me
Feelin' so good that it must be 
Right for you to love me
And do all the things that I wanna see
I had a long day had a long day
And my tension is strong tension is strong
Need a release baby you turn me on you turn me on
Whatever you do just don't stop
So oh oh oh 

[Chorus]

Baby baby baby

[Chorus]
