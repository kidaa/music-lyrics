I used to walk around like
Nothing could happen to me
Life is a gamble so I 
Should live life more carefully
But all I know is that I
Control my own destiny
I used to look at others
Instead of me blaming me

[Bridge:]
Don't ask yourself why
Just look to the sky
Believe that soon you'll see the other side

[Chorus:]
I know
That through all the struggle
There's a bright road 
At the end of the tunnel
Now you should know
Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn
Life is worth it
Watch the tables turn

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Whenever you feel troubled
With problems coming your way
Don't ever get discouraged
There's always a better day
We all don't know the answers
Believe and trust when I say
That havin' faith is always
The way to make things okay

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

That's right
Alright

You've had your ups and downs but
It happened for a reason
Cause after April showers
There will come a change of season
So please don't give up now cuz
The sun's shinin' through the clouds
It's gonna be alright
I know

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Watch the tables turn 
Watch the tables turn
Watch the tables turn 
Watch the tables turn
Watch the tables turn 
Watch the tables turn
Watch the tables turn 
Watch the tables turn
