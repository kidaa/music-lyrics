Saw you two the other day
And I must say that she looks great
You all make the cutest two
I guess I should be glad for you
But the thought of you just makes me sick
It's been two weeks and that's too quick
I can't say that I'm doin' fine
Cuz I'm bout to lose my mind
And I don't know what I'll do so

Chorus
Real sad for me too bad for you
That I'm so lonely and confused
I've gotta take it out on you
Cuz you left me for some chick
Now I'm lovesick baby

Saw myself on Ricki Lake
Overweight and full of hate
Some asshole left me in distress
I used to look down on all that mess
Seems like everything just changed
Once I gave my love to you you went away
Since you are the one to blame
You better figure out how to get it back baby

Chorus

Before I met you I didn't think
A man could ever do a thing
To take away my independence baby
Before I met you I was strange
Now I'm bout to go insane
So you better think about it baby
