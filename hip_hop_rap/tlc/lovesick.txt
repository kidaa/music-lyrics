Saw you two the other day
And I would say that she looks great
You all make the cutest two
I guess I should be glad for you
The thought of you just makes me sick
It's been two weeks and that's too quick
I can't say that I'm doin' fine
Cuz I'm bout to lose my mind
And I don't know what I'll do so

[Chorus:]
You're sad for me too bad for you
That I'm so lonely and confused
I've gotta take it out on you
Cuz you left me for some chick
Now I'm lovesick baby

Saw myself on Rikki Lake
Overweight and full of hate
Some asshole left me in distress
I used to look down on all that mess
Seems like everything just changed
Once I gave my love to you you went away
Since you are the one to blame
You better figure out how to get it back baby

[Chorus]

Before I met you I didn't think
That you'd ever do a thing
To take away my independence baby
Before I met you I was straight
Now I'm bout to go insane
I saw you and I think about you baby

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
