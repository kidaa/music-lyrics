Ooohh yeah yeah yeah
If you need a little tenderness
Can't find it no where else
If you want a little something sweet
You just come to me
If you're hungry for some love at night
I'll fix you up just right
There's a tender place just down the way
Where you can stay and I'm singin'

[Chorus:]
Come on down
Where the water tastes sweet
Dive into my ocean
Bring your love to me
Come on down come on down
Where the lovin' feels right
Door is always open
Open all night come down baby
Baby won't you come on down

I can take you where you need to go
Take you there nice and slow
To a place where feelings run so deep
You just run to me
I can lead you to a special kiss
Fulfill your every wish
There's a place I know just down the road
Where you should go and I'm singin'

[Chorus]

Oooooh
I can take you to where the love flows like wine
I can show you my deepest secrets inside
And if you take a chance where I wanna be
So come here and get close 
And baby gimme what I need the most

Come come down
If you need a little tenderness
Can't find it nowhere else
If you want a little something sweet
You just come to me
If you're hungry for some love at night
I'll fix you up just right
There's a tender place just down the way
Where you can stay and I'm singin'

[Chorus]

All you gotta do is come to me
Oh baby baby come down on me
Where the water water tastes so sweet
Just come to me come to me
You're in me
Come on down
