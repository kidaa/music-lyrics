We bring you 3D

I know I've always been down
No matter who else was around
Those crazy things we've been through
Will always make me love you

[Chorus:]
I'll never let you forget me
You know I'm the best girl you've ever seen
Just when you think you'll never see me
I will be
I can bring it to you in 3D

[Chorus]

There's more than one side of me
There's more than one place to see
You made my dreams come true
Nothing could replace you

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Oooh baby yeah baby
I said oooh baby yeah baby
I said oooh baby yeah baby
I said oooh baby yeah baby

Shake 'em up shake 'em up shake 'em out
Shake 'em up shake 'em up shake 'em out
One time for your mind
