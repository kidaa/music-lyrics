U in me feels twice as nice
And everything we do is right 
It's nasty love but that's all right with me
Once a month is not enough
I think about it every week
There's other guys
But that's not U in me

[Chorus:]
I can't understand why it feels so good
I never felt this way before
I want U more and more each day 
Even if there's someone else
I might as well take care of myself
I'm never satisfied like U in me
You're so damn special baby yeah
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
You're so damn special
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me

U in me became unreal
I never hesitate to see
I need it now and that's how it should be
U in me was somethin' else
Started messin' with my mind
Cuz there will never be me in U hey hey

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special yeah
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
You're so damn special, U know, U know, U know baby
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special

Can't understand the way I feel 
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
You're so damn special baby
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special hey hey hey yeah 
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
So damn special hey oh oh
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special hey yeah hey yeah
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
So damn special baby 
So damn special
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special baby hey
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
