Switch switch switch switch
I ain't one to be questioned
About who and where I've been
I ain't one to be questioned
About what time I came in
Tryna squeeze, baby please
Hit the road and don't come back
'Cause I can't trust a relationship
Wit no trust and that's a fact

[Chorus]
Switch
Don't take no mess from nobody
Switch
If they act up just leave 'em alone
Switch
Don't take no mess from nobody
Switch
When ya done wit 'em you can send 'em home

I won't answer to no one
Until I feel I'm ready to
I'm gonna have my fun
Doin' the things I like to do
See I need space get off my case
Stop breathin' down my back
Cause we ain't gotta relationship If that's how you have to act

Commitment true devotion
Right now is not the way
For you to come at me
When I need it
I'm sure you'll be the first to know
But for now, in my plnas, no demands
I'm gonna have to make a switch

Switch
Throw his behind in a ditch
While my definition states as it relates
To us mates, one eliminates
Solely contemplates n' de associates
Like my new drink was V-8's
Just as quick as I get in it
I'll drop 'em in a minute
Like the dollaz
In my pocket, Speedy Gonzalez
Couldn't stop the way I spin it
I'm known for breakin' every speed limit
This switch could be infinite
I said L to da E to da F to the T to da E to the Y
Because I'm so fly
Bring it back to the E so come and see me
At the hotel motel Holiday Inn
I said if you man starts actin' upu
Switch and take his friend

Erase replace embrace new face come on
Erase replace embrace new face

[Chorus]
