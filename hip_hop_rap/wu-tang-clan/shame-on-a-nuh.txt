Razor sharp, I sever the head from the shoulders,

Yo...!

Style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals
I'm no joker!  Play me as a joke,
I be on you like a house on fire!  Smoke ya!
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway,
Be like, "Warriors! Come out & playiyay!"
Hurry, I gettin it on, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keeps the nuff stains my drawers
So I can gete Fizzy-funky for YUH!
Murder, takes the fame of the Wu-Tang RAHH!
Here comes the Tiger verse Crane!
Ow, be like wild with my style
Punk! You playing me, chump, you get DUMPED!

And get funk like a SHOE!
What!
