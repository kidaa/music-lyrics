Babyface and L.A. Reid
You've got that look in your eyes
And I've got plans for 2
though you're the kinda girl
Who likes to take her time with love
I'd gladly wait forever for you
But in the middle of the night***
I know something ain't right
We've got something special girl
Let's give it a try
1 night of touchin**
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
makes 1 night of love
1 night of touchin**
2 nights of trust
3 night of huggin
makes 1 night of love
You've got that love in your heart
And I've got love for you
But I'm the kinda guy
Who likes to get right to the point
I wanna give my lovin to you
So in the middle of the night
When I'm holdin you tight
I'll show you how precious lovers
Love thru the night
Repeat Chorus** 2x
Repeat Chorus***
1 night
of love
you know you owe it to me
just 1
tender touch of loving
and holding
Gimmie your loving
1 night
of love
you know you owe it to me
just 1
tender touch of loving
and holding
Gimmie your loving
Repeat chorus**
