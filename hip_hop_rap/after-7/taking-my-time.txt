You blow my mind, with the things you do to me
girlie I can't resist your luscious lips caressing my body
How do you keep not from fallin
fallin in love, with a girl that can do you
the way you like to be done
You blow my mind with the things you do to me girlie I cant resist your
luscious lips caressing my body
Takin my time with you girl
never know when we'll do this again
takin my time with you girl, 
touchin your love stokin you from within hook
I hear your voice callin
baby please pick up the phone
But I dont wanna answer
I got too many women
so I'm tellin you not to fall in love with me
Repeat Hook 3X
The time is right for you to be
close to me
indefinately
they say good things come to those
who wait I need to hold you in my arms
