I don't eat red meat but I'm not a vegetarian
I like ice cream/ but not much dairy 
'cause it gets in my nose
it makes me gotta blows
snot like a farmer and it gets on my clothes 
it's rather unsightly/ can even be frightening 
but cold medication/ should not be taken nightly
because everything dat I put in/ it comes out again
and if I eat lean/ it helps me stay thin 
check out my hair, I keep it dreaded
about my corn? I like it breaded 
hot from the oven? MMMM! you said it!
straight to the stomach my fuel is unleaded
But not fossil fuels/ I like olive oil 
I like my eggs scrambled/ I never eat 'em boiled
The way to my heart/ is with a garlic clove 
it smells hella sexy/ when it's on the kitchen stove

chorus
Red beans and rice, red beans and rice, red beans and rice, 
make everything nice 
red beans and rice, red beans and rice, red beans and rice 
I could eat a plate twice. So nice. So nice. So nice.

Most people on the planet/ eat beans and rice
some can't afford beef or they think cows are nice 
If you talk table manners don't believe all they
told ya I eat with my fingers like an African soldier
I don't know which fork is for meat or for salad
I haven't got a clue when they say ";whet your palate";
eat a lot a prunes it'll keep you loose
skin'll turn orange if you drink carrot juice
I think beef jerky tastes like a boot
when I'm on the street I chew a licorice root
and if I have a soar throat /then I eat ginger
and I will break bread /with those who are strangers
so come into my cave / tonight I will show you
food is for life / and life I will show you. 
If you're havin' problems/ I invite you here 
step into my kitchen /we will cook away your fears

chorus

Amazing grace how sweet the sound that 
saved a wretch like me 
Dammit let's eat!
Mi casa es su casa. Mi cocina es su cocina.
you know what I meana! 

bridge
get some boilin' water! Yeah!
get a pound aof beans! Yeah! 
get some spice and make it nice! Yeah! 
you know what I mean!

But if a friend has gas /then he's passin' 
it gives me a headache end I gotta take aspirin
it makes me dizzy/ I fix him fizzies 
to calm his stomach/ when it's feelin kinda
busy some like it white/but I like it brown 
I like spicy chicken/ and I can throw it down
chilis come red /and chilis come green 
when it's on the table/ I lick my plate clean
Then I drink a toast to the host and hostess
But first we give thanks/ to God the Mostest
'cause if I am a guest/ I always wash my plate
sip a sip a soda while I sing Amazing Grace
rings on my fingers /left round the tub
bass fulla bubbles/ bumpin like a wash tub
think about my troubles/ goin down the drain
dryin' up the puddles in the back of my brain
But...
