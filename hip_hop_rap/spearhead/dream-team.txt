Red Black Green, Red Gold Green
Dat's how we know we a fe we dream team 
repeat

The other day
A friend gave me a call
He said that the dream team was playin basketball
Was so excited / That I hadda get a Witness
The first time the NBA was in the 'lympics
players from the east/ players from the west 
And you can bet that they took the very best
";Except they left Tim Hardaway at home"; 
";Yeah that was hella fucked up!"; 
But Anyway
I tuned in because I was hella psyched
To see Magic Johnson on the same team as Mike

Gettin crazy / Havin lots of fun 
makin sure that they got the job done 
Fans were wavin the red white end blue
It seemed strange to me / was it strange to you? 
Brotha's on the street / And everyone is scared a ya 
So how could ten Africans represent America?
Bullshit / It didn't mean a thing
'Cause in the same year / we saw Rodney King 
So I thought / That I would put a team together
A team that I have been waitin for forever 
Some a you / May know what I mean 
But if you don't then / Lemme introduce you to... 
MY DREAM TEAM! 
";SPEARHEAD IN THE AREA!";

chorus 
THIS IS MY DREAM TEAM, MY DREAM TEAM 
MY DREAM TEAM, MY DREAM TEAM 

Well Chuck D'sannouncin'/ Flava's doin' color
halftime enterntainment by Dre and Ed Lover
Malcolm X is the coach he's drawin' up the strategy
he's choppin up America's anatomy
'cause they're the ones/ we're up against of course 
are general manager is Chief Crazy Horse 
Huey Newton/ 'cause he was extra hard
he's the one/ who would be playin at the shootin' guard
I dreamed Charles Barkley would be 
played by Marcus Garvey
he'd be throwin people off his back and makin 
sure they never got a rebound rebound / and
he'd throw it to the outlet
Nat Turner/ 'cause he can turn the corner when
he's out there
he be flyin through the air/ throwin passes like
he really doesn't care/behind the back /and in
between the legs
he's handlin the rock /as gently as an egg
he's throwin it in/ to Angela Davis's neighborhood 
she's postin up down in the extra hard wood
she grabs the pill/ and then she puts her shoulder down
get out the way/ 'cause she's gonna throw down now
boom /oh my god! I just can't believe it
get anotha backboard or bettah yet leave it. 
we always play for fun /but we always play for keeps 
the game is over and the loser's gotta sweep.
up the glass/ that we busted in the ass 
Set the record straight /about America's past
THIS IS MY DREAM TEAM
";SPEARHEAD IN THE AREA!"; 

chorus 
DREAM TEAM'S IN THE HOUSE 
DREAM TEAM'S IN THE HOUSE 

Well after doin that /we be headin for the ceremony 
hand on the heart /is a bunch of baloney
the spirit of/ the '68 olympics
Black power people/ can I get a witness
fist in the air/ this is proper manners
while Jimi Hendrix/ is fuckin' up the spangled banner
up into the sky/ Miles Davis blows a horn 
Look into the bleachers/ It's Bill Clinton sellin popcorn
so now we jump! and we have a celebration! 
Shaquille 0'neal would provide the entertainment
to some of you this is a far fetched scheme
but to me... I'll tell you what it is...
This is my Dream Team...
";spearhead in the area";

chorus

Yeah Sista Rosa Perks she gets the first seat
on the bench!
and Dr. King, webring him in in a pinch.

Because I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
Beceuse I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
Because I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
Because I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
