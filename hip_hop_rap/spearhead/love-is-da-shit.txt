Say when you called me that night
to tell me that things
they weren't goin' alright with your boyfriend
was it me or did you just need somebody to talk to
Say is it you or the fact that I can't be near you
that keeps you in the front of my mind
when your breath is the last thing that you say
when your voice goes away                      
and a breath is the last thing that you say

But the warmth of your lips on my fingertips won't go away
when I drop my head in my hands and play
the memory of that might in L.A.
again and again and again
because I can't think straight and I can't sleep late
the few times we shared I try to recreate
I know this is wrong better stop this talk
cause grass can grow up through a crack in the sidewalk
and what I see when I look in your eyes
grass that's truly greenest sprouting inside
I wasn't even looking when I realized
that you had the vibe that was my fertilizer
thought love in this world was dead and buried and gone
how could I be so cynical when I was so young
you hit me in the chest like and 808 boom
I found love is the shit that makes life bloom!

chorus

Love is the shit that makes life bloom
and you never know when you might step in it!
love is the shit that makes life bloom
and you never know when you might...

But fate is like a pigeon that follows me around
sometimes he flies ahead and he brings me what he found
then he'll drop it on my head leave me numb
from the brain down
that's the way it was when I walked upon your ground

The irrepressible and impermissable
are the two things that have made my life miserable
'cause spirits don't leave if you don't talk about 'em
and memories come back when you don't think aabout 'em
I wish I had an ocean of some magic potion
I'd trade all this emotion for a few moments of motion
I've never felt this way some things can't be rehearsed
now I'm grindin' up my gearbox tryin' to find reverse
because...

chorus

bridge
But I want to keep on walkin'
Right through
And let this fellin' rock me
ooh-oooh!
repeat
";ya know fallin' in love is like easing into a hot tub.
it feels good on your feet but by the time you
get to your mid section you know your either
gonna get all the way in or all the way out!";

But music brings me comfort in this grieving hour
the Sade tape tells me it's all over for now
I listen read hard but don't dare play it loud
'cause I don't wanna think what you might be doin' now
sometimes it feels like a bad initiation but you
woke my hear from a long hibernation
you were worth every risk so I gave my hear room
and now I'm deep in the doo-doo
that makes life bloom
because...

chorus

bridge
See the flowers bloomin' in the springtime
see the bees zoomin' in the sunshine
repeat
