Every woman every man wanna move dem feet 
every woman every man love a Spearhead beat! 

Police in the city 
is shuttin all the clubs down
it's lookin like a ghost town
ya know Mary- what we gotta do? 
Hell Yeah! 
we gotta go underground"; 
To da place -from which we all came from 
house parties-they was always fun
remember tryin to rig a sound system 
everybody- would bring a donation
when we needed- to get a turn table
my man Zulu
would borrow one from aunt Mable 
set it up in the corner-
turn the lights down until the mornin' 

chorus
But the party ain't started till the speaker's blown 
NO! NO! NO!
Run fa ya life!
The party ain't started 'till the speaker's blown

While he was settin up camp 
someone else would bring a home stereo amp 
with a note from they mama-
";don't turn it up loud or it's a goner"; 
sorry mama- there's no chance
cause if the shit ain't bumpin'
people ain't gonna dance
";know what I'm sayin'"; ";Turn that shit up";
everybody in the place would bring a few speakers 
string em all togetha like they was sneakers 
and say a prayer- before we turn it on 
hopin that the amp- wouldn't get blown.
I asked Mary watcha think of it
";now we need a D.J. to work this shit"; 
so everybody- would bring a few singles- get 
the beat bumpin
and then start to mingle chorus
Every woman every man wanna move dem feet 
every woman every man love a Spearhead beat!

Every brother and every sister
would pay respect up to the ancestors
we would dance and we would celebrate
even though we live in a police state
then the pigs- would try to make a statement
with a ticket- for noise abatement 
but we kept it pumpin' -till the braekadawn
then we told the cops
they gotta break the door down 
and today -across the nation- don't ya know
it's the same situation
alotta cities lookin like a ghost town 
but the house party will never be shut down
no no no!

chorus
Every woman every man wanna move dem feet
every woman every man love a Spearhead beat!
repeat
