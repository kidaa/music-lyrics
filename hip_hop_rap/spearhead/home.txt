If you are hungry I will 
bake some bread for you 
If you are worried I will 
hold your head for you 

If you can't sleep at night I will 
screen your dreams for you 

And if you feel uptight I will 
make everything alright for you. 

If the key don't work / knock on the door
If the key don't work / knock on the door
no matter how far away you seem I am always
here at home
