[Erick Sermon]
here we go cruisin, me and my boys rollin four deep
in the A-U streets, seein who we can meet
Beep beep, a crew of girls in their green Cherokee
Screamin, ";That's Erick G,"; my boys gettin happy B
Err, ERRR, the girls made a U-turn
Pulled up beside me, tires smellin burned yea yea
I scoped the whole car yo before I spoke
to see which one was dope before I start actin loc
That's crazy, ";How you doin baby?  The one
with the daisies, short top with the paisleys
What's your name?  Oh they call you Lucky?";
Had Child's Play on my mind but none of us was Chucky
";So what are you doin?  Follow me to my crib";
I had the girls trailin, had my system wailin boom boom
Drove off, and my boys screamin loud
Happy for the hoes because they wasn't crows word me up
We argued, on who gets who
The first pick is mine, respect from my crew
I took the freaky deaky one who was drivin
She looked like she was widdit, I definitely want to hit it
word em up Jeff screamed, ";We're goin out for the cause
and when we get there, we're goin straight for the drawers";
Dude - they was bangin, I must try not to keep them hangin
Yeah - but I find myself singin

Nobody knows, but my face expression shows yea yea
I was wide open, man I couldn't believe it
If the girl asked me for my truck, I swear she can keep it

The ones who was trailin me, goin in the Cherokee
But fuck em, I didn't care anymore
