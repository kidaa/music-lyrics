[Chris:]
Weak
I have been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I can barely speak
Barely eat
On my knees

[Keri:]
But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible I see
Through the me
I used to be

[Chorus:]
[Chris:]
You changed my whole life
[Keri:]
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
[Chris:]
I'm feeling all Super human
You did that to me
Super human heart beats in me
[Both:]
Nothing can stop me here with you, superhuman
Super human
[Chris:]
Super human
[Keri:]
Super human

[Chris:]
Strong
Since I've been flying and righting the wrongs
Feels almost like i had it all along
I can see tomorrow
[Keri:]
But every problem is gone because
I flew everywhere with love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see
How love could set me free

[Chorus:]
[Both:]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all Super human
You did that to me
Super human heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you, superhuman
Super human
[Chris:]
Super human

[Chris:]
Its not a bird
Not a plane

[Both:]
Its my heart and its gonna go away

[Both:]
My only weakness is you
Only reason is you
Every minute with you I feel like I can do
Anything

[Chorus:]
[Both:]
Going going I'm going away
In love
You changed my whole life
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all Super human
You did that to me
Super human heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you, superhuman
Super human
[Chris:]
Super human
