[Verse 1]
If I could, take a trip, to outer space
She would be the one, I will see
When I get, to heavens gate
She would welcome me with her arms, open wide, and a smile
Will shadow me brighter than the sun
She hasnt had a fair chance, so Ill give her one
Let me tell you who she is, yeah

[Chorus]
Shes a fallen angel, sent from heaven up above
Shes a fallen angel, waitin for me to love her, yeah
Know that shes  Shes a fallen angel, take your judgment off her
I know, that shes a fallen angel

[Verse 2]
You know, I could
Help her mend, her broken wings
So she can fly again
But I dont,  wanna lose everything that Ive gained
Turnin me a selfish man oh

I couldnt take the pain, from watchin her fly away
So say that youll stay
