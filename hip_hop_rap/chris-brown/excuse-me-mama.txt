Oh Wa Oh Aww Yea aww yea

I was at the mall on some back to school
Tryna cop me a couple pairs of shoes
And then I looked to my left and I lost my breath cause this girl was sooo fresh
I really wasn't tryna intrude
But she looked like the type I was into
And I wanted to holla but she was wit her mama
Felt like a catch twenty two

[hook]
Man I shoulda stepped to her
I shoulda stepped to her
Not any disrespect to her
But I thought she would like if I kept it polite
So I stepped and this what I said to her

[chorus]
Excuse me mama
Hey
Your daughters fine [x2]
And if I could I'd like a moment of her time
a moment of her time
While I was shopping I saw her walking by
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine

Wishing I could catch her by herself
Waiting till she wasn't with nobody else
But everytime I saw her I would try to call her
But she was busy checking for the sales
Part of me was like just let it go 

Another part of me was like just let her know
But I would never get this chance in my life so I have to man up and tell her so

[hook]
I shoulda stepped to her [x2]
So I stepped and this is what I said

[chorus]
Excuse me mama
hey 
your daughters fine
so fine so fine
And if I could I'd like a moment of her time
While I was shopping I saw her walking by 
walking by
So can I get her number and I'll give her miiinnnne

Baby don't you know that you got me up in the wrong store
And now the mall is about to close
Crazy but I followed you
I just couldn't take it no more
No disrespect to your mama but i need that numer baaabbbyyyy

[chorus]
Excuse me Mama
Hey
Your daughter's fine 
And if i could I'd like a moment of her time
While I was shopping I saw her walking by
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine

[repeat chorus x2]
