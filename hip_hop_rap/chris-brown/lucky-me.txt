[Verse 1] 
Lights on, stage set. 
I guess I gotta put on a show in cos everyones waiting 
?? 
When I turn the radio on I hear all my songs playing yeah 
Whatever money can buy 
I probably got it thats real talk, yeah 
I see my name in the sky all over the world 
And I just sit hear saying 
Lucky me. 

[Chorus] 
I gotta pose for the cameras 
Even when my world's falling down 
I still wear a smile 
Lucky me 
Even though im so damaged 
I gotta pick myself up and peform for the crowd 
Lucky me 
Creating all my loved ones, wannabe a star 
Cos nobodie said it would be so hard 
Wouldent put this on no-one yeah 
Lucky me. 

[Verse 2] 
So exclusive 
I dont have to wait in the line 
Its like the club is mine now 
If it was only that simple 
Everyone says it easy to do 
Well we know, thats not true 
Whatever money can buy 
I probably got it thats real talk, yeah 
I see my name in the sky all over the world 
And I just sit hear saying 
Lucky me. 

[Chorus] 
I gotta pose for the cameras 
Even when my world's falling down 
I still wear a smile 
Lucky me 
Even though im so damaged 
I gotta pick myself up and peform for the crowd 
Lucky me 
Creating all my loved ones, wannabe a star 
Cos nobodie said it would be so hard 
Wouldent put this on no-one yeah 
Lucky me. 

[Verse 3] 
My dream and its my heart 
The life of being a star 
You dont even know how hard it is, do you yeah 
Now im thankfully for everything 
And im finally becoming a man 
Now I gotta pick a show to do 
Lucky me. 

[Chorus] 
I gotta pose for the cameras 
Even when my world's falling down

Lucky me 
Creating all my loved ones, wannabe a star 
Cos nobodie said it would be so hard 
I wouldent put this on no-one else.
