[Verse 1] 
Theres a star in the palm of my hands 
And I think it shows 
You dont want me 
Then I'll understand 
You deserve much more 
When I brought it 
Down from the sky, you almost forgot it 
It was new back when you gave a dam 
If you need it I'll go and get it. 

[Chorus] 
But if I dont come back 
Girl your love was worth it 
Thats the one thing I'll know 
And if I dont make it back 
Girl remember that 
That I said I'd go baby 
Girl your love is so hard 
But it takes me so far 
But I dont care, I'll go 
If I dont make it home 
But atleast now you know 
Girl for you, I'll go. 

[Verse 2] 
Got my heart in the palm of your hands 
Now you sure thats yours 
If you dont want it 
I wont understand 
Cos I came so far 
When you tossed it 
It took forever to find the place where you lost it 
Now your gone with my heart out the door 
Well its here girl 
Dont forget it. 

[Chorus] 
But if you dont come back 
Girl your love was worth it 
Thats the one thing I know 
If you dont make it back 
Girl remember that 
That I said I'll go for you 
Girl remember that 
That I said I'd go baby 
Girl your love is so hard 
And it takes me so far 
But I dont care, I'll go 
If I dont make it home 
But atleast now you know, I'll go.
