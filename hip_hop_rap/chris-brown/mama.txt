[Verse 1]
I remember Saturday mornins 
Me wakin up to mama in the kitchen cookin and spam cookin
I was just a young dude, watchin mornin cartoons, waitin for mama to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done, cause shed braid it too tight
My mama always gave a style she knew I would like, and then
I would go outside and play, shed sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball

[Bridge]
Mama always did little things like that
Mama always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do
Mama I dedicate this one to you

[Chorus]
Its straight from the heart
This is your song
Youre my lucky charm so you already know,
That Ima sing this one for you, so let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
Youre my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Mama Ima sing this one to you, mama let me sing this one to you

[Verse 2]
Shes like the mother of Tappahannock, VA
Everybody knew miss Joyce, where we stayed
All heads said she was cool, nothing that she wouldnt do
But about CB, she was know to act a fool whoawhoa
With the little money that she made
She took the bed and made it all okay
Nights wit the dickies, when we had to stay there 
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now
