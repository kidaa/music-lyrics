Uh... Mr. West is in the building

Call the shrink up, they about to go crazy
Hold your drinks up, like you was celebrating
Hold your guns, if they is hella hating

I can see them through the lense of my rabie
And wait fast...Mmm
Yeah do you play fair? Mmm

Seen you somewhere before, you look familiar
You had a red shirt, Gucci Slacks, and a Gucci bag to match it
Tell me you remember that baby girl, but lady never mind that
