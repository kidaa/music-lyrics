Hey [x3]

[Intro - Lil Mama]
The way we get loose we move our shoulders, forward, heads, back,
Get it in control like Janet jack,
Get it on the floor let 'em know what's happenin',

[Verse 1 Lil Mama]
Hold up you better ask somebody,
Hoppin' on my grind since butt touch potty,
Y'all don't really want it but the young got time,
With a flow so spec like....
It's so sick, how the clock go tick,
Keep giving y'all hits like...
Uh, 'cause the reason why I spit it, how I spit it, when I spit it,
It's like mucus, gotta get rid of it,
These chicks don't pop like me,
Incompatible girl no comparing me,
And ain't none of y'all scaring me,
Like don't you wish you girl was as bad as me,
With a flow so sick like twisters,
So sweet with the beat cold like a mistake,
Instincts come so smooth like what is it,
Bk h-dub...

[Chorus Chris Brown:]
Shawty get loose, baby do what you do, let me see you let down your hair,
Shawty get loose, hit the dance floor and act like there's nobody else in hurr,
Shawty get loose, crump, clown, break it on down, baby do your thing,
Shawty get loose, p-h-a-t phat, baby I ain't even know you could break it down like that!

[Hook]
That [x8] Shawty Get Loose
That [x8] Shawty Get Loose

[Verse 2 T-Pain]
What it do, tell it to the pizzain,
You already know, tell 'em I'm the mizzain,
Shawty you ain't messin' with a lezzain,
I'm gonna have you loose on the floor you gonna be steppin' with a cazzain,
I mind boggle models, with a bottle of something good,
I take 'em to the hood and have they ass going insane,
A hard rapper artist that hang with singers,
So don't think dis thing hard, cause homie it ain't,
I'm loose loose,
You gotta be kidding me, you tellin' me shawty right here can take her hair down and do it like you, you, you
If all of this is true, you gotta show me what you done told me, now do it
5 4 3 2 2,
You know pain came to change the game all the way from the same thing it's some of that,
New new,
Impress me,
I want person on the floor to come test me,

[Chorus Chris Brown]

[Hook Chris Brown, Lil Mama]
That in the crib, in the club, to the block, it don't matter, it, it don't, it, it don't matter [x8] shawty get loose
That in the crib, in the club, to the block, it don't matter, it, it don't, it, it don't matter [x8] shawty get loose

[Verse 3, Bridge Lil Mama]
In the crib, in the club, to the block, it don't matter, is pit 7, 4 5 6, a doo doo dadda,
How she do do do a that like that,
Got the hood on the back, and the pockets are stacked,
Still rolling, rolling left right,
Shot calling calling that's right,
With my team on the mic, to make it
Bout to pop it, stop drop and roll like a hip-hop rock show,
You never know where my mind gonna go,
Not puerto rican but I like mango,
So smooth on the dance floor
Move on the dance floor
When you see me coming
I'm running it like a game show
You ain't no little mama go
She be burning and pumping and hit you with the bus flow
She's hot then get loose on the floor when I cannot stop!

[Chorus Chris Brown]

[Hook Chris Brown]
