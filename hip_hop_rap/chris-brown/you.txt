You you you you you
You you you you you
You you you you you
You you...you you you

[Verse 1]
Hey mama have you seen a chic
Whos body's 'bout as good as it gets
Oh yeah this cutie was thick
I ain't never seen a girl like this
With so much class and so much hips
Got me feeling right
And I ain't worried about the things she do
Cuz she the type that don't need a crew
And I can tell it by the way she smiles
Swagga's bad, can't be mad
Let's get close tonight

[Chorus]
The craziest body
Exotic little mami
She got curves in the back
Sexy eyes to match
What's missing with that?
Her smile lights up the room
And she ain't got no attitude
I wouldn't say if it wasn't true
I'm talking about you

[Verse 2]
So baby now you know the deal
Don't be frontin tell a nigga what's real
Come on baby tell me how you feel
Cause the temperature's rising
Getting excited
Oh mama I'm getting ready to jump up on it
Don't get it twisted cuz babygirl you know I want it
And I know you really wanna be my woman
Girl, I'm talking about you 

[Chorus x2]
The craziest body
Exotic little mami
She got curves in the back
Sexy eyes to match
What's missing with that?
Her smile lights up the room
And she ain't got no attitude
I wouldn't say if it wasn't true
I'm talking about you

[Outro x2]
You you you you you
you you you you you
you you you you you
you you...
I'm talking about you

[Chorus till fade]
