The Meanest The Meaner The Second i seen her

And I know Its not Likely That You Gonna Deny Me And Just Walk Away

The Ballers In The corner are Ready For Ya Game 
Its lookin Like dem Nokkers Are Ready For My Chain 
She Be That Girl I'll Be Watin For
Sending me dem Signals That I Can't Ignore 
But I Was gonna Get Her On The Dancefloor 
Then I Saw Her Head To The Exit Door

[Chorus]
Call Her Nice Cause She Got It, 
Do It Whatever Whenever Cause She Bout It
