[Puff Daddy]
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil -- for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You annoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggaz in my faction so black askin questions
Strictly gun testin, coke measurin
Givin pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like kites
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your pillow sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
MWA, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and if they fall draw
There's my pilot, he steals my liv, gets my div
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin
The kids to Don, everybody buyin -- no lyin
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, with sporated style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody til somebody kills you

[chorus]
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
I don't wanna die, God tell me why
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you
I don't wanna die, God tell me why

Uhh, uhh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
to make the richest enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
live happily, ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do
but tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed
Incidents like this I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy huh
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin
buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin Cristal
til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, death to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminesce on dead friends too
You're nobody til somebody kills you

[chorus 2X]

Uhh, uhh
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he, used to push the champagne Range I remember that
Silly cat, more sway than the rain
Sways with the G'n game, had the country framed
before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name, wasn't he that kid
that nearly lost half his brain over two grams of cocaine
Gettin his dick sucked by Crackhead Corainne
A puff of shame, dude's the lame, what's his name
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean

[chorus 2X fades]
