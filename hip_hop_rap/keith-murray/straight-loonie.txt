[Erick Sermon doing an Onyx voice]
Testin one two three!  Whoa I flow rhymes wicked
And bust some to keep me uplifted
It flows to my braincells like from smoke
I'm no joke, I make an old man croak because I'm loc'
I'm wild, psychosomatic, I got gats
stored in my attic, for any crazy bastard
It's all in the mind, when the E drops a rhyme
My freakin frame is like a pair of Calvin Klein's
I drop flows through Customs, and get sniffed out
like I stole somethin when I'm bustin
I'm Don of mic with this shit
I rock on, to the breaker one-nine ya dig??
Erick Sermon got funk for days, for those who wanna
backstab me in the back, like the O'Jays!
Can't get these nuts on the real
It's gonna be a cold day in Hell before the E drops the steel!
ARRRRRRRRGH!  I still rock with My Adidas
with Run-D.M.C. and Jay, my niggaz packin heaters
So get off, get off, and if you want the real scoop
on the E Double, check the sounds!
I rise my eyes burnt like cherry
Get wise to my style more fly than Halle Berry
I don't know so I'm sayin bye-bye..
.. until next try!!

[Keith Murray]
And Jesus is a fuckin puppeteer! The devil cut my
sights off, and I'm runnin wild in this atmosphere
For mad niggaz it's curtains
I'm losin my mind, in this biological universe
In my dreams, I'll be gettin away drivin a hearse
So when I get to hell, I'm stabbin up the devil first
and leavin the skull decapitate his ass, catchin wreck
Rip off his head, and shit down his fuckin neck bitch!
From the little voice in my concious
I might just leave a crazy-ass unconcious
And Y, is a crooked letter like my alibi
A psychic couldn't tell the science of my mind
This man gets the wealth and y'all can all eat shit and die
Cause I'ma gets mines, bitch!

Any motherfucker step I dump him in the ditch
