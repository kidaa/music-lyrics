But am I over ya head
Am I over ya head
But am I over ya head
Yo am I over ya head
But am I over ya head
Am I over ya head
Well am I over ya head
Yo am I over ya head

Huh  What  Where  Who
What  Whattyathinkinabout
when who says what when how
You can't maybe follow my style
You be the child, I be the teacher
Smile, who said when, what
mouth not shut, what
Whenever however whenever
whatever the cut
How you maybe could you ever
believe, that you could so quickly achieve
these crafts, please laugh at his stupid ass
upon your knees in glass
You lust, for everything but trust
So we bust back, with conciously charged art
with a mic instead of a brush

But am I over ya head
Am I over ya head
But am I over ya head
Yo am I over ya head
Am I over ya head
Yo am I over your head
Yo am I over ya head
Listen..

Yes, us must trust us, who  Us must trust
not fuss with us, us must trust us discuss trusting us
Us must trust us, who  Us must trust
not fuss with us, us must trust us discuss thus trusting us
Trusting us, us must trust discuss
Discuss not trusting us must not fuss
Us with us means us discussing trusting us
Us must trust us, who  Us must trust
not fuss with us, us must dicuss trusting us

But am I over ya head
Yo am I over your head
But am I over ya head
