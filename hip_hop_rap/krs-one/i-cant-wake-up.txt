Chorus
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

Verse
I'm dreaming about being a blunt
I'm running around and I just can't wake up, Hah!
I'm dreaming about being a blunt. Ho!
I'm walking around and I just cant wake up.

I'm tryin to wake up, I cant wake up
So I run and jump
someone yelled get that blunt.
Get that blunt, now Im thinking this is major
I've got a bunch of people chasing me with a razor
I dont like this dream as a blunt
But I can't get out of it
And I cant seem to wake up
So Im running and racing
Blunt smokers are chasing
This is insane, I'm caught by House Of Pain
I'm picked up
they said they gonna put my head out
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and rewet me
Check it out now, in the same attire
here comes the fire
Now they lit it, now Im burning by the minute
But check it out
more heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull
lungs are full, who's next
I'm being passed to Das Efx
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smokey but I can still see Black Sheep
Woe! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, Im passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
he said,  Me no folllow no rumor 
and passed me to Grand Puba
I wasnt burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said who rolled this
and passed me to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said  I wont front
pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt 
Redman said no need to re-roll
and passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
now they're buggin cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice
he got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm a blunt being smoked and I can't wake up

Chorus

Verse
Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and Im still being smoked up
half my body is gone, now they're coming to my head
now my head is being pinched by Ted-D-Ted
A crazy nightmare i got to go
I got to wake up and Im passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didnt smoke
She passed me off to Showbiz and A.G.
A.G. said respect due see
he got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B.
Smooth B. although he's talking to Ted-D
took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said Yo! There's nothing left Pop
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said  Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill 
Im in the mouth yo! I cant wake up
Yo! Im a blunt getting smoked and I can't wake up

Chorus
