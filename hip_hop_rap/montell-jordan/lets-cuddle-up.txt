[Intro]
Tonight
It's me and you babe  
Lockdown, sing it for me  

1 - 	Let's cuddle up  
	I'll wrap my arms around your waist  
	And lie down naked by the fireplace  
	On a bearskin rug  
	We can make sweet love  

	And then snuggle up  
	We don't need no sheets tonight  
	Just your body laying next to mine  
	Is that all right  
	Lady, let's cuddle up  

I wanna feel your body from head to toe  
Give you everything you've been waiting on  
And you won't be disappointed, wait and see, Oh girl  
Cuz we can make tonight so beautiful  
Make the love we share more meaningful  
Make our bodies fit together perfectly, Oh when we  

Repeat 1  

Your eyes are telling me where your mind is at  
Later on you know we gon' handle that  
With the flames surrounding your silhouette  
Here by my fire mmm  
I'm gonna take my time and finish this  
Kiss the spot on your thigh where you ticklish  
Exploring all of the secret places you want me to find  
So this time  

Repeat 1  

Holding you, kissing you, caressing you, feeling you  
Touching you and holding you, loving you, loving you  
Kissing you, feeling you, massaging you  
La la la la, oh  

Repeat 1  

I just wanna hold you  
I wanna lay you down  
I just wanna be with you  
Lying next to you  
All night all night  
Is all I wanna do  

I just wanna hold you  
I just wanna be with you  
By the fireplace  
On a bearskin rug  
Hold you and  
Baby, lets cuddle up
