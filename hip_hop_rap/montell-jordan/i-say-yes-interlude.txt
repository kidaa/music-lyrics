I would like to take just one moment 
To share with you in song 
A message of thanks 

Because if I don't say thank you 
To the person, the one who gave me 
This gift of music to share with you 
It can all be taken away 
In the twinkling of an eye 

So just take a moment 
With me to say yes 

When it feels like I can't go on 
I'll just say yes I'll say yes 
When the world says no 
You'll still hear Montell when he says 
I'll say yes 
When I'm talked about, lied on, and criticized 
I'll say yes 
Even then He'll make everything alright, alright 
I'll say yes 
I'm gonna testify 
All my life, everyday 
Thank you, Jesus 
I'll say yes oooh 

I'll say yes to you 
Say yes 
Storm and rain, we all say yes 
Heartache and pain, oh I'll say yes 
Every day, all say yes
