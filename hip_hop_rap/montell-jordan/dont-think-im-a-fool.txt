You can call me crazy 
Looks like you're tryin' to play me 
But this here ain't gravy, lady 
I knew about your game from day one 
Don't sit there tryin' to play dumb 
It's time for me to say somethin' 
It's a quarter after 8 hon 
And in a minute you'll be out front 
Waitin' for a cab with your bags 
Here's a quarter, you can call your dad 

1 -     Girl don't think I'm a fool 
        I know how you do 
        Guess you thought I was sprung 
        Girl don't think I'm so dumb 
        People told me 'bout you 
        And you think I never knew 
        In the end, I'll show you 
        Girl don't think I'm a fool 

Look, ain't no use in cryin' 
Your story I ain't buyin' 
Forget about it, ain't no use in tryin' 
My niggas they saw you with your heels up 
That's when I had to wake up wake up 
Somebody had to break up break up 
Cuz you's a girl I can't trust 
Yeah it hurt but I find someone better fo' sho' 
And she'll probably be lovin' me more 
So hit the door
