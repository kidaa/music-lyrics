Everything is gonna be alright 
Broken hearts are a part of life 
Don't you worry, you be strong 
Help you get along 

Everything is gonna be alright 
Find someone who would treat you right 
He don't deserve a woman like you 
Woman you are 

You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much 
'Till the morning he told you he was going away 
He lied to you, mistreated you 
He even raised his hand to you 
You weathered the storm but ended up in the rain 

It's driving you crazy 
You're wondering maybe 
Think it's something you did wrong 
You carried his baby 
But now now now lady 
Can't you see that you're so strong 
You were so strong 
The suns gonna shine again 
It won't be long
