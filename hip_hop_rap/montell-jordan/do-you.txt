[Intro]
Baby, what do you do when I'm not there 
It's a question's been on my mind 
I mean,  you know I'm coming 
But before I get there 
Tell me, do you 

Do you play the music low and burn your candles 
Do you touch yourself pretending that you're me 
Do you think of me touching things inside you 
Do you wish your hands were my hands making you scream 
And oh baby 

1 - 	Do you, do you think of me 
	Do you wish I were there killing you softly 
	Do you, do you still close your eyes 
	Every night and fantasize 
	Baby tell me, do you 

Do you lick your lips remembering how it tasted 
Do you miss the tender kisses down below 
Do your fingers do the walking when 
You hear our favorite song again 
I wanna know how do you please yourself 
When you are all alone 
Do you 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 

Tell me what do you do when I'm not there 
Do you massage your own body 
Do you wash your own hair 
Do you caress your own thighs 
Do you get yourself off 
Do you feel sexy when you close your eyes 
I wanna know 

Repeat 1 while: 
When you look in the mirror 
Do you see that sexy body 
Do you have the same admiration that I have 
It's like I can see right through you, yeah 
See, I've studied to learn everything that gets you horny 
And nobody knows you better than you 
You can show me, you can teach me 
I'm willing to learn 
Every little thing 
I'll take you there, I promise 
It'll be good 
Yeah, see no one does it better, babe 
And you're a good teacher 
Yes you are, so 

I'll be there in a little while
