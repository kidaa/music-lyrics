1 - 	Falling for you 
	And I just can't help myself 
	Baby I'm falling 
	Falling for you 
	And I just can't help myself 
	Baby I'm falling 

Thirty days since our first kiss 
Sit alone reminisce 
What you said last night just took me by surprise 
How you said you're not gonna cry no more 
You're waiting to exhale 
Having feelings that you're falling 
Woman I've already fell 

Repeat 1 

Contemplating what to do 
Falling faster over you 
But my heart and pride are out there on the line 
I dial your number on the phone 
A steady ringing your not home 
If you're listening to this message 
Girl I'm calling cuz I'm falling for you 

Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling 
Can't believe I'm falling 
Falling for you 
Do you feel the same way too 
And I just can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling 

Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling for you 
Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling for you 

Falling for you 
yes I am, yes I am 
And I just can't help myself 
can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling 
Oh I, oh I 
Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself 
Falling baby 
Baby I'm falling 
Falling baby 

I can't help myself 
Seems I keep on falling 
No, no I just can't help myself 
Seems I keep on falling 
No just can't help myself 
Seems like I keep on falling 
Yeah, help me 
Won't you help me sugar 

Repeat 1 
 I'm falling
