Why you wanna play tricks on my mind 
Why you wanna play tricks on my mind 
Why you wanna play tricks on my mind 
Why you wanna play tricks on my mind 

Come on in, dim the lights 
We can touch and then you can feel me rise 
I know you wanna do your thing 
But you just wanna keep holding out on me 

1 - 	Your body's playing tricks on my mind 
	All of your crazy games are driving me wild 
	Yes so wild and I'm so hypnotized 
	Stop playing tricks on my mind 

Oh, you know how to tease me 
Even when you go down on your knees 
Girl, don't I treat you right all the time 
So don't you wanna know what good love feels like 

2 - 	I know you remember 
	You kissed me you touched me 
	You liked the control 
	You're body says yes 
	But you're telling me no 

	So now girl I'm wondering how far we can go 
	You know you you want 
	So why you wanna play with your body 

Why you wanna play 
Why why why you wanna play with your body 
Why why why you wanna play 
Why why why you wanna play with your body 
Tell me why you wanna play
