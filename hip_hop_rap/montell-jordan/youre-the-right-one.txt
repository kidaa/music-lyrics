1 -	You're the right one 
	Right one I let get away 
	Ooh girl, now what can I say? 
	To get back into your happy days 

	You're the right one 
	Right one, what was wrong with me? 
	Missin' all that taddy 
	Promise me you'll save me some 
	Cuz baby 

I haven't seen you in a while 
By the looks of your profile 
Say it's been a year or more 
Since we both walked out the door 
You wanted kids and so did I 
You wanted a ring but I can't lie 
I was young and runnin' wild 
Seein' you has changed my mind 
Cuz you're 

Repeat 1 

Everyday that you've been gone 
I thinks about you and carries on 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But times are changin' and so have I 
I really really miss you from head to toe 
Tired of reminiscin', I can't let go 
It ain't good for me to be alone 
You're the right one, so c'mon, c'mon, ohh 

Repeat 1 

I'm just sittin' here, thinkin' about 
All our really good times 
The love that we shared together 
And the sparkle that was in your eyes 
I don't wanna lose you 
No, not for the second time 
So I'm ready to step on in 
Cuz you were so right 

Repeat 1 to fade
