I'm checking honey and she's licking her lips 
Dancing with her friend, but looking at me 
And if I'm not mistaken this is an invitation 
To participate with me, she and she, oh yeah 

1 - 	And now they're waiting for me 
	But they'll wait a little longer 
	I played it "Oh so" pimply 
	Cuz I might see something better 
	And I'll just slide in between 'em 
	I gotta let these shorties know 
	I'mma holla at you later 
	But right now I gots to flow 
	I gots to flow 

2 - 	Everybody get down 
	DJ start to get busy 
	Everybody get loud 
	Ladies start to get freaky 
	Niggas startin' to act wild 
	Let me know if you're with me 
	Everybody get down 

[KM] 	Work that thang 

Just like I thought, the night keeps getting better 
I sees this honey, too hot to miss 
She was sitting in a chair with her legs slightly spread 
Showing just how off the chain she is, yeah 

3 - 	And what she's showing to me 
	You could call it "Basic instinct" 
	I played it "Oh so" pimply 
	I told her when and where to meet me 
	See playboy ain't that anxious 
	So I just let honey know 
	I'mma twist her back up later 
	But right now I gots to flow, flow, flow 

Repeat 2 
Repeat 2 

A party ain't a party unless you got a shorty 
Movin' and shaking that ass on you 
It's so good, it's so right 
Girl, I'm feeling you tonight 
And the time is now so everybody can get down
