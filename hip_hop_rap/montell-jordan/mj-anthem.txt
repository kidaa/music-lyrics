Yeah, it's #5, I'm almost a veteran
And don't think I don't see you n****s looking'

VERSE I
Since 1995 I've been blowing on tracks like this
Got a lotta gold and platinum plaques like this
But I had it up to here so I'm R B bangin' on wax like this
In case you forgot, 5 times on the streets, I've been keeping it hot
Got your shorty on the block singing duda duda
And I could've held back,
But will I do that? Probably not.
See I represent Cali and it bees like that
And I'll probably get sampled because the track's so fat
The music industry has gotten out of control
You can't keep a deal unless you're platinum or gold
It's all I can stands, I can't stands no more
Mr. Nice Guy come to even the score
And I'm not holding my tongue
N****, you know my name and you know where I'm from.

CHORUS 
For all ya'll fakers, Def Jam haters
R B South Central Westside players
To all my homies that's sittin on dubs
With your girl in your ride turn this on up
It's all y'all fakers, Def Jam Haters
R B South Central Westside players
To all my homies on blades and dubs
With your girl in your ride turn it up, turn it up

VERSE II

The year is 2001, still flowin on tracks like this
Got a few more gold and platinum plaques like this
I've had it up to here so I'm R B bangin' on wax like this
In case you forgot, the word on the street is I'm keeping it hot
Everybody on your block singing duh, duh, duh, da
But I still can't believe after 5 LP's they can sleep on me
The singers with no skills, singers with no shoes, singers in bath tubs
Is that how you pay dues? 
The music industry has gotten out of control
Sell some records then you're out the back door

It's all I can stands, I can't stands no more
Mr. Nice Guy come to even the score
My man Focus blazed the track
And I wrote it, I sang it, I live it, believe that

REPEAT CHORUS 4x's
