I heard my door ring 
I was expecting you 
You hit my two way and told me you were rollin' through 
So nice to see you 
Step inside and let's get comfortable 
What?  My favorite outfit, no, you didn't girl 
Got your pedicure, manicure and hair curled 
But sho' it's your world, so tonight I think that 
You should know baby 

Top or bottom, we can take turns 
Makin' love to you, we're bound to get some rug burns 
So top or bottom baby 
When we're done 
You can lay by my side and be mine mine mine 
Even though you just got your hair done 
You need to sweat it just sweat it out baby, have fun 
So top or bottom baby 
When we're done 
You can lay by my side and be mine mine mine
