Hey baby
I like it when you're next to me
With that body horizontally
Your pretty legs comfortable in my bed
In your lingerie with my pillow under your head
And honey
I like you cuz you trust in me
Just so glad to have you on my team
So I'll keep it real with you
Girl I'm feelin' you, layin' here

[1] - Layin' next to you at night
Kissin' and holdin' you tight
All of these things I like
Girl you are mine, mine, mine

You got a lot of sex appeal
I love the way you make me feel
And what I feel is real
Girl you're one of a kind

Hey lady
You know just how to treat your man
So I will always be your biggest fan
I'll tell it all over the world, you're my closest friend
Much more than my girl, would ya
Stay with me and you just might see
Some kind of jewelry
That I know you've been waiting on
Baby you're the reason all my other girls are gone
What we share is so beautiful
And I think I might just spend my life waking up next to you

[Repeat 1]

Yo all of these things I like
Turn around girl, oh mine, mine, mine
Layin' next to you got a lot of sex appeal
Just feels so right shorty
I like that mine, mine, mine
