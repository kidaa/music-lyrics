VERSE I
The Story of a lonely man
Flipping channels on my T.V.
Just trying to watch anyone
Who's a little worser off than me
I'm still paralyzed by the news
I couldn't recognize all your clues
If I had walked a mile in your shoes
Well maybe then I'd understand
How you came to hate me so much
Can't remember when I held you last
Said I love you
Or felt your touch
And it's a shame that she nearly died
That woman that you kept inside
You can set her free 
but please don't leave

Chorus

VERSE II
It never mattered much to me
You complaining 'bout being mis-used
See I never ever raised my hand
Still you talkin' 'bout being abused
All the times that I withheld my love
Is that what you were speaking of
If I neglected you

I stand accused
See I didn't take care of your heart
Lord knows I can take the blame yea
But I can't take you walking out
Cause that never solved a dog-gone thang
Your leaving dropped a bomb on me
Now I'm nothing but a casualty
What remains of you
an empty room
I can't take it no more

REPEAT CHORUS

I can't take it no more
Girl you're the reason I feel this way
I can't fake it no more
Can't make it without you one more day
Oh, you're the best love I ever had
'Cause of you I'm a better man
And when you're not around
I'm going down
I can't take

BRIDGE
If you tell me that you'll never return
Then I might as well have never been born
Just say it's over on a Saturday night
I'll be long gone by Sunday morn
But when I'm gone it won't change the fact
I need you. 

REPEAT BRIDGE/CHORUS/ADLIBS
