This is a special song for you shorty 
Cause I think you forgot how we started out 
And I'm about to take you way back 
To our once upon a time 
Once upon a time, oh 
Yeah
Once upon a time 
Do you remember how we used to look at each other? 
Once upon a time 
Talk to each other, psh I remember 

Now it seems to me 
You're living in a dream world, fantasy 
In love with a nigga that can never be 
What I can be 
Ya think ya ballin' now 
But do you recall? 
Us bus riding, window shopping at the mall 
We were broke as a nigga but we had it all 
We had it all 
I'm here to remind you of our 

1 -	Once upon a time, oh 
	Once upon a time 
	Once upon a time, say 
	Once upon a time 
	Oh say 
	I remember when 
	Once upon a time, oh 
	You came into my life 
	Once upon a time 
	Making love all night 
	Once upon a time, oh 
	Once upon a time 
	As time goes on 

Now we made some dough 
But separate not together 
Like we planned it all 
Somehow it all became what is mine's is mine 
What's yours is yours 
What the hell were we thinking? 
If I could read your mind 
I'd reach into your heart and soul 
To try to find the love that was missing 
Left so far behind, so far behind 
I'm here to remind you of our 

Repeat 1 

Take it to the bridge now 
Oh, oh, oh 
Once upon a time 
Hold on, hold on baby 
And do you remember 
Running up your mama's phone bill baby 
Didn't wanna hang up for nothing 
And it's a quarter to three 
Kept on talking for hours 
Till we both fell asleep 

Once upon a time, oh 
Just think about it, think about it 
Once upon a time 
Whoa
Once upon a time, oh 
I'm gon take you back right now 
To the bus pass days 
Now do you remember? 
Once upon a time 
Standing on the bus stop with me baby 
Once upon a time, oh 
We had no fancy cars and no diamond rings 
Once upon a time 
No credit cards, no bling, bling
