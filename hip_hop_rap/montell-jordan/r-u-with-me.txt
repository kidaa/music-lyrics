Baby, this song is for you
I don't give a damn
what nobody else thinks
What they say
Because they have no idea
What we've been through
Where we are at or where we are going
Only God knows where we are going, right?

VERSE I
I was afraid
To open up 
To you
And I was ashamed 
To reveal
The weakness inside of me
So thankful you came
And built me up
Made me understand
How to be your man
How to love you and
How to treat you

CHORUS
Are you with me
Tonite oh
And every night
Till the end of time
Till the bye and bye
Oh baby, baby
Are you with me
For life oh
Just you and me
Exclusively
For the world to see
Baby is you
Are you with me?

VERSE II
So many nights
Of broken vows to you 
Trying to fight
The lusts of my body
The thoughts in my mind
The night you laid hands on me
My spirit changed
And I'm not the same
Cause you chose to stand
Next to Abraham
Your imperfect man,
And I thank you Sarah, Sarah

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Are you with me tonight and every night
Till the end of time I'll treat you right
Till the bye and bye girl I am there
If it were my last breath I would share
Cause you're worth the world and more to me
Every angel in heaven agrees
You're the very reason that I breathe 
Are you with me

REPEAT BRIDGE/CHORUS/ADLIBS
