1 - 	Never alone 
	Use your heart as a telephone 
	Never alone 
	You know Montell won't do you wrong 

I asked your woman why she's crying 
She told me she was lonely 
She thought you were the perfect guy 
But you could never love her only 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not the one 
Breaking up a happy home 
It's the loney man who understands 
She don't wanna be alone 

Repeat 1 

So I ask her if you treat her right 
She don't deny that your love is tight 
But sometimes she only needs a friend 
When she calls on me quarter after three 
Holding pillows to the phone 
It's her lonely heart that you're tearing apart 
You don't even have a clue 

2 - 	You don't have to be alone, baby 
	Anytime you cry, day or night 
	You'll never be alone 

	Use your heart as a telephone, baby 
	It's not too late, cuz this must die 
	Before you run to me 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 

Repeat 1 while: 
Whoa, world don't need 
Another broken heart 
If you leave her all alone 
I'll do what I gotta do 
And when we're together we'll be saying 
Here's a toast to that fool 

The woman's lonely 
She's reaching out 
Pick up the phone baby, honey 
Needs to talk to 
Where are you, pick it up baby, baby 
Someone who's willing to listen 
Is it you? 
Will you be there?
