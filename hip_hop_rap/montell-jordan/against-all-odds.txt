How can I just let you walk away 
Just let you leave without a trace 
When I stand here taking every breath with you, you 
You're the only one who really knew me at all 

How can you just walk away from me 
When all I can do is watch you leave 
Girl we shared the laughter and the pain 
We even shared the tears 
You're the only one who really knew me at all 

1 - 	Take a look at me now 
	There is just an empty space 
	There's nothing left here to remind me 
	Just a memory of your face 

Take a look at me now 
There is just an empty space 
And you're coming back to me is against the odds 
That's a chance I've gotta take 

I wish I could just make you turn around 
Turn around and see me cry 
There's so much I need to say to you 
So many reasons why 
You're the only one who really knew me at all 

Repeat 1 

Take a look at me now 
There is just an empty space 
And girl just to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've gotta face 

Take a look at me now 
Cuz I will still be standing here 
You're coming back to me is against the odds 
That's a chance I gotta take 

Take a look at me now 
Coming back to me is against the odds 
That's the chance I gotta take 

Look at me now, now, now, now, now 
I'm so sad, sad, sad, sad, sad 
Look at me now, now, now, now, now 
Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad 
Look at me now, now, now, now, now 
No, no, no, no, no 
Look at me now, now, now, now, now
