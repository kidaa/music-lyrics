[Intro]
[TP]	I'm so ready for everybody to go home 
[MJ]	Yeah, me too 
[TP]	I want you so bad right now 
[MJ]	You ready? 
[TP]	Let's do this 

Think it's time to say goodbye 
To our company 
Now it's time to say goodbye 
To all our company 
I don't wanna wait any longer, yeah 

Some friends came by to kick it 
But the time is passing slow 
We've wined and dined for half the night 
We told every joke that we know 
Now I don't mind entertaining 
But your body language is telling me 
Along with your bedroom eyes 
Feels like it's time for them to leave now 

1 - 	It's getting late 
	And I don't want them to stay 
	They don't have to go home 
	But they gotta get up, get out, and get on 

2 - 	Think it's time to say goodbye 
	To our company 
	So glad they could come 
	But they stayed too long 
	Don't mean to be rude 
	But they need to go home 

3 - 	Now it's time to say goodbye 
	To all our company 
	We're so glad you could come 
	They stayed too long 
	Don't mean to be rude 
	They need to go home 

[TP]
Baby, I'm feeling you 
And I'm glad you're so attentive to my every move 
I know that you want it 
So why don't we just play it cool 
And hope they're leaving soon 
Let's wait a while is what I said before 
But this waiting is making me want you more 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 2 
Repeat 3 

We like it when you drop by for a minute 
Excited that you came by here to kick it 
But when they see the foreplay in our eyes 
I think they should realize 
That it's getting time to go 
I can sneak a feel and they won't know 
We want you to go home 
We need to spend tonight alone 
Tonight alone, tonight alone boy 

Repeat 3 
Repeat 2 
Repeat 3 

Gave me a sign 
The look in your eyes 
Says you want it baby 
Put yourself on it babe 
Can't take it no more 
Won't you lay on the floor 
And I'll be keeping you warm 
I'm so glad that they're gone
