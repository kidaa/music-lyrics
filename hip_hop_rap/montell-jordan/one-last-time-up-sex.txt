[Intro]
Come here  
Come here  
So what we gon' do?  
You down  
I know  
Let's do this, ok?  
Let's do this  
Don't say no, don't say no, don't say no  

Here we are again, in this bed again  
Making love again, afraid to let it end  
The sex seems better when we've had an argument  
But you're not leaving and I'm not leaving  
So let's do what we came to do  
Even though last night  

1 - 	We said it was over  
	But we're here tonight  
	We're just getting started  
	And it's possible we'll break up again in the morning  
	So turn it up, press rewind  
	Let's get it on one last time  

So we kissed and said goodnight  
Then a little time went by  
You found somebody new, well, I'm seeing someone too  
She can't take the place of you  
Our arguments and fights  
Cuz breaking up and making up  
Has made some unforgettable nights  

Repeat 1  
Repeat 1  

Lying in my arms, the calm after the storm  
When the tears fall  
The music can drown out the sound of you crying  
It's so hard to be just friends  
It'll probably hurt again  
So let's just pretend  
We're still in love  

Last night  

Repeat 1  
Repeat 1  

I just might hurt you again
