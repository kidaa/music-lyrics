Huh My grandmomma was raised on a reservation
Huh My great-grandmomma was, from a plantation
They sang - songs for inspiration
They sang - songs for relaxation
They sang - songs, to take their minds up off that
fucked up situation
I am... yes I am... the descendant yes yes
of those folks whose, backs got broke
who, fell down inside the gunsmoke
Black people!  Chains on they ankles and feet
I am descendants, of the builders of your street
Black people!  Tenders to your cotton money
I am.. hip-hop
	";It's heavy metal for the black people";
I am.. rock and roll rock and roll.. rock'n'roll
BEEN HERE FOREVER!
They just ain't let you know.. HA!
I said, Elvis Presley ain't got no soul huh
Chuck Berry is rock and roll damn right
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that style on they own uh-uh
Elvis Presley ain't got no SOULLLL hell naw
Little Richard is rock and roll damn right
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that shit on they own nah-ah
Guess that's just the way shit goes
You steal my clothes and try to say they yo's yes they do
Cause it's a show filled with pimps and hoes
Tryin to take everything that you made or control there they go
Elvis Presley ain't got no SOULLLL
Bo Diddley is rock and roll damn right
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't the first place the credit belongs

and Motown
huh I ain't tryin to diss
but I don't be tryin to fuck with Limp Bizkit
	";The fuck is on your mind?";
When I get down in my zone
I be rockin Bad Brains and Fishbone
I ain't tryin to slow your groove
But that ain't the way I'm tryin to move
I don't turn on Korn to get it on;
I be playin Jimi Hendrix 'til the dawn
That's my word is bond
Sittin up on my front lawn
Got the volume turned to ten
Playin Albert King the best again black
When the mornin in the cooker
Got to turn on some John Lee Hooker
When I want some rock and roll
Go to Otis Redding to get some soul
Say, James Brown got plenty of soul
James Brown like to rock and roll
He can do all the shit fo' sho'
that Elvis Presley could never know black people
Said, Kenny G ain't got no SOULLLL
John Coltrane is rock and roll uh-huh
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
but they could never ever rock like Nina Simone
Say whoahhhh-oh don't take it oooh-wee-ohh
