[Mos Def] 
Hey, you don't like me 
That's alright I like me 
I got something to say to you 

I see you standing on the side 
With your smile and your crooked eyes 
Actin' like a man 
But a chick frontin' in disguise 
Pokin' on some thicker thighs 
Smokin' on a blunt of lies 
Tradin' in they badge 
For a sash sayin' "SUCKER, HI!" 
Lookin' at her son now 
Probably make a mother cry 
Should've listen to that song 
Telling you to walk on by 
But you didn't, now your washed up 
Like a cup of Tide 
Let me know I got the heat 
When you think it's time to dry 

[Mekhi] 
Who you think you talkin' bout? 
Mistaking me for some other guy 
Need to buy a watch 
Cause ain't no shorty gonna give the time 
Day or night, birthdays, Kwaanzas or Valentines 
Big talk, really small 
But you ain't a friend of mine 
You ain't even genuine 
Sweeter that a cin-a-bun 

[Mos Def Mekhi]
But with five fingers in a fist 
I'm deadly as the Pentagon 
YOU DON'T WANT BEEF WITH MILLER 
CAUSE I'M ILLA 
Or you because you bout as criminal as killa 
Ooh ha, I see you slick with the words now 
Gash cause you got a chick with curves now 
Calm your nerves down 
You was locked, Carmen Brown 
Jaws had hers now, scored on the first down 
Yeah so get your keys out your purse now 
Run to your car 'fore you laying in a hearse clown 
How you sound, yo you dirtier than jurors now 
Extortin all that money thought you'd have a couple furs now 
Huh, watch your speed 
I ain't one to play around 
You got your heads in the clouds now 
I'm 'bout to bring you to the ground 
There's something that you need to know 
They got you on video? 
SIKE, but your girl Carmen Brown is a silly ho
