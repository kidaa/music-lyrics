When...all...is...said...and...done...there's...only...one

Cash and carry legendary Sagitarrius style's wary
And it's very necessary get it clearly
Never scary barely worried bright and early
Bald head straight or curly mundane other worldly
No chain now the jewelry that jackers can't snatch
The gingerbread the slave masters can't catch
Blat! Now put your minds on that
Get real or get back quit frontin and face facts
The old timers say we're living in the final days
Gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
Gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways
Meanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates
Crash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age
Access is instant and treachery is commonplace
I sense the dangers and I'm not afraid
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE

Man up playboy playing the game boy
Pull back spectacular aim boy
Say what you say boy whoever could make noise
And ride range off in the same voice
Conduct an arrangement with definite language
It's pure inspiration for this generation
Speak true free love ?
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE

And the one can done so cool
Schooling the young like Rev. Run "whose house?"
Quote pop and 'til they keep their heads up
And when the pressure comes down press back and press up
Fret not ghetto world guess what
God is on your side the devil is a lie
The Empire holds all the gold and the guns
But when all is said and done there's only...

B.O.O.G.I.E.M.A.N

Practice doesn't make perfect, PERFECT PRACTICE makes perfect
