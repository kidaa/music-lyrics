feat. Lauryn Hill

[Intro:]
[sirens] Yo yes yes yo. Lock your door. Die die die [x6]

[Wyclef:]
I remember comin' from Hati growin' up in Brooklyn
On Flat Bush got my first sneakers tooken
Learn the game quick so I got my first device
Mom move to Jersey so we could get a better life
But little did she know a ghetto is a ghetto 
Good time found myself like Jimmy Walker sayin' "Cello"

[Lauryn:]
Yellow cheese bus gettin' beatings if I cuss
Lay away another day in stripped Lees and letegrays
But the lyrical bomber momma tried to stop
Paranoid cause this boy around my neighborhood got shot
Name plate hair straight metal braces on my teeth
Fat laces on my feet when crack first hits the streets

[Wyclef:]
I use to push up on a girl Salt 'N' Peppa Push It Push It
D's in school cause the music was my focus
Jokes in class but when I learned I didn't pass 
I knew it was my ass with my mothers leather lash
Belt buckle said Nelly Nel similar to Melle Mel 
Hits the third rail Beat Street made Gazzels sells

[Lauryn:]
As the tale gets poetic watch the streets turn magnetic
Towanna Balley's rape is alleged
Hang out in hooky places watch streets corners turn to oasis
Young men aspire to be Scarfaces

[Hook:]
In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be around next year

[Wyclef talking:]
Yo yo watch out for the black van. Yo yo last days last days planes
exploding yo close your door yo nobody's safe. Halloween. October 31.  Yo
close your
door yo kids are disappearing. Yo

[Wyclef:]
Late at night the light was bright on the ave
I went to pick up cash from my cousin little Kev
He told me Joe had a dream in jail he got steamed
His wife became a fiend fuckin' little Raheim
Damn, drugs will make you do terrible things
He told me when he get out he's murdering by any means
The day came I saw him on the train 
He pulled his gun and aimed and started firing like the son of Kane
I saw civilians runnin' for their life 
Like the devil on judgement night running from Christ
Ice and Armarretto please as I fell to my knees
Being shot by Fergusin the vigilante

[Hook]

[Wyclef talking:]
So CNN nawhatI'msayin Fergusin is at court and he's his own lawyer
youknowmean what's goin' on. Talk to me. This is definatly the last days.
Jewish calendar has already arrived the year 2000. Watch ya back watch ya
back watch ya back DIE DIE DIE DIE

[Lauryn:]
Clef it kind of remind me of this chick I once knew
Use to be a dime now she's strung out in Bellevue
See the serpent played tricks run game like the Knicks
Build you up just to lose the championship.
I seen her reminisce over Wu-Tang could It Be that Simple 
She lost her Prince cause there were Thieves In the Temple
Tragic depression made her lose all her teeth
Lost and turned out gave her body to the streets
Sweet Mary don't you weep 
Still water runs deep 
So be carful of the company you keep

[Hook]

[Wyclef talking:]
Yo I'm frustrated youknowhatI'mean Use to work at McDonalds just got
fired.
If I get in I'm sprayin' everybody the boss the manager yo these are
definatly the last days. Yo here he comes with his gun yo duck duck. Black
Panther yo nobody's protected. Yo 6-6-6 watch your back don't get caught in
the rapture yo AIDS, Moses the plaque watch your back. Pharoh let my people
go.

sister is Rosey Sharen. Yo yo nobody's protected. Not even Rosey Sharen.
