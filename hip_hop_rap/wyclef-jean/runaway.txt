feat. Earth, Wind & Fire, The Product G&B;

[Wyclef]
To my people doing time
To my people rest in peace y'all ready for the refugee camp
Introducing Earth, Wind & Fire
Yah yah yah 
Come on come on come on       

No money in my pocket 
Gotta get a no limit
So I became America's most wanted
All I ever wanted was a fancy car
A crib for my mom and a mastercard
Baby you know it's in Hollywood
New cop flicks with Clint Eastwood
Went from a teen to a young adult
No excuses aint't my fault

[Bridge]
Runaway
We living like runaways
Wake up
Stretching in the morning
Trying to make it through the day
Brush my teeth
Hit the streets
Where there's heat 
We afford to beef
Hoping one day
We don't have to run away
Gotta Escape

[Chorus]
I didn't want to runaway          
But I had to get a way yo gotta get away
We didn't want to runaway
But we had to get away yo gotta get away
I didn't want to leave astray
But sometimes I gotta get away yo gotta get away
I didn't want to go away
But I had to go away yo

Yo G&B; where you at

[Product G&B;]

Momma came home from a hard days work
At day time a maid at night time a nurse
Work so hard to make sure we survived
Living a ghetto paradise
Sometimes I wake up screaming in the middle of the night
Hoping that darkness brings me light
Praying for that better day where we won't have to runaway

[Bridge]
Runaway
We living like runaways
Wake up
Stretching in the morning
Trying to make it through the day
Brush my teeth
Hit the streets
Where there's heat 
We afford to beef
Hoping one day
We don't have to run away

[Chorus]
I didn't want to runaway          
But I had to get a way yo gotta get away
We didn't want to runaway
But we had to get away yo gotta get away
I didn't want to leave astray
But sometimes I gotta get away yo gotta get away
I didn't want to go away
But I had to go away yo

Ladies and gentleman Earth, Wind & Fire
