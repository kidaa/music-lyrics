feat. South Park Kids Matt Stone,Trey Parker

[Wyclef] I go by the name of Wyclef Jean
We are the RefFugee All-Stars one two
We salute the soldiers around the world
[Eric C] Hell yes!
[Wyclef] This one is called bullet in your bubblegoose

[Wyclef begins harmonizing]

[Eric C] Mack 10!
[Kyle B] Cartman, this isn't Mack 10
[Eric C] SERIOUSLY, Mack 10!

[Wyclef Jean]
Sit right back and you'll hear a tale
of a hustler 'round my way
Who used to clock, around the block
from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match
Windows bulletproof
One night he jumped out the car
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

[Chorus One: Wyclef + Kids repeat 2X]

He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be - at the party gettin loose
but you can catch a bullet in your 'goose

[Wyclef] Sit right back and you'll hear a tale
of a young girl around my way
[Eric C] Wesssyde!

[Wyclef Jean]
Who used to dance around the way
from where my homeboys stayed
Black BMW with rims to match
Windows bulletproof
One night she jumped out the car
and caught a bullet in her bubblegoose

[Chorus Two: Wyclef + Kids repeat 2X]

She caught a bullet in her bubblegoose
She caught a bullet in her bubblegoose
You can be - at the party gettin loose
but you can catch a bullet in your 'goose

[Wyclef begins harmonizing]

[Eric C] Mack 10, you guys
[Stan M] This isn't Mack 10!

[Eric Cartman] 
It IS MACK 10!!! ..
Kenny  Your family's poor Kenny!
Get up Kenny!
Kenny, you can't just die
Yeahhh, Mack 10 in the hiz-ouse you guyyys!

[Chorus Two]

[Kyle B] Damn that's high dude!
[Eric C] Yeah, Mack TEN!!
[Wyclef] This one for the people
[Eric C] Hell yeah!
