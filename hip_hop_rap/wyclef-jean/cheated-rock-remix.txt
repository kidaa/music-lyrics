[Wyclef spoken]

Rolling Stones could not be here with you tonight, Led Zepplin couldn't
be here with you tonight, but we got Wyclef Jean in the house tonight.
Yo, I woke up on the other side of the bed.  Tune into my rock station,
and someone say hip-hoppers can't play rock and roll, huh.

[Wyclef] singing Chorus:]

I cheated on you, you cheated on me,
and this is not the way that things are supposed to be,
so tell me girl, is this for real or just an illusion
I pinch myself to make sure that Wyclef ain't dreamin'

[Wyclef] singing Verse 1:]

By the time you here this song, it'll be number 1 on your radioooooooooo.
You'll be drivin' from the beach, 
and your boyfriend will say turn it down real loooooow.
You punch up the sun roof! 
And you roll down the window, slam that pedal to the floooooooooor.
whatchin the whats wrong 
Shes havin a good jour  It said love don't let me no mooooore  
to all the girls I cheated on before

[Wyclef] singing Chorus:]

I cheated on you, you cheated on me, 
and this is not the way that things are supposed to be,
so tell me girl, is this for real or just an illusion
I pinch myself to make sure that wyclef ain't dreamin'

I cheated on you, you cheated on me To all the girls I cheated on before
and this is not the way that things are supposed to be,
so tell me girl is this for real or just an illusion
I pinch myself to make sure that Wyclef ain't dreamin'

[Wyclef singing Verse 2:]

I don't know much about philosophy, play though, all I rest I know 
all I know, when I met you, in the streets, the air wasn't so cooooooooold.
It's like my whole world just changed.
I'm like a ball with no chain,
