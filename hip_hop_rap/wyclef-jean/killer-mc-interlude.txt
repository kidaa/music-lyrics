[Wyclef:]
Hello, boys and girls.
Welcome to Wyclef Words of Wisdom.
I am here with an m.c. that 
everyone is scared of.
He has killed over a million
people on record and he's still
not locked up.
Am, what is your name sir

[Killer M.C.:] Nuhmsayin Am...
[Wyclef:] Yeah. Basically, if you have
killed so many people why ain't
you locked up
[Killer M.C.:] I'm sayin' though like,
nuhmsayin
[Wyclef:] Yeah, exactly my point.
Don't believe the hype.
