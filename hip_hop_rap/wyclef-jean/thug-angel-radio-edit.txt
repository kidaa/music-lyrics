Thug Angel Radio Edit

Refugees yo.. all you say

[Wyclef Jean]
Dirty Dirty Dirty South
I used to play while at the YMCA, in L.A.
Sold my first A-K
I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, Bloody Sunday
What about Texas? They need to chill with the gun play
New York city y'all Police are at the door
the Magnum was by the ashtray
Look at shorty y'all He bout to go out like Scarface
He woke up in a cardboard box with no space
with Thug Angels singin, sayin

    [background harmonizing - repeat 2X]

So you wanna be a thug?
To all my thugs in Houston, you wan' push drugs?
To all my thugs in Memphis, you want the cars in the videos?
To the Jacksonville Thug Angels, let me tell you how it really goes

[Wyclef Jean]
I'm on the highway with a black bandana, headed to Atlanta
Until I heard WOOP WOOP, that  Sound of Da Police , should I pull over?
He had the dark shades on, but he ain't look like Stevie Wonder
His face was, pale and long - he looked like cold day in December
Now let me ask the truth or somethin - 
should I slow down and be a good camper?
I heard a young thug scream, 
 It depends what you got in the beamer!! 
Now I got two choices I could blast and become Most Wanted in America
Or I could slow down like the man in the Bronco 
and get Johnny Cochran to be my lawyer
Ohh Sonya, hit her on the Motorola
If I get locked up I ain't getting out 'til Tuesday
Cause this is Saturday, and it's a holiday
Now I got to spend a week hangin in the South in jail
but you told me that crime pay

What about Brooklyn? They need to chill with the gun play
Hey Police are at the door

New Jersey He bout to go out like Scarface
He woke up in a cardboard box with no space

[Wyclef Jean]
So you a killer, how many people did you kill?
You a dealer, how many drugs did you deal-a?
For'realla, used to sell crack on the hill-a
Yeah right! My name is Elvis and your wife is Pricilla
You're an ACTOR, you need a part in this thrilla
Hold up, ain't no nead to bust your four-fifth-a
It's two of use, one of use is bound to leave in a coma
So say your prayers, and give my regards to the undertaker
