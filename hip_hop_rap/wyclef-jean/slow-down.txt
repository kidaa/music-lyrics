10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 
We cry for peace Uh huh
But we live for war You know I got that shot in the chevy what it is?
We aint start the wire taps down in Baltimore But I still slangin bricks where I live
Sometimes she love me, sometimes she love me not Doin 10 now my girl turning tricks at the crib
But let check out his eyes, in the inner city Chi Layin down ASAP, eerbody in the trap gettin killed
Evil lurks in the heavenly disguise Tryin to get the ruler all I need is about a mil
I seen two birds crash into two New York giants Bush still lyin, he don never keep it real
I wish Katrina spoke French at the quarter to New Orleans Haha, but youd a told her that
But how we smoke French back, seduced this stone Okay
told this is your death, please dont rain on my people

[Chorus]
Whered the hope go, Whered the hope I dont know
I see the whole world turn into a warzone What?
Aint no love in the city keep your vest on G that right
Guns n roses welcome to the jungle
On the flip side ay, she shakin her back side Shake it for me
Thats the only way tuition gon come right

If you livin in the street
You know your livin free And if you aint you know your doin time like me
Thugs with the heat, are the coldest ones to meet You can catch yourself a case get a fine do 3
We flyin high, but still cant touch the sky But on conspiracy your doing ten at the least
Everbodys a gangsta, but no-body wanna die With all this snitchin you might never see the streets
Nuclear testing, replacin the SATs With all this going on why they worried about me
Stem cell research theres another you another me Im just hustling in the streets tryin to flip a couple keys
With what goes up, must come down, the laws of gravity I know I see it happen to my partner big neege, We miss ya shawrty!
To win at chess, youve got to trap the king Ay

[Chorus]
Whered the hope go, Whered the hope I dont know
I see the whole world turn into a warzone What?
Aint no love in the city keep your vest on G that right
Guns n roses welcome to the jungle
On the flip side Ay, she shakin her back side Shake it for me
Thats the only way tuition gonna come right Cha

Hey I remember get money Get money
All we do is get money Get money
Til the feds raided the trap and took my Thang from me
Put me in a room alone, separated the click form me Click from me
Next thing you my lawyer said My partner snitched on me on me
Now aint that a bitch homie, They aint have a thing on us
Until you started telling now they talking big numbers
We couldve split charges up, against five or six summer Summers
Instead you tryin to talk telling so you could walk
How could you tell em who we sold told to?
Eerthing we bought?
How we used to get in, all the way til we can ship it off?
Who woulda thought? Thought
Hey keep it pimpin, wait a minute Whoa
Ay keep it pimpin wait a minute, ay
