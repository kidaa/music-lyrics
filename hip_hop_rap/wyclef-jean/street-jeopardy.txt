feat. Jean Forte, R.O.C.

[Wyclef speaking:]
Guys, you have to be more gangster, more blood
more gun talk, more people dying, more hardcore
Enough, come on, I'm not feeling it man
More, more, man I got you
Alright, come with it [gunshot]

[Man:]
The million dollar question is, the million dollar question is...
S.. s.. street corner...

[Wyclef singing:]
this is what he said

Have you ever heard the sound of a .44, at your door
this is what I said
You got guns you got guns, I got guns uh-huh
Meet me at the corner store
this is what he said what does it all mean
After school, wild wild west
Even the teacher got a vest this is what I said
You can ask, on the block,  what does it all mean
Street Jeopardy... here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo
Have you ever played Jeopardy...
here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo

[Wyclef]
Not me, it could never happen to me
Professor says what you wanna do  Sell drugs or get a degree
Looked at him and smiled with 32 gold teeth
And said what you make in a year, I make it in a week
Elementary at the time, I don't think of gettin caught
Sellin with degrees, pickups at the seaport come on
Once caught, you know the drill, it's military
I can't lie, it gets scary, you screamin' for your mommy come on
Truth or dare, beware, the game is never fair
I'm fallin and I can't get up, like a dead hare
You stare like you seen me before
Yup, you put the gat to my gut, stuck me up in the truck
And said, "Don't nothin move but the goods"
Caught an arrow in your back fuckin wit Robin Hood

[John Forte]
This street life'll get you if the hustle don't fit you
Paranoid crews don't choose, nigga stick you
Arms and foldin macks to ya back tryin'a vick you
Belief in my crew wishin' foes never get through
And if so, Shalom, bless my soul, I'm home
I lived my life to the fullest, neighborhoods now known
A stone face is outta place when discussin B.I.
If I have a second thought, you ought not reply
I fought hot and sticky summers when the game started heatin
Competition, mega jail, and the well, who was eatin oh well
And every cell in the bang had a tenant
With each of them regrettin they was in it

[Wyclef singing:]

Have you ever heard the sound of a .44, at your door
You got guns, I got guns
Meet me at the corner store what does it all mean
After school, wild wild west
Even the teacher got a vest
You can ask, on the block, what does it all mean
Street Jeopardy... here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo
it's a shame in the game when you lose, son, they probably stoned ya today
Have you ever played Jeopardy...
here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo
money doubles for your troubles though you lose some
in the end it's all pain

[R.O.C.]
Yeah, yeah
I got up, sunny day, hood callin my name
Strange, I feel nauseous, memories of a pine cauffin
Seemed to me that I was dreamin
I'd been struck by a crazed fan after the concert, damn
Slugs form and I hurt, hopped up, checked my physical
But the pain was all mental, I slipped into
The shower, hopped out, got dressed, hit the blocks
Swarmed with cops, mad shots, hot shells dropped
You ever heard the sound of a .44 at your door
Before, many times, I answered back with a milli
Now what  Now give me mine
It ain't no games like B.D.P.
My 9-meter go da-da-da-da-dang-hey hey

[Wyclef singing:]
