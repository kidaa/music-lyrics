feat. Lauryn Hill

[Chorus]

Ki ayisien kap di'm map mache New-York san fezi 
Which haitian says i walk in New-York without a gun
Mwen di ou messie nou menti
I tell you man y'all lying
Le bum yo ginbe ou yo devore ou se le ou mouri police vini
When the bum catches you they eat you up it's when you die the police comes
Mwen di ou messie nou menti 
I tell you man y'all lying

Penden'm kanpe sou flatbush mwen woue on police ap vini 
While standing on flatbush i saw the a cop comin'
Li di mwen map vann drog 
He said i'm selling drug
mwen di mon che ou menti 
I told man you're lying
Li vin pou'l vin cheke'm mwen di mwen pa gen anyen
He came to check me out i told him i had nothing
Se nan yon ti bal mwen tapwal la pou' cheke on ti zen
I was going to a party to check the 411
Big up big up phantom mwen renmen tabou combo
Big up big up phantom haitian band i like tabou combo another band 
Se sak fe depwim nan bal la mwen mande kote moun yo
That's if i'm in the bal i ask where's the poeple
Timtim bwa sek mwen couri lem ouvri pot
Timtim bwa sek creole salute i ran to open the door
Nan yon cimitie pase mwen woue on tet san kok
In a cemetery cause i saw i head without a rooster
A b c d f g si`ou vle batay se danje
A b c d f g if you wanna fight it's danger
Mem si ou kon jwe foutbol denie gol lan se pou pele
Even if could play soccer the last goal if for pele brazilian soccer player
Pa joure manmam, manmam se kreol 
Don't diss my mom, my mom is creole
Fesi'm se bousol
My gun guides me
Kompa'm se lakol
My direction sticks
Original ayisieeennnn kwa de boukeeee
Original haitian Croix-des-Bouquets Wyclef's town
Gen neg ki pense brooklyn'm fet ayiti'm fet kwa de bouke kwa de bouke
Some niggers thinks i was born in brooklyn, i was in Haiti in Croix-des-Bouquets

Tande
Listen

[Chorus]

Prezidan mwen pa vle prezidan ou
President, i don't wanna be your president
Wase mikrofon nan mwen se gouveman ou
Give me the microphone i become your goverment
Bon nom'm se Wyclef yo rele'm fanfan
My real name's wyclef they call me fanfan
Mwen gen on ti se yo rele roz salon
I have a little sister that is called roz salon
Mwen yon cheval ki vole chak swa
I got a horse who flys every night
Mwen gen cheve pwav mwen pa vle cheve soi
I got a nappy head i don't have silky hair
Bad boy ayisien ki soti en ayiti
Haitian bad boy straight from Haiti
Depui mwen gen pwoblem mwen rale ouzi
If got a problem i pull a uzi
Le mal lekol ameriken te kon joure'm
When i went to school american's used to diss me
Yo relem neg nwe yo relem ti refijie
They called black nigger they called a little refugee 
Jan yo pale mwen woue yo pa civilise 
The way they talked i saw they where not civilised
Jan yo pale mwen woue yo pa kon bon djie
The way they talked i saw they didn't know god
45 bo kotem plis mwen gen de pie kole 
45 by my side plus i got bot feet together
si on neg teste'm mape pete de gren zie'l
If a nigger test me i'm gonna stab his eyes
Orijinal ayitien ki soti jerizalem
Original haitian straight from jerusalem
Si on neg teste'm ane sa a ou pap oue nwel 
If a nigger tests me you wont see christmas this year

[Chorus]

Tande 
Listen

[man's voice]
Kote moun yo mwen pa woue moun yo 
Where's the poeple i don't see the poeple

[Lauryn]
Then you should know 
That one day we are gone 
So keep your head to the sky
See the path we refuse is the path we should choose 
They wont take the world when you die 

Ayitien tiree
Haitian fire

Leve le men leve le men chante chante 
Hands up hands up sing sing

Yon bagay yo di'm fi petyon vil pa vle neg ki gen cheve pwav mwen gen cheve pwav
They told me something girls from Petion-Ville don't want nigga's 
with nappy heads well i've got a nappy head
