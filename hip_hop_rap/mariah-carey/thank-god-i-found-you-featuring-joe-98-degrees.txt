Mariah
I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I've finally found a man that's true
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
I felt like dying 
Until you saved my life

Chorus - all
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream 
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you

Joe
I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do 
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right
Cause I need you in my life

Chorus - all
Thank God I found you I'm begging you
I was lost without you so lost without you
My every wish and every dream every dream, every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you 


-Bridge- Mariah   Joe
See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess it shows 
that we were destined to shine 
After the rain to appreciate 
And care for what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

Chorus - all
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you lost without you baby
My every wish and every dream 
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful 
I found you


Chorus - all
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful
I found you

Mariah
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful I found you
