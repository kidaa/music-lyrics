My first love 
You're every breath that I take 
You're every step I make 

And I 
I want to share 
All my love with you 
Mmmmmmh 
And your eyes 
They tell me how much you care 
Oh, yes 
You will always be 
My endless love 
Yeah 

Two hearts 
Two hearts that beat as one 
Our lives have just begun 
And forever 
I'll hold you close in my arms 
I can't resist your charms 
No no no no 

And I 
I'd be a fool 
For you, I'm sure 
You know I don't mind 
No 'cause baby you 
You mean the world to me, oh 
I know, I've found in you 
My endless love 

[instrumetal break] 
Do do, do dooo, do do do 

Whooooa 
And love 
I'd be the fool 
For you, I'm sure 
That you know I don't mind 
Oh, yes 
You'd be the only one 
'Cause no-one can't deny 
This love I have inside 
And I'll give it all to you 
My love my love, my love 
My endless love 

Mmmmmh
