A broken man without a home,
Desperate and so alone,
A victim of society,
Noon really wants to see,

Bridge:
Some of us don't even wonder,
Some of us don't even care,
Couldnt we just help each other,
Isnt there enough to share.

Chorus:
Theres got to be a way,
To connectt this world today,
Come together to relieve the pain
Theres got to be a way,
To unite this human race,
And together we'll bring on a change.

In another land they still believe
Colour grants supremecy
I dont understand how there can be
Regulated bigotry

Bridge:
Some of us dont even wonder,
Some of us dont even care,
Couldnt we accept each other,
Cant we make ourselves aware

Chorus

Hey! And maybe then the future will be a time,
Without war, destitution and sorrow.
And hungry children wont have to die
Oh! If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow-oh

Bridge
Some of us dont even wonder,
Some of us dont even care
Couldnt we just love each other
Isnt there enough to share

Chorus
