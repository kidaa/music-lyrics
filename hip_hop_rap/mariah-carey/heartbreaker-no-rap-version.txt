Jay Z:

Mariah: We're gonna do it like this

Jigga 

Mariah: 
Gimme your love, gimme your love 
Gimme your love, gimme your love 

Jay Z: 
Aight 
You gotta bounce to this like this 
You almost kinda watching this 
Aha, whooo 
Escape 

Mariah: 
Boy your love's so good 
I don't wanna let go 
And although I should 
I can't leave you alone 
Cause you're so disarming 
I'm caught up in the midst of you 
And I cannot resist at all 
Boy if I do 
The things you wanna to 
The way I used to do 
Could you love me baby 
You leave me feelin used 
Cause you go and break my heart 

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me 
I should have known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart 
Gimme your love, gimme your love 
Gimme your love, gimme your love 

It's a shame to be 
So euphoric and weak 
When you smile at me 
And you tell me the things 
That you know persuade me 
To relinquish my love to you 
But I cannot resist 
At all 
Boy if I do 
The things you wanna to 
The way I used to do 
Would you love me baby 
You leave me feelin used 
Cause you go and break my heart 

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me 
I should have known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart 

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me 
I should have known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart 

Gimme your love, gimme your love 
Gimme your love, gimme your love 

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me 
I should have known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart 

Gimme your love, gimme your love 
Gimme your love, gimme your love
