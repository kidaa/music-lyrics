Mariah: 
Baby don't tell me 
You miss me, you love me 
Don't whisper gently 
That you can forget me 
Tonight, tonight 
'Cause I heard it all before 
Just turn away, don't play that game 
Baby I don't want to anymore 

Let it all fade away 
Don't you know the love is gone 
It's to late 
Everything fades away 
Nothing ever stays the same 
Baby, no no no 

Don't tell me you're sorry 
You hurt me 
How many times can I give in 
How many battles can you win 
Oh don't beg for mercy 
Tonight, tonight 
'Cause I can't take anymore 
Just turn around, don't break me down 
Baby I don't love you like before 

Let it all fade away 
Don't you know the love is gone 
It's to late 
Everything fades away 
Nothing ever stays the same 
Baby, no no no 

CR: 
So hard for me to let you go 
Don't leave me staying in the cold 
Oh baby give it one more chance 
I know that we can make it last 
Just let me love you one more time 
Mariah: Don't say it 
I don't wanna lose my mind 
Mariah: Don't say it baby 
So hard for me to let you go 
So hard for me to let you go 

Let it all fade away 
Don't you know the love is gone 
It's to late 
Everything fades away 
Nothing ever stays the same 
Baby, no no no 

Mariah: 
It only fades, it only fades 
Baby don't tell me 
It only fades, it only fades 
You miss me, you love me
