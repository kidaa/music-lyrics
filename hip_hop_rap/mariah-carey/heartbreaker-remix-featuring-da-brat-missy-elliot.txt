[Mariah] 
Honey they can't do it like this 
Just play the record 

[Da Brat] 
Guess who's back in the muther****** house 
With two big tigglebitties for your mouth 
Heartbreakers must partake in the sensation 
So So Def and Clue, hits in the making 

[Missy] 
Oh guess who's driving the five double O 
Like Yipi-Yi Yipi-Yo, yeah 
When I talk smack y'all better skip back 
Like here we go, cause the b**** don't play 

[Mariah] 
Ooh your love's so good 
I don't wanna let go 
Even though I should 
I can't leave you alone 
Cause you're so disarming 
I'm caught up in the midst of you 
And I can not resist, oh 

2 - [Mariah] 
Boy if I do 
The things you want me to 
The way I used to do 
Would you love me baby 
Holding me, feeling me or would you go and break my heart 

3 - [Mariah] 
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
But I just keep coming back incessantly 
Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
I should of known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart 

3 - I need someone to give me some real love 

Repeat 3 till second verse 

[Mariah] 
Why, when I met you that night baby 
It no way wouldn't last 
I gave my love then you hurt me 
Which I've been taking over 

See I have never met a guy 
And I was withdrawn to the lies 
Should've know you'd break my heart 

[Da Brat] 
Come on, yeah, yeah, uh, uh, come on, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, uh 
Come on 
Well if the Brat gave a f*** about a nigga 
My heart would be broke 
Should of know you were star struck 
When I left your stroke 
My guards were up in the beginning 
But then I gave you my heart and you broke it again 
I'm a fool when you smile, I'm convinced 
I get caught up in you and I just can't resist 
I know you lie to me, it just drive me nuts 
That one kiss could persuade me to believe your bluffs 
You set it up and impressed me with pimps and rings 
I wish love was dollars cause money ain't a thang 
Cause Clueminati and MC move the party 
I got a heater ready to blaze somebody 
It's that dummy you, it's that for each member of my crew 
In fact, I'ma heartbreak you 
Lay you flat on your back 
You really don't know 
So I'd advise you not to trust me no 

[Missy] 
Yo, yo 
Baby, I the real thing 
So why you got me sweating you consistently baby 
Baby, I got that good thing 
So while you're making love to me you crazy baby 
Oh! 

[Missy] 
I like the way he used to spank me 
He used to lie me on my back take that! 
He used to have me in the sack, legs back 
But now he been buggin' lately 
Hey boy why you actin' stinky 
I keep ya stiff like wood baby 
So if you wanna keep a good lady 
You need to stop with all the heartbreaking 

Repeat 2 

Repeat 2   3 till end
