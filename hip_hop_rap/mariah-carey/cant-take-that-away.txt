They can say anything they want to say  
Try to bring me down  
But I will not allow  
Anyone to succeed  
Hanging clouds over me  
And they can try hard to make me feel  
That I don't matter at all 
But I refuse to falter 
In what I believe  
Or lose faith in my dreams  

CHORUS:  
'Cause there's a light in me 
That shines brightly 
They can try  
But they can't take that away from me  
From me  

They can do anything they want to you  
lf you let them in  
But they won't ever win  
If you cling to your pride  
And just push them aside  
See  
I have learned there's an inner peace I own  
Something in my soul  
That they cannot possess  
So I won't be afraid  
And darkness will fade  

'Cause there's a light in me  
That shines brightly  
They can try  
But they can't take that away from me  

No  
They can't take this  
Precious love  
I'll always have inside me  
Certainly the Lord will guide me  
Where I need to go  

They can say anything they want to say  
Try to break me down  
But 1 won't face the ground  
I will rise steadily  
Sailing out of their reach  

Oh Lord  
They do try hard to make me feel  
That I don't matter at all  
But I refuse to falter  
In what I believe  
Or lose faith in my dreams  

'Cause there's a light in me that shines brightly  
They can try  
But they can't take that away from me  
From me
