I don't wanna live without your love 
I don't wanna live without your love 
Hm 
Hey yeah 

I can't imagine 
Looking in someone else's eyes 
What we have surpasses 
Even paradise 
It's hard to fathom 
Reaching for someone else's hand 
What we share is magic 
Heaven had a plan 

Sent from up above 
Sent from up above 
So much love 
In my life 
Hooo, hooo 
I can't get enough 
Just can't get enough 
Of your touch-feels so right 

Unending passion 
Somehow the fire never dies 
What we share 
Is everlasting 
Love without demise 
Oh yes 
He made it happen 
Placed so much joy into our hands 
What we dreamed 
We finally captured 
Heaven took command 

Sent from up above 
Sent from up above 
So much love 
In my life 
Hooo, hooo 
I can't get enough 
Just can't get enough 
Of your touch-feels so right
