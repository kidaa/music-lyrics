I like that

Honey you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who
Makes me come running
'Cause what you got is
Far beyond compare

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you cryin' for you I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

I can't be elusive
With you honey
Because it's a blatant
That I'm feeling you
And it's so hard for me
To leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing
I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you cryin' for you I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
