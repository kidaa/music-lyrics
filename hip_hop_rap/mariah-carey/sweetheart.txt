Boy have'nt you noticed
A gleam in my eye
Because of you
I'm a littie hypnotized
But everytime you're with me
I feel so positive
Now with a little love
Something's got to give.

a full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me.

baby, wont you be my sweetheart
we could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
What you think about, what you think about you and me baby going one on one
just you andi.

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
i'm so in love with you
But each romantic ending
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore.

Repeat Bridge

Repeat Chorus.

Stars are bright
Mood is right
say what MC baby sing it to me
To keep me warm away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms

Repeat Chorus

Let's get together
Live happily ever after
No one to make us sad
Oh baby
You know i need your love
Romance
