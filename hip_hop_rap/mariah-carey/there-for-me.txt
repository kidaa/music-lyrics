I'd never have known the way it feels to love 
Without the love you showered down upon me 
Warm, warm as the sun melting away the rain 
Giving me strength to face another morning 

So many times I felt afraid 
And turned to you to find my way 
I reach inside and find you there 
You are with me everywhere 

Oh, it would take all, all of my life to find 
Someone more there for me, there for me 
And I'm never alone, cause in my heart I know 
You're always there for me, there for me 

I, I won't let go, of precious memories 
They are the light of hope that burns inside me 
And every time I lose my way you shine for me and I'm okay 
You lift me way beyond it all and you never let me fall 

Oh, it would take all, all of my life to find 
Someone more there for me, there for me 
And I'm never alone, cause in my heart I know 
You're always there for me, there for me 

You'll always catch me when I fall 

Oh, it would take all, all of my life to find 
Someone more there for me, there for me 
And I'm never alone, cause in my heart I know 
You're always there for me, there for me 
My love 

You're always there for me
