feat. O.D.B.

Keeping it real son
That's right
The shining star
My shining star, girl

Yo New York in the house
Is Brooklyn in the house
Uptown in the house
Dallas are you in the house
Boogie down are you in the house
Sacramento in the house
Atlanta, Georgia are you in the house
West Coast are you in the house
Japan are you in the house
Everybody are you in the house
Baby baby come on
Baby come on
Baby come on

Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet sweet

[Chorus:]
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping
Sweet fantasy
Sweet fantasy

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

[Chorus]

Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing the ol' dirty doggy

Here we go now
Me and Mariah
Go back like babies with pacifiers
Ol' dirty dog no liar
Kickin' fantasy hot like fire
Jump jump
And let me see you do the stump
Girls let me see you shake your rump
Brothers get in from the back and pump
And let's do it do it do the hump

I'm a little bit country
I'm a little bit rock
And I'm soul to soul
Big letters all big and bold
Ol' Dirty Bastard across the globe

[Chorus]

What you gonna do when you get out of jail
I'm gonna do a remix
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
I'm gonna do a remix
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
I'm gonna have some fun
What you gonna do when you get out of jail
I'm gonna have some fun

[Chorus]
