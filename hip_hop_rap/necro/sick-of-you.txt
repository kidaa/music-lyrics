Yeah yo
All you bitch ass niggas
Shady mothafuckers
[Chorus]
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
[Verse 1]
I'm sick of you I need robitusin, don't make me start bustin'
You so depressed, you can't let me enjoy your minute
You make me sick, like I ate food with poison in it
You played out, you're too repetitive
Give me a sedative before my brain gets negative 
and I get the fever for the flavour of a ?_shankin'_?
Right in the throat G, 'cause on your bullshit I've O'd
I've had it! You lying in the habit like a teenager in tablets
Lighting carrots and rabbits, automatics and religious fanatics
[Chorus]
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
fucking bitch
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
Pass me the ?_excedury_? before I bash your fuckin' head in
[Verse 2]
I ain't feelin' you, the only thing I'm feels is an allergic reaction
Pass the medication, you got me sick like a patient
Digesting your ?_reconversation_?
Shut the fuck up 'cause I'm not patient 
But I'm mental, you might catch laceration
Wanna be hard rock, STOP
Play at your age, I'm sick from you pussy
?_Like I fucked all y'all at age_?
My stomach feeling obscure, the only cure is a knife ending your dick
Suck and enjoy it, stop you from rapping 'cause your style's poor
[Chorus]
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
Pass me an advil before I make you travel below some gravel
[Verse 3]
I get nauseated, from a ?_d-day with a wack pay lift_?,
And crushin' six hours of lookin' at his dick can ?_balift_?
Criminal porters like a virus clinic, 'cause I'm sick
Once I'm in it, the disease called annoying grows each minute
Go get your own style, you ain't sick enough
Yo I got a headache son, 'cause you suckin' my dick to much
And that's the only way shit like you will grow up
My acid lunch, eat you up, you make you wanna throw up
[Chorus]
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
I'm sick of you
*scratching*
Hand me a butt from before you fuckin' snuff it
Bitch! I'm fucking sick of you!
Fucking bitch ass motherfuckers, shady sluts!
WHAT!
