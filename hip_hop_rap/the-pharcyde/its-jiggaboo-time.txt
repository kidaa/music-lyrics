Aiyyo yo yo I tell you what's up I tell you tell you tell you what's up
When you sign a crossed line, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time yo what?, it's jiggaboo time
When you're runnin out of lyrics, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
Yo, when you rappin for the money, it's jiggaboo time what?
It's jiggaboo time what?, it's jiggaboo time
When you don't have a plan, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
You're rappin for the white man, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
When you don't have soul, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
Nigga when there's pork in your bowl, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
Lots and lots of pork in your bowl, jiggaboo time
A real big bowl of fat, wait a minute wait a minute
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
It's jiggaboo time, it's jiggaboo time
*fades into background*
Aowwowwwwww!  Show me them teeth babyyy!
OK could you bug your eyes just a little bit?
Yeah, straighten that ass out
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. I mean you know, real ghetto
OK we'll shoot the video over here
We need umm like a street area, y'know, toothless
and homeless, wearin gold chains, all that shit

But we're all jiggaboos -- in our owwwwwwn wayyyyyy
        So, might as well just get paid, and say, fuckit, y'know
