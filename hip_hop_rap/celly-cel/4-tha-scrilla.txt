Have you ever been lost?
Didn't want your direction
That was your intention
Are you free can you see
All the things that surround you?
Let them astound you

Let yourself believe in mystery
When you find yourself in another galaxy
Go beyond the limits of sanity
Expand your mind
Secret hideaways are awaiting you
If you challenge all the fears that wont allow you to
Intimidate yourself with something new

Wou Uh wou uh Wow

Take a look around and see beyond the things you can't imagine
Use more than just your eyes
Senses can hypnotize
Take a look around and go beyond the limits if you haven't
Let go and breathe it in
Let the record spin

When in France don't just dance
Kick back relax and enjoy your favorite souffl
