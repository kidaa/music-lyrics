I must've had a million damn unlucky days
But there ain't no cloud that a bottle can't chase away
I've done my deal of living, ran from place to place
But when the roof comes in I don't wanna take it straight

They say with faith any soul can make it
But hell, why should I wait
'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade

I've had my share of heartaches, let downs and tricks
But the everyday blues is the one thing I can fix
I've heard those holy brethren muttering my name
But it ain't no sin to drink when you're suffering

Patience, they say, is a saintly virtue
But hell, why should I wait
'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade
When every heavy sky just empties on your fate
Sometimes keeping dry's something to celebrate

So if the road of sin is the one I'm taking
I ain't gonna stray
'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade
