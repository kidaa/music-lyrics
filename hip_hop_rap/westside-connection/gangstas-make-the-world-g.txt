ICE CUBE
Iam gettin dizzy as the world keeps spinnin like
a frisbie
Gangsta's and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what Im facin
but give me 7 seas and 11 gees
I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its
knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the empire state building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But nigga's in school is scared of the Goodfellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fuckin move untill I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna
be
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya honor Im have to get rid of ya
Because it aint no trivia about my house in WEST BOLIVIA
Blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Them swim the big fish
YOU fuckin guppies!!!!!!!!

Mack 10360 degrees like my D's the world be spinning
Nigga's been sinning since the beginning
Historys a trip so I peep when Iam reading
Nigga's probaly grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big ballin sex cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandolaus biting forbidden
fruit
But gangsta's dont deal with that shit, on the
Westside
And since they regulating hoes I roll with the
Best side
So check it as my lifetime is ticking
Coming up strong  licking and flipping chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need
to make your order
Everything to baggies triple beams to jugs for
my water
like a snitch lifes a bitch a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song on your way to killa king
nigga
So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole
life span
Cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on thses prankstas
While the world keep twisting as a Westside 
Gangsta
FOE LIFE NIGGA
