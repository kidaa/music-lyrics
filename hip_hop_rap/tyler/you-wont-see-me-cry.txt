So many times before
You just walked out my door
I'm telling you I can't take anymore
Everytime you make it happen
Feel so sad and cold inside
Don't you miss my tender love
Temptation is knocking, but you can fight it

You won't see me cry Please baby, baby come home
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby come home
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby

I'm begging you not to go now
Please don't go away
I just can't take all this heartache
Baby please stay
Everytime you make it happen
Feel so sad and cold inside
Don't you miss my tender love
Temptation is knocking, but you can fight it

You won't see me cry Please baby, baby come home
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby come home
You won't see me cry I miss you like crazy come on home

INSTRUMENTAL

You won't see me cry Please baby, baby come home
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby
You won't see me cry Please baby, baby come home
You won't see me cry I'm begging you baby come on home
