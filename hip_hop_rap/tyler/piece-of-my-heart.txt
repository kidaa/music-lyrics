Written by J. Ragovoy and B. Berns

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can
Love- But with all the love I give ya
It ain't never enough
Well, I'm gonna show ya baby that a woman can be tough
So, come on, come on, come on, come on

Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now honey
You can have it
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it, it it makes ya feel good

You're out on the street looking old
And ya know deep down in your heart that it ain't right
No, Ya never hear me when I cry at night
Though I tell myself that I can't stand my pain
But when Ya hold me in your arms, I'm singing again
So, come on, come on, come on, come on

Repeat chorus X 2
