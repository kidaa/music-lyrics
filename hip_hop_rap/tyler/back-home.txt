Written by Dieter Bohlen

I'd be alone again
A thousand voices call to me
A cry that splits the night
Woke up a soul inside
My memory
I chose to walk along
To search and find my destiny
So many lonesome roads
Keep me away from where
I long to be 
I lie awake and see a cold and empty room
I sit alone and think of places I once knew
Of friends that I had loved and left behind
Oh how could I have been so blind

Chorus
Back home
Where all the love is that I need
Where my family waits for me
Back home
Back home
I close my eyes and I would see
Where the river meets the sea
Back home
There is no better place than home to me
My home is where I find my destiny

Instrumental

I'm going home again
And I just can't wait to see
Old folks that I have missed
A mother's tender kiss
So soft, so sweet
I'll hold her in my arms
Like I'd never left my home
My families my home
Now I'll tell them that 
I miss them so
I know I've been away so very long
That I hurt you when I left and I was wrong
And I see that home is where my heart belongs
So hang on heart cause here I come

Chorus X 2
