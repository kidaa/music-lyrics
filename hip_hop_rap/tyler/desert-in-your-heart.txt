Sung with Sophia Apbanith

You're Moving Better From the Face Than To Escape From the World That Is Waiting
You'll Pay the Price When You Know the Words Are Killing the Meanings
There Is No Way To Hide In the Dark When You're Fussing and Fighting
How Can You Dream In a World That Is Getting Greyer and Greyer

You Don't Have To Hide Your Face
There's No Disgrace
There's No Harm In Knowing You're All Apart of the Human Race
You Have Got To Lift Your Head
Forgive What He Said
You Were Born To Know That You've Got Nothing But What You Give To This World

chorus
The Desert Is In Your Heart
In Your Heart
The Desert Is In Your Heart
In Your Heart

It Is So Hard To Try To Forget
So Many Things That You Regret
You Try To Look Back
But There's Little To See
Just Nothing Can Take This Pain From Me
