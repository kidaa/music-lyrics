I put my trust in you, cause I'm not the suspicious kind
But it seems to me that there's someone on your mind
Maybe I'm wrong, and maybe there's some mistake
But I won't take any chances, I'm watching every mover you make
I never felt so scared and helpless before
I wish I could believe in you, but I just gotta be sure

You're under suspicion
All the time
You're under suspicion
All the time Yeah

When we talk I can see you can't look me straight in the eye
What's all the secrecy, you've got me wondering why
Is there someone you met, to make you regret your decision
How could you forget all our plans and all our ambitions
Don't try to pull the wool right over my eyes
You think you're pretty smart, but I can see right through your disguise

You're under suspicion
All the time, time, yeah
You're under suspicion 
All the time oh
