Written by Scott and Wolfe

I'm a woman
In hell beyond
Locked together
Living on a lonely start
But we can stay here
Like the mountains do
Like the leaves we tumble
But baby before we do, before we do

Let the show begin
Let the orchestra play
Let the dancers in
and we'll dance the night away
Let the show begin
Get me lost in your kiss
If we don't remember anything
We'll sure remember this
If we don't remember anything
We'll sure remember this

Who am I love
Who are you
Locked together
Wondering where we're going to
An old man told me
How his life just flew
And the years went quickly
But baby before they do, before they do

Let the show begin
Let the carnival start
Let the dancers in
Take your partners to your heart
Let the show begin 
Let the orchestra play
If we don't remember anything
We won't forget today
If we don't remember anything
We won't forget today

Instrumental

Let the show begin
Get me lost in your kiss
If we don't remember anything
We'll sure remember this
If we don't remember anything
We'll sure remember this
