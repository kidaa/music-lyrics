I'm turned around and lost out here again
Feeling like there's no way out and without you no way in
Where are you my friend?
I know how hard it is to keep from crying out loud
To look up in the sky and see nothing but clouds
The last thing you said "you know my hope never dies"
No matter how dark it was you always saw the blue skies

Oh I'm sick and tired of yesterday
I think of all the times I chose the worst things and I threw the best away
What would you say?
I know how hard it is to keep from crying out loud
To look up in the sky and see nothing but clouds
The last thing you said "you know my hope never dies"
No matter how dark it was you always saw the blue skies

I just hope this road keeps turning 
'Til I find a place to end this yearning

Where are you my friend?
You know how hard it is to keep from crying out loud
To look up in the sky and see nothing but clouds
The last thing you said "you know my hope never dies"
No matter how dark it was you always saw the blue skies

No matter how dark it was you always saw the blue skies
No matter how dark it was you always saw the blue skies
