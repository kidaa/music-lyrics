Written by Scott and Wolfe

If you want my love
You've only got to take it
And if you get my heart
Do anything but break it

And if you want to know the truth
I think about you all night
And whatever I am doing
You're never out of my mind

chorus
Whoa, I believe in your sweet love
Whoa, I believe in your sweet love

There's a way you've got
Something in the mixture
As the night goes on
You could become a fixture

Chorus

I believe
Oh, I believe

If you want my love
You've only got to take it
And if you get my heart
Do anything but break it

Chorus/I believe, I believe back and forth
