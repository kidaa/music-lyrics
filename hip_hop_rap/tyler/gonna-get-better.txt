Written by Tyler and Hopkins

I sat here alone
Here in my one room home
No one comes round no more
No one knocks on my door
Was high and came the fall
The tax man took it all
I didn't play the rules
I was a careless fool

Chorus
But it's gonna get better
Feel it in my bones
Just got to hold you
Cause I 'm all alone
I need to touch you
Need you here to stay
This time I'll never let you get away
Never, ever gonna let you get away

They laughed at all my jokes
Look around where are those crazy folks
I think of real good times
Those wasted partying lines

Instrumental

Just bring your lovin' home
Don't waste love on the phone
I love you yes it's true
Hell's what I've been going through
They'll be more ups than downs
Please make that turn around
Now that we've plyed the ways
You're coming home to stay

Chorus X 2
