I walked down to the river
Stood on the shore
Seems like the devils always trying to get in my door
Just when I thought I couldn't take anymore
Here you come again, my friend

He keeps sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
Teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you

As I stand on this mountain
Face to the wind
Amazed by the number of times we've all sinned
Countless enemies, that could've been friends
Lord, here it comes again

He keeps sending me angels
Here they come a flying
He keeps sending me angels
To keep me from crying
He keeps sending me angels
So I'll never be blue
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you

He keeps sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
Teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
So I'll never be blue
He keeps sending me angels 
Just like you

Some say that it's coming
Say he's already here
But love is a marytr through the joy and the fear
When I look in your eyes
Everything is so clear
My friend, here it comes again

He keeps sending me angels
Here they come a flying
He keeps sending me angels
To keep me from crying
He keeps sending me angels
So I'll never be blue
He keeps sending me angels
Just like you

He keeps sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
To teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
Sweet and true
He keeps sending me angels
He keeps sending me angels
From up on high
He keeps sending me angels
Teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels
Sweet and true
Sending me angels
Sending me angels
Here they come a flying
He keeps sending me angels
Keep me from crying
