Written by Scott and Wolfe

I can't help if if the world is going crazy
And the headlines get more frightening everyday
Just as long as I'm in there with you, baby
It's ok, it's ok

Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby, I need you now
Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby, I need you now
Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby, I need you now
Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby, I need you now

I don't usually really talk about my feelings
But with you there's such a lot I want to say
And as long as your the one that I believe in
It's ok, it's ok

Repeat chorus

Instrumental

And as long as your the one that I believe in
It's ok, it's ok

Repeat chorus X 2 then fade
