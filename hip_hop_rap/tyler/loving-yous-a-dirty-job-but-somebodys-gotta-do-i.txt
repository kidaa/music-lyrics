Girl:  When the sky is falling and you're looking round
       For somewhere to hide
       Did you ever call out to someone
       Did you ever call out to me, I've never been gone-
       I've been right here by your side
       There ain't nothin' but clouds
       There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes

       Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth
       You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth
       Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most
       You're so busy trying to get even 
       You never even try to get close

       I can't explain it away
       It doesn't make any sense
       To know what it's like
       I guess you gotta go through it
       It doesn't matter baby
       Loving you's a dirty job
       But somebody's gotta do it

 Boy:  There were times when we'd never fake it
       There were times when we'd always make it
       There were times when we'd take it to the limit
       And we'd never, never, ever leave each other alone
       We wee flesh and blood and bone
       There were times we had it all
       There were times we had it all

Both   There were times when we took our chances
alt :  There were times we were damn good dancers
       There were times when we heard all the answers
       In the beating of the drummer
       And the riches of the rock and the roll
       I can see right through your soul
       There were times we had it all
       There were times we had it all

 Boy:  If your fears could only be forgotten
       We could pull all the barriers down
       Would you follow your dream's desire
       Would you follow your secret dreams
       And forbidden fire
       Let's just peel out of this town

Both:  It's been nothing but dreams
       It's been nothing but dreams until now
Boy :  You're never gonna see it
Both:  You got your head stuck in the sand
Boy :  It's the land of the free and easy street
Girl:  It's the home of the damned
Boy :  You're never gonna see it
Both:  You better open up your eyes
Girl:  You're the only one who's left
Both:  Who's gonna believe all your lies

Boy :  I can't explain it away
       It doesn't make any sense
Both:  To know what it's like
       I guess you gotta go through it 
       It doesn't matter baby
Girl:  Loving you's a dirty job
       But somebody's gotta do it

Boy :  There were times when our bodies glistened
       There were times that we can't stop missing
       There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
Both:  To the pounding, pounding chorus
       Of our desperate hearts
       Nothing could have torn us apart
       There were times we had it all
       There were times we had it all 

Girl:  There were times when we fought like tigers
       There were times we were damn good liars
Boy :  There were times we extinguished every fire
Both:  That was burning, burning, burning, up each other alive
       From the heavens on down to the dives
       There were times we lost it all
       There were times we lost it all

       There were times when we fought like tigers
       There were times we were damn good liars

Both:  There were times when our bodies glistened
       There were times that we can't stop missing
       There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
       To the pounding, pounding, chorus of our desperate hearts
       Nothing could have torn us apart
       There were times we had it all
       There were times we had it all
