Written by Harold Faltermeyer

verse one

Somewhere inside is burning
I don't know why it's hurting
Hoping for just one sign in your eyes
That tells me you will be staying

Where can I go to find you
What must I do to feel you
I was looking but too blind to see
You were there right by my side

chorus

Say Goodbye, I'll never forget
Say goodbye, I'll be leaving today
Say goodbye, Our heart's gonna beat bold together
Cause we'll, we'll find a way - one day

verse two

What can I do to hold you
How did I know I love you
Never found that our hearts felt the same
Till the cold light of day stole our dreams

chorus x 2

We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way
