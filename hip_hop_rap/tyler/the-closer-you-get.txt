Written by Chris Rea

The street lights start to come on
I know that it's time
Stop what your doing
Meet those drinking friends of mine
First guy that calls me on the telephone says
Get on down, but I'm staying at home
Now I believe in love
I believe that it's true
Then I'm defenseless when I'm looking at you
Sleepy eyes on an angel's face
Don't worry baby, no one's gonna take your place

chorus
The closer you get, the better you look
Throw me a line
Ah, the closer you get, the more that I see
We'll sure have a good time
Now I know what you're thinking
How do I feel?
Well there's no rules in my book
Said the closer you get, oh, oh, the better you look

Instrumental

Keep one foot in the showroom and one on the side
I've had some close ones, but I'm doing alright
There's gold on his finger, it don't mean a thing
He'll do his best to hear this sweet lady sing
I've got the time if you've got the place
We've got he know how if you've got the space
We've got the power, we've got no shame
Come over baby, sure do want to light your flame

Chorus

Instrumental
