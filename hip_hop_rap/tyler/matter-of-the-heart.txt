If it was a matter of money
You'd be in by now
She'd be lying by your side
You'd be thinking loves door has opened wide
You feel defeated
but your acting proud
Would you try to hide
She doesn't care how you're coming on
You know all that matters
Is that your love is strong

Chorus
It's a matter of the heart
It's a matter of the soul
You know good love only starts
When you start to loose control
If she's calling out your name
And she needs you in the night
You gotta run into the flames
Till your blinded by the light
You've got to take her in your arms
And let her know
She'll always be your spark
It's the fundamental text
Just a matter of the heart

You thought she'd swallow
All the tales you told
Ready to believe
You're so together
There's nothing you can do, no
But first impressions 
Were to leave her cold
It isn't what she needs
She doesn't care about the world you planned
But she'll run to you
If you understand

Chorus

Chorus

It's a matter of the heart
It's a matter of the heart
It's a matter of the heart
