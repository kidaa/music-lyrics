Duet with Shakin' Stevens

Written by C.Otis, B. Benton, L. Dejesus

Bonnie: If you're gonna give me good kisses like that
        Honey don't you know I'm gonna give 'em right back
        Cause that's a kissin' good way
        That's a kissin' good way
        That's a kissin' good way
        That's a kissin' good way
        That's a kissin' good way to mess around and fall in love
        Don't mess around
        Don't mess around

 Shaky: If you're gonna start out hugging me tight
        Don't mess around come and hug me right
        Cause that's a huggin' good way
        That's a huggin' good way
        That's a huggin' good way
        That's a huggin' good way
        That's a huggin' good way to mess around and fall in love
        Don't mess around
        Don't mess around

Bonnie: You know you called me on the phone
        Yeah I got your number
        And just because I was alone
        Ah, you came around a-wooing
        Why not?
        You better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doing

 Shaky: Now that you've kissed me and you rocked my soul
        Don't come around knockin' rock and roll
        Cause that's a rocking good way
        That's a rockin' good way
        That's a rockin' good way
        That's a rockin' good way
        That's a rocking good way to mess around and fall in love
        Don't mess around
        Don't mess around

 Shaky: Well, now you called me on the phone
        Yeah baby
        And just because I was alone
        You came around a-wooing
        You better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doing

Bonnie: Now that you've kissed me and you rocked my soul
        Don't come around knockin' rock and roll
        Cause that's a rockin' good way 
        That's a rockin' good way
        That's a rockin' good way
        That's a rockin' good way
        That's a rockin' good way to mess around and fall in love
        Don't mess around
        Don't mess around

Bonnie: It's a rockin' good way
 Shaky: It's a rockin' good way
  Both: It's a rockin' good way to mess around and fall in love
