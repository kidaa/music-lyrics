Written by Dieter Bohlen

Grew up together in the neighborhood
She never noticed that he looked so good
He told her all I do is dream of you oh yeah
No, she had never seen 
In her wildest dreams
Blue eyes that gleam just like James Dean

Big plans their make in a small hometown
N chance to leave would really bring him down
A crazy rebel with a cause, he was for sure  oh yeah
No, she had never seen 
In her wildest dreams
Blue eyes that gleam just like James Dean

He writes her letters from around the world
Says he loves her and she's still his girl
Maybe he'll come back, don't know when
Oh she'll never see her baby again

He's got the whole world in his hands
And she was Alice in his wonderland
Oh they had dreams, but now he has it all yeah
No, she had never seen
In her wildest dreams
Blue eyes that gleam just like James Dean

She was the diamond of his eyes
And she would always be right by his side
But good guys only win in the movies yeah
No, she had never seen
In her wildest dreams
Blue eyes that gleam just like James Dean

He writes her letters from around the world
Says he loves her and she's still his girl
Maybe he'll come back, he don't know when
Oh she'll never see her baby again
