Written by Stuart Emerson

A long night
Cutting through the desert heat
The sun was rising
The day was standing on it's feet
I saw a long shadow snakin' down
the dusty road side
To where you were standing
Waiting for the big ride

A vision in black no holding back
I pulled in along side
Drove till night falling light
The time has come to pay the price

Your diving me wild
Driving me wild
You turn me upside down
turn me around
You make me feel so good
Your driving me wild

Everyone loves a mystery
Everyone loves to dream
A real cliffhanger
A real good thriller
But how about love for real

There's a god in the sky 
Coz we made it all night
The warm river flowing inside
But the river ran dry
As day went by
He couldn't wait to say goodbye

Your driving me wild
Driving me wild
Your turn me upside down
You turn me around
You make me feel so good
Your driving me wild

Everyone loves a mystery

Your driving me wild
Driving me wild
