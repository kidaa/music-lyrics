Written by Scott and Wolfe

I'm just a woman, you are the only man
I need you always, you need me now and then
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

I'm just a puppet, you make me dance and sing
You know I love it, letting you pull the string
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

chorus
And I know
If you chose
You could throw me away like some old shoes
But as long
As your there
From the bottom of my heart I don't care

I'm just a lover, you walk along the way
I try to do it, but you always start the play
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

Chorus

I'm just a woman, ooh
I'm just a woman, ooh

And there are times you really show
Whats in your heart and then I know
No matter what you do, I can't let go
Baby part of your love

I'm just a woman, you are the only man
I need you always, you need me now and then
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

chorus

Ooh, I'm just a woman, ooh
I'm just a woman, ooh
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

I'm just a woman
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

I'm just a woman
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman, just a woman
You are the only man

Just a woman
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman, you are the only man

Just a woman
I said I'm just a woman, you are the only man

Yeah
I'm just a woman, you are the only man
I'm just a woman
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman, you, you're the only man
