Written by Tom Petty

Well it was out in California
By the San Diego Sea
That was when I was taken in
And it left its mark on me
Yeah it nearly drove me crazy
Cause I felt I had no choice
Yeah it seemed that I was only marking time
With all those sailor boys

Louisiana Rain is falling at my feet
I'm noticing a change
As I move down the street
Louisiana Rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same
When I reach Baton Rouge

South Carolina put out its arms for me
Right up until everything went black
Somewhere on a lonely street
And I still can't quite remember
Who helped me to my feet
But thank God for this long neck bottle
The angel's remedy

Louisiana Rain is falling just like tears
Running down my face
Washing out the years
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same 
When I reach Baton Rouge

Well I never will get over
This English refugee
Singing to the Juke box in some
All-Nite Beanery
Yeah he was eating hard rock candy
And chasing it with tea
You sure should have seen him lick his lips
When he looked up at me

Louisiana rain is falling at my feet
And I'm noticing a change
As I move down the street
Louisiana rain is soaking through my shoes
I may never be the same
When I reach Baton Rouge
