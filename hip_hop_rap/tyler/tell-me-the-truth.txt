Written by Dieter Bohlen

I told you once I told you twice
This love is not a sacrifice
Oh take my heart and don't be a dreamer
Oh tears may go and years may come
See my heart look what you've done
Oh take my heart and don't be a dreamer
Oh don't be a dreamer who's killing my heart

Tell me the truth
Time's on my side
Oh baby give it one more try
Tell me the truth no compromise
Only a strong love will survive 
I never tear apart
It's written in my heart
I'll never ever hurt you

I wasted days, I wasted nights
A restless love, an endless fight
Oh take my heart and don't be a dreamer
My world begins and ends with you
A breathless love painted in blue
Oh take my heart and don't be a dreamer
Oh don't be a dreamer who's killing my heart

Tell me the truth
Time's on my side
Oh baby give it one more try
Tell me the truth no compromise
Only a strong love will survive
I never tear apart
It's written in my heart
I'll never ever hurt you

Oh baby

Tell me the truth
Time's on my side
Oh baby I stay by your side
Tell me the truth no compromise
Only a strong love will survive
Tell me the truth'
Time's on my side
Oh baby I stay by your side
Tell me the truth
