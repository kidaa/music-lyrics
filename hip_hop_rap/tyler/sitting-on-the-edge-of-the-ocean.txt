Written by Scott and Wolfe

You asked me to come
And so here  I am
Has everything gone
According to plan
Don't know what to say
But something still burns
As soon as we touch again
That feeling returns
A little confused
But better by far
To be lovers again
Cause that's what we are

chorus
It's like I'm sitting on the edge of the ocean
Walking a very fine line
Playing my cards on the table
Got to be honest this time
I'm just sitting on the edge of the ocean
Telling it all to the sea
Baby you know that I love you
But I want you to know that I'm me

I knew him before
Before I met you
He was my first love
So what could I do
I've opened my heart
Now you know it all
You want me to stay
You've only to call

Chorus then fade
