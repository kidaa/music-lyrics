Written by Stuart Emerson

I think time and motion just stood still
I feel like the hours are there to kill
Now for the first time in my life

I am right where I wanna be
I'm closing the door on what I used to be
Now for the first time in my life

I have to hold on
The feelings too strong
I shake like a leaf
I tremble inside

It's gonna take, all night to know 
All night to know, all night to know you well
It's gonna take, all night to know you
All night to know you, all night to know you 

Inside the room it's cold and dark
The nightime won't sleep till we give our hearts
Now for the first time in my life

I have to hold on
The feelings too strong
I shake like a leaf
I tremble inside

It's gonna take, all night to know
All night to know, all night to know you well
It's gonna take, all night to know you
All night to know you, all night to know you

All night to know you

It's gonna take, all night to know
All night to know, all night to know you well
It's gonna take, all night to know you
All night to know you, all night to know you
