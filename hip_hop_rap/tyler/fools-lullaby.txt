Baby when I lost you, my heart stood still
Oh baby when I kissed you gave me such a thrill
Ooh, I'm far away from home
Oh baby when I touched you felt a shiver on my skin
Oh baby oh I love you, this loves not a sin
Ooh, I'm far away from home
I'm so alone
Far away from home

chorus
Oh it's a fools lullaby
Oh I never meant to make you cry
We can make a better life
Don't make my blue eyes lie
Oh, it's a fools lullaby
I gave you all the best years of my life
Baby take another chance
And give it one more try

Oh baby if you call me, I'll be there
Whatever happens baby, we just won't care
Ooh, I'm far away from home
Oh baby take my heart, let's heal the pain
Take me in your arms, make love again
Ooh, I'm far away from home
I'm so alone
Far away from home
