Written by Scott and Wolfe

Take me out of the mood I'm in, I don't care what you do
I'm just glad that the one I'm with is you
I don't know what I want to say, only know how I feel
Tomorrow is more than a mile away from here

Oh, Don't stop the music, I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now, No, no, no, no
Don't stop the music, I need some romance
Don't stop the music , not now

I don't know where I'm going to, I don't know that I care
It's one of those nights when the music takes me there
Take me out of the mood I'm in, dance me out of my mind
It's one of those nights that I just can't leave behind

Oh, Don't stop the music, I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now, no, no, no, no
Don't stop the music, I need some romance
Don't stop the music, not now

Oh, don't stop the music, I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now, no, no, no, no
Don't stop the music, I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now

Oh, don't stop the music, I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now, no, no, no, no
Don't stop the music, I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now
