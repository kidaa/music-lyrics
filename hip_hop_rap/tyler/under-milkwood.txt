Polly Garter's song:

I loved a man whose name was Tom
He was strong as a bear and two yards long
I loved a man whose name was dick
He was big as a barrel and three feet thick

And I loved a man whose name was Harry
Six feet tall and sweet as a cherry
But the one I loved best a wake or aslepp
Was little Willy Wee and he's six feet deep

Oh Tom Dick and Harry were three fine man
And I'll never have such loving again
But little Willy Wee who took me on his knee
Little Willy Wee was the man for me

Now men from every parish round
Run after me and roll me on the ground
But whenever I loved another man back
Johnnie from the Hill or Sailing Jack

I always think as they do what they please
of Tom Dick Harry whore were tall as trees
And most I think when I'm by their side
Of Little Willy Wee who downed and died

Oh Tom Dick and Harry were three fine man
And I'll never have such loving again
But little Willy Wee who took me on his knee
Little Willy Wee was the man for me

Tom Dick and Harry were three fine men
and I'll never have such      again

And I'll never have such loving again
Now when farmers' boys on the first fair day
Come down from the hills to dring and be gay
Before the sun sinks I'll lie there in their arms
For they're good badboys from the lonely farms
But I always think as we tumble into bed
Of little Willy Wee who is dead, dead, dead.

But I always think as we tumble into bed
Of Little Willy Wee who is dead, dead, dead.
