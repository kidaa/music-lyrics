Written by Howard Houston

Oh baby I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming that you are my love
If you hear my heartbeat
Oh baby I'm feeling
I'm rocking and reeling apart
Can't you hear my heartbeat
Please take my hand - don't cry
True love - we can't deny

I feel a thunder in my heart
Every night I feel emotion
Cause you've got my love babe
Angel Heart - Oh, we'll never break apart
I feel a thunder in my heart
Every night I feel emotion
Cause you've got my love babe
Angel Heart - Oh we'll never break apart

I walk through a fire
You fill my desire for love
That's the one thing I know
Pull the strings of emotion
And see my devotion for love
Oh, there must be a way
Two hearts can beat as one
Babe I know we can go on
