There's a rule in the book that says
It's got to be fun
I hate to admit but my feelings have changed
Everybody expects to hear a love song
Love can't come from something baby that never was

And I'm leavin behind
The you in my mind
Though I know it's new
It's something I'll try
And I'll always remember
The way that we cared for 
Our time, our time

There's a time and a place where thoughts are discovered
A package of ten all the sheets that I need
What I call a gift can't be given to many
But loving a friend, baby, just ain't the same

Well I'm leavin behind
The you in my mind
Though I know it's new
It's something I'll try
And I'll always remember
The way that we cared for 
Our time, our time, our time 

Sorrow hangs like a halo, baby on my head
But regret will never fill my vacant heart, no

Well I'm leavin behind
The you in my mind
Though I know it's new
It's something I'll try
And I'll always remember
The way that we cared for 

I'm leavin behind
The you in my mind
Though I know it's new
It's something I'll try
And I'll always remember
The way that we cared for 
Our time, our time
