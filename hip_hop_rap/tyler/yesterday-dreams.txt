Written by Brian Cadd

Lonely summer, needing rain
Standing quietly going insane
Said I loved you
You never heard a word

Memories that still cause pain
I lost a feeling I can't explain
Still I need you
Don't that seem absurd

Shattered dreams in my heart
Always gonna tear me apart
Making it so hard to start all over again

Yesterday dreams
Yesterday dreams
Here they are coming again

Forming pictures in my mind
Another place, another time
It's the same old song
With just another melody

Don't ask me 'cause I don't wanna say
He's the reason that keeps me away
I want to go through it again
But you don't even see what I mean

Shattered dreams in my heart
Always gonna tear me part
Making it so hard to start all over again

Yesterday dreams
Yesterday dreams
Here they are coming again

I don't wanna lie awake at night with you and wonder why
Looking at your hurting eyes and asking me if it's all a lie

Perfect patterns of part-time love
Always aware we're gonna make it above
What I lost before
Taking us both nowhere

What you're asking I can't give
Pick up the pieces and let you live
And don't ever look back
'Cause I won't even be there

Shattered dreams in my heart
Always gonna tear me apart
Making it so hard to start all over again

Yesterday dreams
Yesterday dreams
Here they are coming again

Yesterday dreams
Yesterday dreams
Here they are coming again

Yesterday dreams
Yesterday dreams
Here they are coming again
