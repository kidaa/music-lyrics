Written by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton

There must be somethin' that we can share
Why is it all or nothin' everywhere
You got your life and I got mine
Why's our relationship hangin' on the line
I just want to know you
I just want to love you
More than words can say

Baby, take another look at your heart
And tell me you don't want me
Baby, tell me you're not comin' apart
I can hold out 'til you break
Baby, take another  look at your heart

You're breakin' up, that's no surprise
So much invested in our so-called "love lives"
Give it up, heart over mind
You can't explain away
The tears you been cryin'
I don't want to own you
I just want to know you
I just want to love you
More than words can say
