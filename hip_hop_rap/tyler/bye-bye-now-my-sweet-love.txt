There's no time now you said to be in love
Anyhow what is my life to you
Well there's no point it's true in pursuing you
And it's not that I can or I'd want to

But to be honest I'll say that there have been times
When I've desired a kiss or a smile
And once or twice you've shown the face I like
And it's affected me more than I'd want it to

But what's the use in telling you
If you don't feel the way I do
It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never have the chance to share it

Bye bye now my sweet love
Bye bye now my sweet love
Bye bye those tears I cry
I need you only to say goodbye

And now and again when I don't feel so shy
I pretend to remember your name
When the eyes don't see the heart doesn't feel
And the distance between us remains

But what's the use in telling you
If you don't feel the way I do
It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never got the chance to share it
