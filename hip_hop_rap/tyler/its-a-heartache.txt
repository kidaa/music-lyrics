It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he let's you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care, for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on, you

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

Its a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care, for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on, you

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It's a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown 

It's a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down
