So, yea, you said you heard this one
Maybe lived it twice
But with bias on my side

I swear I've got a different one
To be laid to line
And with a dime for your advice

You never saw a man
Make a fist and grab so fast he said

Good luck you know you better just forget it
Cause love is never in the same place that you left it

I said you wouldn't understand 
This was long-term love 
She was perfectly described

And what she wore when we last met
It was pink and black
A study in scarlet up inside

You never saw a man
With bigger eyes that understand 
He said

Good luck you know you better just forget it
Cause love is never in the same place that you left it

You never saw a man
With bigger eyes that understand 
He said

Good luck you know you better go and get it
Cause love is never in the same place if you left it

He said good luck you know you better go and get her
Cause love is never in the same place if you left her
