Written by Scott and Wolfe

Goodbye to the island
Hello to the rain
It's gone like a dream in the night
And it won't be back again
Goodbye to the island
Nobody's touch
Goodbye to a little bit of heaven
And I miss you so much

chorus
Oh, why love did you treat me this way
Why love did you treat me this way
Why love did you treat me this way
Why love did you treat me this way

A bed is an island
A world apart
Soft words in the middle of the night
Straight from the heart
Two heads on a pillow
So warm so close
Goodbye to the island
Where it, where it mattered the most

Chorus

Instrumental

Goodbye to the island
Hello to the rain
It's gone like a dream in the night
And it won't be back again

Chorus then fade
