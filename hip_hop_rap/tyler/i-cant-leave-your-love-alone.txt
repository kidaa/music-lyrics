There's a shadow rolling over my head
Like a cloud across the moon
There's a devil on my shoulder
Spreading his light into my room

Chorus
Broken head and empty heart
Shattered mind that's torn apart
I fall, I stumble, into the night
I can't leave your love alone
I can't leave your love alone

Wicked wind beset my window
Telling me that I'm not good
There's no life in this bleak desert
There's no life without you

Chorus

Instrumental

Chorus

I can't leave your love alone
I can't leave your love alone
I can't leave your love alone
I can't leave your love alone
I can't leave your love alone
I can't leave your love alone
