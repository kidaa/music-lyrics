Written by Iain Sutherland

Darlin', every night
I keep wondering
What I'm not doing right
Fire, burning bright
And you look so 
Oh, so good tonight

chorus
And I've been trying to make you happy for such a long time
Working hard to keep you so much it's a crime
Give me what I want cause I"m losing my mind
For your wild love
All I want is your wild love
Give me taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you

Somewhere, in your eyes
There's a love light
That you just can't disguise
Darlin', come on darlin'
every night
I still wonder
What I'm not doing right

Chorus

Wild love
All I want is your wild love
Give me taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you
Wild love
All I want is your wild love
Give me taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you
Making love to you
Making love to you

Wild love
All I want is your wild love
Give me a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to you
Wild love
Wild love
Give ma a taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to your
Wild love
All I want is your wild love
Give ma taste of your wild love
While I'm making love to your
