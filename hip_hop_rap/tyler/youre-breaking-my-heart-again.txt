Here I stand alone with my dreams 
Trying to forget all that we've been through
How can I lie and fool myself 
Knowing just how much I feel for you
This time won't be the last time
How come I just can't get away from you
It hurts so good inside

You're breaking my heart again and I can't get over you
You're breaking my heart again
I'm losing the fight
You're breaking my heart again
Breaking my heart

Without you I spend my nights 
Trying to escape my emotions
This time won't be the last time
How come I just can't get away from you
It hurts so good inside

You're breaking my heart again and I can't get over you
You're breaking my heart again
I'm losing the fight

You're breaking my heart again and I will be here for you
You're breaking my heart again
What can I do

You're breaking my heart again

You're breaking my heart again and I can't get over you
You're breaking my heart again
I'm losing the fight
