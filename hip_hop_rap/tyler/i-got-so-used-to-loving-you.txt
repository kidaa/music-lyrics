Written by Scott and Wolfe

Waking in the early morning
Thinking of you softly
From the way my heart is hurting
You might as well of shot me
Shot deep
Falling out of heaven's highway
Landing in the ocean
Drowning in a sea of heartache
Swearing a divorcion
To you

I got so used to loving you, baby
Got so used to having you round me
I got so used to loving you, baby
And baby, I can't let go
I got so used to loving you, baby
Got so used to touching you, honey
I got so used to loving you, baby
And baby, I can't let go

Waking in the early morning
Thinking of your magic
Why'd you have to disappear boy
Don't you know it's tragic
Baby it's tragic

I got so used to loving you, baby
Got so used to having you round me
I got so used to loving you, baby
And baby, I can't let go
Oh, I'm loving you, baby
Got so used to touching you, honey
I got so used to loving you, baby
And baby, I can't let go

Oh, I'm loving you, baby
I got so used to touching you, honey
Oh, I'm loving you, baby
And baby, I can't let go
I got so used to touching you, baby
I got so used to loving you, honey
I got so used to loving you, baby
And baby, I can't let go
Oh, I'm loving you, baby
