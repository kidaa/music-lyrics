Islands, from the first time we saw,
We could wait for this moment, like rocks on the shore.
We can never be closer, somehow,
For the moment that lasts, is this moment now.

When the night's on fire, will you keep the candlelight burning?
Hold on to your heart's desire. When the night's on fire
When you see one bird into the wind, another one's turning,
And the two can fly much higher.

We are islands, but never too far,
We are islands
And I need your light tonight,
And I need your light tonight.
We are islands, but never too far,
We are islands
And I need your light tonight,
And I need your light tonight.

Islands, never been to before,
And we climb so high to where the wild birds soar.
There's a new path that we found just today,
I was lost in the forest and you showed me the way.

When the night's on fire, will you keep the candlelight burning?
Hold on to your heart's desire. When the night's on fire
When you see one bird into the wind, another one's turning,
And the two can fly much higher.
