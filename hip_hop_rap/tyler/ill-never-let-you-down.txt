Written by Frankie Miller

Saw you on the mountain an angel in disguise
Then when you descended to rescue my life
You made me believe in love and as long as love's around
I won't let you down
I'll never let you down

Taught me how to show it and it's deeper than the sea
The amount of love I give to you can't come close to what you give to me
I want the world to know it till I'm buried in the ground
I won't let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
I'll never let you down

Cos when I look in your eyes I'm hypnotized
And everything I thought I'd realized goes out the window
When you're by my side I'm in paradise

What would I do if I lost you
I'd hang my head in shame
Cos I know if I lost you 
I'd be the one to blame
Don't ever let me lose you
Cos as long as loves around
I won't let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
