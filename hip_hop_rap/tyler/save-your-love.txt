Written by Jerry Lynn Williams
Duet with Frankie Miller

G: I've always wondered alone
   Afraid and on my own
   But up to now I think of you
B: Memories lost and regained
   Seem to refrain me
   On days that weren't quite so blue

chorus
A: Save your love
   Like it means the world to you
   Cause that's exactly what your love means to me
   It's like a spirit lost and finally set free
   Come on and save your love
   Save your love for me

G: You often told me your feelings
   Hiding down deep within
   Where do I begin
B: So I'll keep on singing that song
   Hope you'll sing along
   Then maybe someday we'll be friends

CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL

CHORUS

Save your love
Oh, save your love
Come on save your love
Save your love for me
Save your love
Save your love
Come on save your love
Save your love for

CHORUS

Save your love x5 and fade
