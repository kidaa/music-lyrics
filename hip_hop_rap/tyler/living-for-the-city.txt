Written by Stevie Wonder

A boy is born in Hardtime Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong, moving in the right direction

Living just enough
Just enough 
For the city

His father works, some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny

Living just enough
Just enough
For the city

His sister's black but she is sure nough pretty
Her skirt is short but lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty

Living just enough
Just enough
For the city

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives they don't use coloured people

Living just enough
Just enough 
For the city

Living just enough
Just enough
For the city

Living, just enough for the city
Living for the city
Just enough for the city

Living, just enough for the city
Living for the city
Just enough for the city
