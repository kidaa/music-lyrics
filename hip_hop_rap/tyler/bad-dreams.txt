Written by Steve Benson

She was the black sheep of her family
She was a rebel., loved living free
She gave her lovin' fast as the wind
She gave it all again and again
Sometimes mean, sometimes kind
The more she'd look, the less she'd find
She never knew what was right or wrong
Never knowing where her heart belonged yeah

chorus
Bad dreams, blue tears, and mixed emotions
Search for a heart that can't be broken
She's walking down an endless street
Her body's burning with the heat
Bad dreams, blue tears, land mixed emotions
Search for a heart that can't be broken
She's walking down an endless street
Her body's burning with the heat yeah

She loved him once but then they had a fight
The tables turn now she's cold as ice
Still searching after all these years
This lady's cried a million tears
She was a hero of the lost and found
She'd pick em up, she'd put em down
She's at the wrong place at the right time
Stone cold woman, you're way out of lone oh

repeat chorus
