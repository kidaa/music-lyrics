Written by Jerry Lynn Williams

I'm so sorry baby
I was the one who hesitated
And I know how you suffered
And I know how long you must have waited
But now both my eyes are open
And I can truly see
That I'm as sorry as I can be
Can you ever forgive me darling
Can you ever forgive me girl

I must have been crazy
My little heart must been leakin'
I admit it babe
I admit,
I was the first to weaken
But I love you oh so much
And it ain't no doubt
You know what I'm talking about
Can you ever forgive me baby
Can you ever forgive me girl

Coz I just want a little bit, little bit
Honey I don't need a lot
I just want a little bit, little bit
Of what you got

I just want a little, baby
Honey I don't need a lot
I just want a little bit, little bit
Of what you got

I'm so sorry babe
I was the one who hesitated
I know how long you suffered
And how long you must have waited

But now both my eyes are open
And I can finally see
And I'm sorry as I can be
Can you ever forgive me darling
Can you ever forgive me girl

Coz I just want a little bit, little bit
Honey I don't need a lot
I just want a little bit, little bit
Of what you got

A little bit, a little bit
Honey I don't need a lot
just a little bit
a little bit of what you got

a little bit, little bit
just a little bit, little bit
I say just a little bit
Of what you got
