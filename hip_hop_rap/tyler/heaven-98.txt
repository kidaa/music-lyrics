Here where we live
There's peace in this winter night
Pain has forever gone away
Oceans and winds are calm
And the stars so bright
Come and stay beside me
Come and be my friend

Heaven has opened it's arms above our heads
Heaven let the sun shine upon our road
Heaven let love be the guide along the way
Let the angels say hello

Far from the city lights
By an open fire
Come let's start again
Start all over again

Heaven has opened it's arms above our heads
Heaven let the sun shine upon our road
Heaven let love be the guide along the way
Let the angels say hello

Heaven has opened it's arms above our heads
Heaven let the sun shine upon our road
Heaven let love be the guide along the way
Let the angels say hello

Heaven has opened it's arms above our heads
Heaven let the sun shine upon our road
Heaven let love be the guide along the way
Let the angels say hello

Let the angels say hello
