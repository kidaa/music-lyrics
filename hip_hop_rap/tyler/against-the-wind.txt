Living in a danger zone
A lonely man a lonely child
So many miles away from home
Emotions running wild with me

Come take my heart, come feel the
Burns of fire
Come and break my heart and feel my
Loving mind

Oh against the wind  I'm flying
Against the wind  I'm crying
This night was made for a lonely
Don't break my heart tonight, no

Oh against the wind I'm flying
Against the wind I'm crying
This night was made for a lonely
Don't break my heart tonight, no

Oh you need a helping hand
The times are getting tough
Baby come and try again
There's no living without love, in my heart
It's hard for me, but it's harder to
ignore it
Oh my fantasy, come feel my love tonight

Oh against the wind I'm flying
Against the wind I'm crying
This night was made for a lonely
Don't break my heart tonight, no
