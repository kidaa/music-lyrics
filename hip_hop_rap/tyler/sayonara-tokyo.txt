Written by: Crutchfield, Nakahata, Nakamura

Sometimes you were tender, so tender to me
But I was looking for freedom, just had to be free
Like a baby with a new toy, I was too young to know
Living in a dream world, where real love can't grow

chorus

It's Sayonara Tokyo
It's goodbye forever
I'll never be back, never be back
Sayonara Tokyo
We cannot live in a memory
I'm looking for love, where it finds me
Sayonara Tokyo
Time is a train on a one way track
I'm going away to the cold north

Now it seems such a long time, when the miles come between
So many nameless faces, and the places I've seen
Bringing yesterday's memories oh so clear to my mind
I can finally see where my heart was blind

repeat chorus
