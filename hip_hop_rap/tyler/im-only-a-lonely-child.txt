Written by Dieter Bohlen

That's no way to say goodbye
Oh, these tears will never dry
This world is like a burning fire
Baby can't we still be friends
Till it ends there is no end
Baby can't you see my deep desire
Always forever - babe I'll keep trying
Always forever - to stop it dying

chorus
I'm only a lonely child
Inside a lonely woman
Come take my heart tonight
Make the clouds disappear
I'm only a lonely child
Inside a lonely woman
My heart is burning wild
I'm fighting my fears

Nothing going on our way
Darling can't you hear me say
Only a strong love will stay forever
Rain is such a lonesome sound
In the city of the lost and found
We better try hard to get together
Always forever- babe I'll keep trying
always forever - to stop it dying

Chorus and fade
