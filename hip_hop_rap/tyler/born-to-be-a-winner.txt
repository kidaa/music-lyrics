Written by Steve Benson

You never give up when the others they do
You never fail you never feel blue
Everyone loves you
Baby I tell you the truth
Life is the hardest game
The pain not for you
You make it and take it
You never look back
Walk through a fire
You never lose track
Everybody loves you
Oh it's your time
Everybody needs you
Baby be mine

chorus
You're born to be a winner
You're born to be a winner
Born to be a winner, my love
Oh there's no mountain high enough
Don't hesitate
You're born to be a winner
Born to be a winner
You'll never give up
Oh you break my heart
Baby, baby we can make a new start

You take every chance
You're so young and so strong
You give what they want
You'll never grow old
Heaven must have sent you
Baby you make me feel good
I'd spend the rest of my life with you
If only I could 
You light up my life
Wrap my troubles in dreams
Take my desires
You know what they need
Everybody loves you
There's no other say
Everybody needs you
I beg you to stay

Chorus and fade
