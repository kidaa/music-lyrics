Jim Steinman/Andrew Lloyd Webber

I want a fine perfume, a powdered blue Corvette.
If there's a slower death than living here and now, they haven't found it yet.
I need a man who knows, what I am really like.
And I don't give a damn about a life after death,
But I've gotta get some proof that there's a life after birth.

Tyre tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind.
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find.
Tyre tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past.
So many ways to stay hungry baby, so many ways to go fast.

I need a push up bra, I need some satin sheets.
Give me some real rich food, I want some succulant sweets.
I want you by my side, you'll be all my own.
And I know what I want, at the time that I know,
That I don't wanna spend another minute alone.

Tyre tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind.
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find.
Tyre tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past.
So many ways to stay hungry baby, so many ways to go fast.

Those good girls never know what they're missing,
But us bad girls almost always do,
And what we're missing most are the real good times,
I want them bad and I want 'em now!
I was born going faster than the limits allow,
I want it bad and I want it now.
We were born going faster than the limits allow,
Faster than the limits allow.
Right here!  Right now!

I wanna show you what I want you to do, where and when and how.
I want it bad and I want it now, we were born going faster than the limits
allow.

I wanna show you what I want you to do, where and when and how.
I want it bad and I want it now, we were born going faster than the limits
allow.

Tyre tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind.
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find.
Tyre tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past.
So many ways to stay hungry baby, so many ways to go fast.
Oh! Yeaaah!!!
