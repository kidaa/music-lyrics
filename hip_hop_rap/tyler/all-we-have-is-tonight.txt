Written by Steve Benson

There's a chance that we can make it 
There's a chance to make it right
Words cannot express my love on this endless night
Just one step from heaven
One step from paradise
Memories are made of this
Don't tell me no lies
Give me one good reason
If you don't want my love
Everybody needs some love
And I think I got enough

chorus
All we have is tonight
Don't throw away this miracle
We are stronger than pride
You gotta let me feel the ground
You only won - playing the game
Losers gonna fall
Try if you want to
Try if you dare
Winners take it all

Baby, can't you hear my heartbeat
I'm looking through the eyes of love
Heaven just can't wait a while
One night's not enough
We can be so good together
We can make it on our own
There must be a way my love
Don't ride this way alone
Lost between two fires
The night beats the day
Hiding for my hungry heart
Love's here to stay  

Chorus
