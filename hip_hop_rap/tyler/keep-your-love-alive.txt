When it's getting good
Then you better be safe
Cause a mind like yours is too good to waste
Keep your love alive - keep your love alive

A body like yours
It would be a crime
If you push it to the edge of the borderline
Keep your love alive - keep your love alive

Gotta be careful when you're takin a chance
You gotta take care - it's a new romance
Keep your love alive - love alive

It really never was about a one night stand
It's a love for life so you better think twice
Keep your love alive - love alive

Love for life
Love for life
Love for life
you'll be alive tomorrow if you're safe today
what better way to show you care for me

Can't ignore the facts when they're in your face
It's time you took some responsibility
Keep your love alive - keep your love alive

Cause you know the love we have is always gonna be
You know I want you and you want me
Keep your love alive - love alive

Love for life 
Love for life
Love for life
You'll be alive tomorrow if you're safe today
What better way to show you care for me

When the love is right
You gotta say I want you here inside my life
Living for the light that's coming from within
I want to take good care of you - I love you
