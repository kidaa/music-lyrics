Written by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock

Sung with Dan Hartman

I remember times like this
Memories you can't dismiss of paradise
Holding you inside my heart
Looking for a way to start our love again
Every night and every day
We can find a better way to live all our lives
We can be as one again
Finally find a way to say that we know the truth

'Til the end of time we love
Reaching for the higher ground
'Til the end of time we live
Giving all we have to give

Children of another time
We lay it all upon the line
To say I love you
Every night and every day
We can find a better way to say
I love you

'Til the end of time we love
Reaching for the higher ground
'Til the end of time we live
Giving all we got to give
Giving all we had to give
Giving all we had to give
'Til the end of time we love
Every night and every day
Reaching for the higher ground
Reaching for the higher ground

'Til the end of time we live
Giving all we got to give
