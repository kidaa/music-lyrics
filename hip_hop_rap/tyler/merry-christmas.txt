Merry Merry Christmas
Don't change kids stay with us
Stay little Jesus
Hold onto my hand
It's not a long way
To fly alone
Don't fly in vain
It's so hard anyway
To become a man

Happy birthday Christmas
Welcome home Jesus
Although you reign on us
You can't understand
Why even a child
Learning the truth
Always learns pain
Why does he have to cry
To become a man

Help me Santa Claus
Come close to my heart
All my doors are closed
I can't blame my heart
I can't play my part

Wanted mister x-mas
Dream on little Jesus
Kids don't grow up like us
We could change the plan
Here comes the darkness
Time to be sad
Here comes the rain
Please don't leave them hopeless
To become a man
To become a man
To become a man
