I have been thinking, which I shouldn't do
Cause it gets me in trouble and farther from you

I don't want a sentimental
Short and sweet and confidential Goodbye

My thoughts belong in a book in a store
Where they're silently read, but spoken no more

I didn't give my all and to be honest with you
I didn't even try

Well I want you back so bad
I'm gonna change the way I'm acting
I'm gonna change and I'm so glad

I'm gonna write you a letter
So much for the better
And if it goes my way
I'll have you running back to me

I'm a natural born forgetter
So much for the better
I can be romantic
I just got to try to be

I have been thinking, again this is bad
It seems that my thinking can drive you quite mad

But you can't say there's another word though
To call this feeling in my heart

I admit I take advice from more romantic minds
But I can proudly reassure you this idea was all mine 

I'm gonna write you a letter
So much for the better
And if it goes my way
I'll have you running back to me

I'm a natural born forgetter
So much for the better
I can be romantic
I just got to try to be

I admit I take advice from more romantic minds
But I can proudly reassure you this idea was all mine 

I'm gonna write you a letter
So much for the better
And if it goes my way
I'll have you running back to me

I'm a natural born forgetter
So much for the better
I can be romantic
I just got to try to be

I can be romantic, I just got to try to be
I can be romantic, I just got to try to be
