Every time you see me walking in the room
Can you see it in my face
I've lost interest in all the things you do
And I'm feeling misplaced

Can you tell me it's over
I don't wanna lie
All I really wanna know is
The reason why

Where did our love go wrong
Cause I need to know
Can you tell me can you tell me baby
Where did our love go wrong
Cause I need to know
Can you tell me can you tell me baby

I'm sure that you feel the same way too
But you're hiding it inside
There's nothing left for us between me and you
Nothing but heartache inside

Can you tell me it's over
I don't wanna lie
All I really wanna know is
The reason why

Where did our love go wrong
Cause I need to know
Can you tell me can you tell me baby
Where did our love go wrong
Cause I need to know

Our love is strong come on
We could make it through
There's nothing left to lose
It will be alright - alright

Where did our love go wrong
Cause I need to know
Can you tell me can you tell me baby
Where did our love go wrong
Cause I need to know
Cause I need to know
I need to know
Where did our love go wrong
Where did our love go wrong
Where did our love go wrong
Where did our love go wrong
It will be alright
It will be alright
