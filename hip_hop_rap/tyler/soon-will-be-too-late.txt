Morning has broken with silence in my room
Eyes have been opened with pain beneath the moon
Feelings that are colder than ice upon a rock
Endless nights in anger and hours filled with talk

Beauty of a lifetime a crystal-clear romance
Were supposed to be mine and join me in a dance
Days were filled with pleasure no clouds were in my sight
Love was our treasure that no one could deny...

But where do we go from here?
Soon will be too late to
Go anywhere from here
Soon will be too late

Hopefully dreaming that love will still survive
Deeply within me a song that never dies
All those days of passion and all those lonely nights
Must have been worth something they lightened up my life

Come and lay beside me let gentle love be real
Look into my eyes for this is how I feel
Let me wipe your tears away you don't need to be sad
Share with me your dreams that once were all we had

But where do we go from here?
Soon will be too late to 
Go anywhere from here
Soon will be too late

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
