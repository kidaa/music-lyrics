Written by Scott and Wolfe

I need you at the midnight hour
I need you when the lights go down
I can't get over the fact that I need you come back
Cause it's driving me crazy

I need you in the morning rain
I need you and it's getting late
I can't get enough of your love, cause enough of your love
Oh, I can't do without it

Come on, come on and give me loving
Come on to me
Come on, come on, and give your love to me
Come on, come on, and give me loving
Come on to me
Come on, come on, and give your love to me

I need you and I can't let go
I need to feel the loving flow
I can't get over the truth, no I don't want to loose
All the feeling you gave me

I need you at the midnight hour
I need you when the lights go down
I can't get over the fact that I need you come back
Cause it's driving me crazy

Come on, come on, and give me loving
Come on to me
Come on, come on, and give your love to me

INSTRUMENTAL

I need you and I can't let go
I need to feel the loving flow
I can't get over the truth, no I don't want to loose
All the feeling you gave me

Come on, come on, and give me loving
Come on to me
Come on, come on, and give your love to me
Come on, come on, and give me loving
Come on to me
Come on, come on, and give your love to me
