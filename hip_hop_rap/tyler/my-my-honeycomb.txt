Bonnie's First SIngle

Here I Am In the City
With A Picture Of You In My Head
I Remember That Night
The Words You Said

You Told Me I Was So Pretty
With the Moon Shining Down On My Head
I'm Hung Up On You Now
But You're Not There

chorus
My My Honeycomb
The Bees Are Buzzing
The Birds Have Flown
Wild Wild Honeycomb
Leave My Honey Alone

My My Honeycomb
The Bees Are Buzzing
I Should Have Known
Sweet Sweet Honeycomb
Leave My Honey Alone

I Wrote You So Many Letters
I Was Hoping You'd Answer Replies
Then I Sat By Myself
To Watch the Hours

But You Didn't Come By
Not A Word Not A Call Not A Thing
Don't You Know How It Hurts Me
When You Sting
