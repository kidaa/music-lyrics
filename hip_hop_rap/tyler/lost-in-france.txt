Written by Scott and Wolfe

I was lost in France
In the fields the birds were singing
I was lost in France
And the day was just beginning
As I stood there in the morning rain
I had a feeling I can't explain
I was lost in France in love

I was lost in France
In the street a band was playing
And the crowd all danced
Didn't catch what they were saying
When I looked up he was standing there
I knew I shouldn't but I didn't care
I was lost in France in love

chorus
Oo la la la Oo la la la dance
Oo la la la dancing
Oo la la la Oo la la la dance
Oo la la la dancing
Oo la la la Oo la la la dance
Oo la la la dancing

I was lost in France
And the vines were over flowing
I was lost in France
And a million stars were glowing
And I looked round for a telephone
To say baby I won't be home
I was lost in France in love

Repeat chorus

And I looked round for a telephone
To say baby I won't be home
I was lost in France in love

Repeat chorus till fade
