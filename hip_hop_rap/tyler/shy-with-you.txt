More than often when I'm with you
I become a nervous kid
I imagine your old girlfriends
I imagine what you did
I don't know if this is normal
I don't know if this is love
With you I get so formal
And I feel all this other stuff

Shy with you
Though I've been around the block
Shy with you
Cause you're the one I really want

Other guys I don't care about
So easy with them
Anything you can do without
So easy to win
I can't do without wyour love
So I try to be cool
Everytime you call my bluff
I just stand there like a fool

Shy with you
Though I've been around the block
Shy with you
Cause you're the one I really want
Shy with you
Sometimes a heart can hurt a lot
Shy with you
Cause you're the one I really want  

I need your love
I need your love to see me through
I want you
I want you and so it's true
Shy with you...shy with you...shy with you
