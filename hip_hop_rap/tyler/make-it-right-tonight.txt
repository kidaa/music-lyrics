Written by Andy Hill

It's gonna take time for us to trust again
I can see it in your eyes
All these walls you've built around yourself
To keep the hurt away
Keep the tenderness inside

We've gotta find doors
Gotta find an open road to your heart
Come on baby...

You gotta be strong
Life is what you make it
I'm hanging on
Love's right here, just take it
Whatever is wrong
It won't take long to make it right
We can make it right tonight

We've got to find words to heal these differences
Gotta find some peace of mind
There'll come a day you'll realise that,
After all, we're only human
no one's perfect all the time

But you got to hold on tight as hell to your dream
It's never too late baby

But you gotta be strong
Life is what you make it
I'm hanging on
Love's right here, just take it
Whatever is wrong
It' won't take long to make it right
We can make it right tonight

Twenty Twenty vision
Looking back at out mistakes
But when it comes to now you can't see straight

Make this decision
Heaven's here for us to take
And heaven won't wait
