If you're wondering why the feeling's changed between us
If I seem a little shaky when we kiss
Oh-hoh oh it ain't what it seems
You did nothing to spoil my dreams
No I'm the one who's let it all go wrong

Blame me for I was hopelessly in love
Just for a night I fell in love
And I couldn't stop

Blame me I was so lost inside his arms
Was so blind inside his arm
I couldn't see
baby I'm sorry

If you're wondering why I turned from you this morning
And I couldn't look directly in your eyes
Oh-hoh oh it ain't what it seems
You did nothing to spoil my dreams
No I'm the one who's let it all go wrong

Blame me for I was hopelessly in love
Just for a night I fell in love
And I couldn't stop

Blame me, I was a stranger to myself
If it was only someone else instead of me
Baby I'm sorry

Blame me for I was hopelessly in love
Just for a night I fell in love
And I couldn't stop

Blame me, I was a stranger to myself
If it was only someone else instead of me

Oh-hoh oh

Blame me I was so lost inside his arms
Was so blind inside his arms
I couldn't see

Oh-hoh
