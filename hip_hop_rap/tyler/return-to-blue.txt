I saw your eyes 
I felt your passion
And still I can't decide what to do
I heard your lies
I felt your hunger
I'll have to realize what is true

I'm not the one looking out for perfection
I believe in love and I believe in you
But it's so hard for me to understand

To keep on loving you the way you want me to
I return to blue
I don't know what to do
To keep on loving you I need to know the truth
I return to blue
I just don't want want to lose
So I make the move
Return to blue

It might be hard
Sure won't be easy
But it's the way it has to be
Too many nights without you near me
Without the love I need to feel

I'm not the one looking out for perfection
I believe in love and I believe in you
But it's so hard for me to understand

To keep on loving you the way you want me to
I return to blue
I don't know what to do 
To keep on loving you I need to know the truth
I return to blue
I just don't want want to lose
So I make the move
Return to blue
