Written by Howard Houston

Hearts beating like a drum
Like foxes on the run
Nothing baby, nothing is forever
It's too late to stop me now
You couldn't anyhow
Baby can't you see us together

Oh oh tell me baby
Oh oh tell me now - tell me now
Tell me now - baby now
Are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
I'll sail with you the seven seas 
Cause I know babe what you feel
Are you too hat
Can't you see it's forever
I say it' like a symphony
Baby you know the way I feel 
Oh be my eternity
Baby come on back home - baby tonight

Reaching out to take your hand
Together we will stand
Not just in my arms and in my heart
You know I love you so much
I live my life for your touch
Was it just a favourite from the start

Oh oh tell me baby
Oh oh tell me now - tell me now
Tell me now - baby now
Are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
I'll sail with you the seven seas
Cause I know babe what you feel
are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
I say it's like a symphony
Baby you know the way I feel
Oh be my eternity
Baby come on back to me - baby tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
I'll sail with you the seven seas
Cause I know babe what you feel
Are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
I say it's like a symphony
Baby know the way I feel

Why are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
I say it's like a symphony
Baby know the way I feel

Why are you too hot
Can't you see it's forever
