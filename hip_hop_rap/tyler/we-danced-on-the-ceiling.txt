Written by Scott and Wolfe

We danced on the ceiling
We danced on the wall
It gave me the feeling
That I wasn't there at all
We danced on the moonlight
We danced on the stars
Too early a day late
Came after the miles

chorus
Ooh, I don't want to let it end
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to let the only thing we ever had expire
Won't you take me through the night
To that far and distant light
Won't you take me back to paradise again

You took me to heaven
You took me from hell
We danced on the ceiling
Together we fell

Instrumental

Chorus

We danced on the ceiling
we danced on the wall
It gave me the feeling
That I wasn't there at all
You took me from heaven
Oh, you took me from hell
We danced on the ceiling
Together we fell

Chorus

Cause we danced on the ceiling
And we danced on the wall
It gave me the feeling
