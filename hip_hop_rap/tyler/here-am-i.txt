Here am I in love again
Clinging to your arms again
Wondering why I wanted to be free
Here am I next to you
Wondering what we oughta do
Can't afford to lose it all again
Here am I, there are you
We nearly broke our hearts in two
Wold have been the worst thing in the world

When I thought that we could live apart
I must'a been crazy
What a fool I was, what a fool
From the moment you got in my heart
I should've known baby
But now I know

Here am I in love again
Clinging to your arms again
Wondering why I wanted to be free
When I thought that we could live apart
I must'a been crazy
What a fool I was, what a fool
From the moment you got in my heart
I should've known baby
But now I know

Her am I in love again
Clinging to your arms again
Wondering why I wanted to be free
Here am I next to you
Wondering what we oughta do
Can't afford to lose it all again

Here am I .......yeh yeah
I'm clinging to your arms again
Here am I, there are you
We nearly broke our hearts in two
It would have been the worst thing in the world
