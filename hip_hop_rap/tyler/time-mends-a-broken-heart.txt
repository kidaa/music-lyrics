Written by Jeff Lynne and Kiki Dee

I'm living in another time another place
I knew you then
It used to be a different World
And now I start to live again
A sight of heaven in a grain of sand
Leading me on taking me by the hand

Time mends a broken heart
Time mends a broken heart
Love tears it all apart
But time mends a broken heart

I see you in another life
There's someone else that I didn't know
It used to hurt me deep inside
I had to learn to let you go
I thought that happiness was by your side
I didn't know that it was here in me
And still alive

Time mends a broken heart
Time mends a broken heart
Love tears it all apart
But time mends a broken heart

Time mends a broken heart
Time mends a broken heart
Love tears it all apart
But time mends a broken heart
