Written by Dieter Bohlen

Paradise is you my love
With you by my side
Now until forever
Till the end of time
I've wished upon a thousand stars
Someday you I'd find
I'm living for you baby
You'll always be mine
I'm searching for you baby
Drowning in your love
No I'lI never give it up

Oh I'll climb every mountain
And I'll cross every sea
To lay in your arms
For eternity
Sail every ocean to capture your heart
To be in your arms
Never to be apart
I'll climb every mountain
To be with you
I'll cross every sea
To be with you
I'm here for you darling
You belong, to me

Since you won my heart my love
I've never been the same
I need your love to feed it
Like the flower needs the rain
Somethings they will never change 
Babe you know it's true
I live for you
And it's all that I can do
Waiting for you baby
Hungry for your love
No, I'll never get enough

Oh, I'll climb every mountain
And I'll cross every sea
To lay in your arms
For eternity
Sail every ocean
To capture your heart
To be in your arms 
Never to be apart
I'll climb every mountain
To be with you
I'll cross every sea
To be with you
I'm here for you darling
You belong, to me

I'll climb every mountain
To be with you
I'll cross every sea
To be with you
I'm here for you darling
You belong, to me
