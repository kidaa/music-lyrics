Memories of happiness
Are all I have when you're not here
Oh I wish I could hold you in my arms again
Rain is such a lonely sound
Falling softly to the ground
Oh I wish I could hold you in my arms again
I need to hold you near so until then

Send me the pillow that you dream on
Send me a love line to your heart
Oh babe I know that you're the only one
Darling if I must stay here without you
Oh send me the pillow that you dream on
Send me your love straight from the heart
Always forever baby I love you
Darling if I must stay here without you

Lonely nights I dream of you
Of all the things that we would do
Oh I know I will hold you in my arms again
Think of how it used to be
Lying here next to me
Oh I know I will hold you in my arms again
I long for you, but darling until then

Oh send me the pillow that you dream on
Send me a love line to your heart
Oh babe I know that you're the only one
Darling if I must stay here without you
Please darling, send me the pillow that you dream on
Send me your love straight from the heart
Always forever baby I love you
Darling if I must stay here without you
