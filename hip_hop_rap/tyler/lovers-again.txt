Written by Desmond Child

I got pictures of you in funny poses
Letters from you with fresh yellow roses
I've got souvenirs of fun times together
And I'll cherish those years but I'll bet I'll forever

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that I'm 
The one in the end, I was you friend
Lovers again

I got pictures of you with stolen kissed
We looked so young and so full of promise
And we had those dreams
But they're not forgotten
Cause I'll build that house with the yellow rose garden

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that I'm
The one in the end, I was you friend
Lovers again

INSTRUMENTAL

There's a picture of you in yesterday's paper
With that smile I knew and the new name you've taken
And I'll live each day without being bitter
Cause we worked that way
And I know It's not over

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that I'm
The one waiting there and in the end
We'll be lovers again
