Written by Harold Faltermeyer / Gernot Rothenbach

He's seen all the changes
Been going up and down
Had to rearrange It
But never lost his crown
Never was afraid of playing his last round
He is he is the king

Look into his face
It never told you lies
Falling down from grace
It's been more than twice
But there's always one thing that you should realize
He is he is the king

He is the king
No one else will be around
He is the king
Sometimes lost but now he's found
Without losing all
You won't touch sacred ground
He is he is the king
He is the king

Loving her was easy
They were day and night
Trying to release her
Was a never ending fight
He had only one chance
Playing for her life
He is he is the king

But there's always one thing you should realize
He is he is the king

He is the king
No one else will be around
He is the king
Sometimes lost but now he's found
Without losing all
You won't touch sacred ground
He is he is the king
He is the king

He is the king
No one else will be around
He is the king
Sometimes lost but now he's found
Without losing all
You won't touch sacred ground
He is he is the king
He is the king
