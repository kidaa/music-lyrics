From the "Der Konig Von St. Pauli" Soundtrack

Written by Harold Faltermeyer

spoken
Now You're Out There All By Yourself
But Still The Whole World Can See You

sung
The World Is a Small Place Somebody Told You
But That Is Just One Way Things Can Be
Because Under the Surface Of Friendly Horizons
There's More Truth Than You Like To Believe

You're Looking For Heroes To Cover Your Wildness
You're Looking For Cages To Be Kept
But No One Is Stronger Than the Devils Inside
So Here's the Point to Decide

All These Illusions Won't Cover Your Pride
You're Looking For Reasons Your Feelings Won't Hide
The World May Go Down But Devil Is Right
But For Me You're the Queen of the Night

You Are A Women
You're the One Who's Loving
You Are A Women
You Decide Who's Coming
There's Always A Way
With the Games That You Play
You Don't Need Nobody
To Tell You You Are What You Are

spoken
Now Is This What You Wanted
Are You Happy
I Still Think You Don't Know What You Want

But If This Is Your Way
You'll Have To Go With It
All the Way
Til the End
