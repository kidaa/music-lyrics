Written by Hill and Mann

You ask me if I love you
I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do
When I'm only just beginning
To see the real you

chorus
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
Then I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance with all it's strategies
Leaves me battling with my pride
And through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitate prize fighter
Still trapped within his youth

Chorus

Instrumental

Oh, times I want to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I want to break through
And hold you endlessly

Chorus
