You said I'd slide into myself
You said I'd slide destroy myself
Cause when I wake inside myself
I knew I'd take away from you

So see if I could find my life
In the shadows that you hide
Find our lives
In the wires that decide
Beside I'd say I slide

Into dream, my mistake
In what's real
In what I take
With the words that made me stay
I knew they'd take away from you

So see if I could find my life
In the shadows that you hide
Find our lives
In the wires that decide
Beside I'd say I slide

Into you, into sleep
In what's real in what I'll keep
Close your eyes and let me see
What you'll take away from me 

So see if I could find my life
In the shadows that you hide
Find our lives
In the wires that we hide
Inside I'd say I slide
