Written by Paul Mills

My friend you're worn out and aching now
Your life stretched tight and breaking now
And you seem to find that every morning's 
Like a mountain you must climb

Forget her, shake her free
Like a leaf from a tree, you must let her go
It's hard I know
But tomorrow is another road that leads
Away from here, to the first horizon
Forget her

My friend you could open windows now
Let the cool breezes through your life somehow
'Cos there's people out there, other people
crying dying trying to get somewhere

Forget her, let her go
with the ebb and flow of the passing tide
Now she's fortune's bride
And the days line up like cards and you can deal 
Yourself a chance while the wheel's still turning
Forget her

 Well I'm so good at giving advice
But I know when you look at my life
It seems crazy
But I can stand aside
And I can see with different eyes
Sometimes more clearly

Forget her, till she sees

Like a face in a dream so far away
She will fade away
And tomorrow is another road that leads
Away from here, to the first horizon
Forget her - she has forgotten you
Forget her
