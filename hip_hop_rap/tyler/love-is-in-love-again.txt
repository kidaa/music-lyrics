Written by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock

Ooh run away lucky while you still know the way
If you're lookin for your chance for one good payday
Do you really think you've go a ghost of a chance?
Its the coldest of towns to be lookin for romance

Ooh run away baby - you're too young to see
The way it's goin' down on the city streets
When trouble comes around there is no mystery
You're runnin' from it all so you better run now

Love is in pieces - put it back together now
It's supposed to be easy - but it's so so mad
All the things we say
When the world's gone crazy - it's so hard to handle
Sooner or later it'll all come clearer 
When love is in love again

Ooh pictures in the paper of the faces you've seen
Walking down the halls where justice is done
What they say they say - is not what they mean?
A different set of rules than are meant for you and me

Love is in pieces - put it back together now
It's supposed to be easy but it's so so mad
All the things we say
When the world's gone crazy - love's so hard to handle
Sooner or later it'll all come clearer
When love is in love again

Everybody's looking for an easier way 
So go go go go 
Everybody running from a shadow today
But they run so slow
