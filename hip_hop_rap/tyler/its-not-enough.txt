When I wakeup in the morning
And I turn around and you're not there
Oh, it hurts to know you're still so far away
Though I know deep inside you still care
And I want you, ooh really want you
Oh, anyway and anyhow
I've waited such a long time for your sweet love
But I need you back home with me now cause

Chorus
It's not enough to say that you love me
And it's not enough to say that you care
And it's not enough to say that you need me
If I wake up and still you're not there
And it's not enough to say that you love me
It's not enough to say that you care
And it' s not enough when you say that you need me
If I wake up and still you're not there
Oh do you care?

Instrumental

And in the evening it's not easy
When you're so many miles from home
Oh, I need you here to hold and comfort me
I'm so tired of being alone

Cause it's not enough to say that you love me
And it's not enough to say that you care
And it's not enough when you say that you need me
If I wake up and still you're not there

You gotta try to understand
That a woman like me just needs a man
To love, oh yes she does
I know you love me loud and clear
But if you're not here
It's not enough - you know

Chorus

If I wake up and still you're not there
Oh no no no, it's not enough
No no no, it's not enough
