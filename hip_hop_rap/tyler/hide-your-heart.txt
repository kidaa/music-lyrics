Johnny saw her ridin' on a streetcar named "Desire"
His fate was sealed
She could see him comin' like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was ding of the streets
She was his possesion like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better run, better run

Better hide your heart
Better hold on tight
Better say your prayers
Cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart
Cause you're playin' with fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Hey, hey, hey, hey, do, do, do, do,

The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye
And said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run

Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him comin'
Till he gad them both in sight
You could feel the chill
A shot rang out like thunder
And the blood was on her hands
With nothing won
When someone lies there dyin'
Lovers finally understand
