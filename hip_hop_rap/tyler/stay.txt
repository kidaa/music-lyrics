Please be mine
I know

Oh I know you've been fooling with my heart
Cause deep inside you don't know where to start
So insecure of what tomorrow will bring
Oh please be sure you're my all and everything
You've heard it all before
I'm asking you once more

To baby stay, stay for a lifetime
Don't go away
Oh, baby be mine
Cause I know
I'll always be loving you
Oh baby stay
We'll make forever
For we were born 
To be together
Cause we are strong
I'll always believe in you

Oh I know, strange things happen everyday
This love will grow, you're the light to guide my way
Don't be afraid, I'll never let you down
Please won't you stay, have faith in this love that we found
Don't throw this love away
Oh baby won't you stay

Oh baby stay 
We'll make forever 
For we were born 
To be together 
Cause we are strong
I'll always believe in you
Oh baby stay, stay for a lifetime
Don't go away
Oh baby be mine
Cause I know
I'll always be loving you
Oh baby stay, stay for a lifetime
Don't go away
Oh baby be mine
Cause I know
I'll always be loving you
