You gotta breakout

You're out in the world out there
Impossible dreams can take you where
Ooh, You can win it all
Sneak out, it's the way you feel
Reaching up to make it real
Ooh, Together we can win it all
No more running in a golden cage
There's only one way you're gonna go from pain

Chorus
Ooh you gotta breakout now
You gotta breakout now
You gotta breakout - you're taking on the world
Ooh you gotta breakout now
You gotta breakout
The fools still shake out
You're taking on the world
Ooh you gotta breakout now
You gotta breakout now
You gotta breakout
You're taking on the world
Ooh you gotta breakout
The fools still shake out
Gotta breakout
You're taking on the world
Taking on the world tonight

Like a cat on a hot tin roof
It don't take long to see the truth
You can do anything you want to
Push it to the limit don't ever stop
There's only one way you're gonna get on top

Chorus

Instrumental

Taking on the world
Breakout now
Breakout now
You're taking on the world
Breakout now breakout now
Breakout now breakout now
You're taking on the world

No more living under the gun
There's only one way you're gonna get on top

Chorus and fade
