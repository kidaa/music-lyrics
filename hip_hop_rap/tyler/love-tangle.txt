Written by Scott and Wolfe

It's a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby, and Anne
We don't understand

Billy he loves me
But I, I just don't love him
Cause I only love Bobby
But a Bobby loves Anne
Anne she loves Billy
But a his eyes are on me
But I only see Bobby
But a Bobby loves Anne

chorus
We've got ourselves a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby, and Anne
Looks like a love tangle
Something we don't understand
More than a triangle
Billy, me, Bobby, and Anne
We don't understand

Instrumental

Like a love story
When you find a page missing
It's a four - way heartbreaker
Cause a Bobby loves Anne

Chorus
