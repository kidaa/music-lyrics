There were times when I was young and free
And I said I need nobody
Only you and eternity
But tonight I'm feeling so alone
And I know I need somebody
But your heart is made of stone
And I know I need somebody
But your heart is made of stone

chorus
Tonight, don't let forever fade
Tonight my dreams can come true
Cause theres no mountain high enough
If God gave love to you
If God gave love to you

All my dreams are just a memory
Of a river full of love babe, to my endless destiny
Always said we'd make my dreams come true
And I have never been so lonely
I have never been so blue
Oh I need, I need your loving
And you know you need me too

repeat chorus twice
