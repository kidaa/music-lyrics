Written by Nik Kershaw

No matter how hard I try
No matter how many days go by
I really can't make this feeling go away
Whenever I change I mind
Whenever I turn my head around
The only one I can see every single day

He's got a hold on me
Nothing I can say
Nothing I can do
He's got a hold on me
And pretty soon he may
Have a hold on you

Whenever he's somewhere else
I try to remember if I can
When if only I could forget I think I'd be just fine
I wonder where he cam from
I wonder what name he answers to
Whatever he calls himself I'd like to call him mine

He's got a hold on me
Nothing I can say
Nothing I can do
He's got a hold on me
And pretty soon he may
Have a hold on you

It could be my low resistance
And you can all be as smug as hell
But you all better keep your distance
Unless you wanna get burnt as well

Whenever he walks on by
And looks at me then I know
That he is never letting go

He's got a hold on me
Nothing I can say
Nothing I can do
He's got a hold on me
And pretty soon he may
Have a hold on you
