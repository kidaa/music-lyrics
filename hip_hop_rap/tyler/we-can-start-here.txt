Drifting stars above the high trees
Recognize see it's own destiny
And all the reasons to believe
Our future from tonight is through
I'm talking to you

I know you feel the same way
We know the game we could play
You know there's no turning back
We can start here

Ocean sound below the high seas
Understand listen to how we feel
It's the circle of our dreams
Touch me now or set me free
I'm talking to you

I know you feel the same way
We know the game we could play
You know there's no turning back
We can start here

The fire in our hearts
We have found this perfect glow
I'm talking to you

I know you feel the same way
We know the game we could play
You know there's no turning back
We can start here

I know you feel the same way
We know the game we could play
You know there's no turning back
We can start here

I know you feel the same way
We know the game we could play
You know there's no turning back
We can start here
