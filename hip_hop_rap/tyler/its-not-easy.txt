I don't question the light that shines from your window
I don't want to hear what the people might say
They think it's only looks that's hidden in your shadow
But I'm no different and that's ok
They've been abused and their so confused, it's not wonder
They'll take what they can and run
They spend their lives in the doorway
The doorway of a lifetime
And their aching arms give no reprieve
Cause they don't understand

Chorus
It's not easy
Never has or ever will be
Take this loving from me
And you will break my heart
It's not easy
Never has or ever will be
Take this loving from me
And you will break my heart

Maybe the day will come when the streets ain't full of everyone
Just trying to hang on to what they can
And you might find when you wake up, the break of dawn has come
And all the sisters of sin are awaiting you
They're waiting to wrap their empty selves around your warm, warm and
     loving heart
And clutch at your breast with a hand of ice
So pray the winds of change, don't let them bring you down
To that no good, not good, cheap talking crowd
Cause they don't understand
