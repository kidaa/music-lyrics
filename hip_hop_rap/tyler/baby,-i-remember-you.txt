Sometimes late in the night I wonder how it is
Two people so much in love should end up like this
May hear you somewhere so many worlds apart
When you think how close we were it's enough to break your heart

Baby, baby, baby, remember the love you gave me
Baby, baby I remember you
Baby, baby, baby, remember the love you gave me
Cause baby, baby I sure remember you

Sometimes late in the night holding someone new
Sometimes I have closed my eyes, thought that it was you
Dreams, dreams of what might have been is living in the past
I'm just goad I knew you once, though it couldn't last

Baby, baby, baby, remember the love you gave me
Cause baby, baby I sure remember you
Baby, baby, baby, remember the love you gave me
Cause baby, baby I sure remember you

Baby, baby, baby, remember the love you gave me
Cause baby, baby I sure remember you
Baby, baby, baby, remember the love you gave me
Cause baby, baby I sure remember you
