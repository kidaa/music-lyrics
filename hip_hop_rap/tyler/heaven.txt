Written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe

In the middle of a sleepless night
Got a feeling and it just ain't right
The feeling just grows in my mind

Something's missing in the way we kiss
Never had so many nights like this
Feel's like a dream but it's true

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
Can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
Can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
Can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before

In the middle of a lonely day
Though you're with me you're so far away
We used to be close, real close

Baby can't you see the danger signs
A love like ours is hard to find
Something's gone wrong can't you see

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
Can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
Can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
Can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
Can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
Can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
