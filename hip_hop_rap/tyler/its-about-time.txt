Written by Scott and Wolfe

It's about time
You stop fooling around
Cause I can't go on loving like this
It's about time
You got closer to me
It's allright for a while then we're more than a mile apart

chorus
Are we just playing at lovers
Doing the right thing to do
I'm always running for cover
When I ought to be running to you
Sometimes you're more like a stranger
And baby I think I've lost you
Feels like I'm heading for danger
When I ought to be heading for you

It's about time
You stop fooling around
Cause I can't go on loving you like this

Instrumental

Chorus

It's about time
You stop fooling around
Cause I can't go on loving like this
It's about time
You got closer to me
It's allright for a while then we're more than a mile apart

Stop fooling around
Get closer to me
I'm always running for cover
What you're doing to me
It's about time
More than a stranger
It's allright for a while then we're more than a mile apart
