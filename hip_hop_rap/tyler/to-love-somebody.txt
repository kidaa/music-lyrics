Written by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, and Maurice Gibb

There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
There's a way, everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what good does it bring, if I ain't got you
If I ain't got you

You don't know what it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my pain, I see your face again
It's burning in my mind
You ain't got to be so blind that I'm alive
I'm a woman, can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do, if I ain't got you
If I ain't got you...
