Written by Scott and Wolfe

Here's Monday
And the day is just beginning
And the sun is in my eyes
And the overnight sensation of loving you so much
Has brought us to this morning of goodbyes

Here's Monday
And the truth is just beginning
To dawn up on my mind
The comfort of your body, the touching of your lips
Forevermore are leaving me behind

chorus
Goodbye my love
We came this far by being careful lovers
We came this far without once hurting others
Better leave ya now before we change our mind
Goodbye my love
We came this far without once hurting others
Better leave ya now before we change our mind

Here's Monday
And the day is just beginning
And your face is in my eyes
Just an ordinary morning somewhere in this world 
A little bit of heaven slowly dies

Chorus

Here's Monday
And the day is just beginning
And your face is in my eyes
Just an ordinary morning somewhere in this world
A little bit of heaven slowly dies
