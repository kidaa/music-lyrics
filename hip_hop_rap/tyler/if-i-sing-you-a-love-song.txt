If I sing you a love song
Will you always remember
Will you hear it on lonely nights
When I'm not around

If I sing you a love song
Will you hear it forever
To remind you how much I cared
And how I needed you

Love songs last longer
Than lovers ever do
So baby let me sing a love song for you

Love songs don't leave you
But lovers often do
Oh baby I'm afraid it could happen to me and you

If I sing you a love song
Let it always be with you
When the others have gone away
Let it still be there

Love songs last longer
Than lovers ever do
So baby let me sing a love song for you

Love songs don't leave you
But lovers often do
Oh baby I'm afraid it could happen to me and you

Oh-oh-oh
Oh lonely nights when I'm not around

Baby it's a love song

So always remember

Of lonely nights

I sing you a love song

To keep you close to me
