Written by David Yorath, Bonnie Tyler, and David Madiran

Can't wait until I'm in your arms 
Your kiss sets me on fire
I've never felt so alive
Come on and take me higher
I don't know what it is that makes
Me feel the way I do

Bridge:
But - you're the one that's always
Been on my mind
And I'll be there when you want me to

Chorus:
Whenever you need me, I'll come u=running
Whenever you want me, only I will be there
Whenever you need me , for the good times and bad
Anytime, anywhere, I don't care
I will be there

I'm the one you're with tonight
This love will never die
Just one touch drives me insane
It makes me want to cry
I'm feeling hot inside and I can't
Control the way I feel

Bridge 2:
But - I keep you up whenever you are feeling down
And I hope you'll always want me around

Chorus 2:
Whenever you need me, to be your lover
Whenever you want me, just one call I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be the best you've ever had
Anytime, anywhere, I s]don't care
I will be there

Whatever you want me to
Whenever you repeat

Double chorus and ad libs

Whenever you need me, I'll come running
Whenever you want me, only I will be there
Whenever you need me, for the good times and bad
Anytime, anywhere, I don't care
I will be there

Whenever you need me, I'll come running
Whenever you want me, just one call I'll be there
Whenever you need me, for the good times and bad
Anytime, anywhere, I don't care
I will be there
