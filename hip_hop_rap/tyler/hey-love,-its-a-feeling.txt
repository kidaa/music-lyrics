This love you give me baby
I do believe in
'Cause while the world goes crazy
You keep me breathing
And if you had to leave me
I couldn't let you
And the way that my arms have held you
They can't forget you

Hey love, it's a feeling inside
Hey love, it's a feeling that I can't describe
Hey love, it's a feeling that I just can't hide
Now I know, Lord how I know
Now I know what ti's like

This love you give me baby
Ooh, keep on giving
'Cause while the world goes crazy
You keep me living
And if you had to leave me
I couldn't let you
And the way that my arms have held you
They can't forget you

Hey love, it's a feeling inside
Hey love, it's a feeling that I can't describe
Hey love, it's a feeling that I just can't hide
Now I know, Lord how I know
Now I know what it's like

Hey love, it's a feeling inside
Hey love, it's a feeling that I can't describe
Hey love, it's a feeling that I just can't hide
Now I know, Lord how I know
Now I know what it's like

Hey love, it's a feeling inside
Hey love, it's a feeling that I can't describe
Hey love, it's a feeling that I just can't hide
Now I know, Lord how I know
Now I know what it's like
