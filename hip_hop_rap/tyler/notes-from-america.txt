Written by Desmond Child and Robbie Seidman

Somewhere in America
The tour bus roars through the dead of night
You know what I mean
Here it comes and goes so fast
Lookin' out this window
Sometimes I wish that I was back
And this was all a dream

I been up and down
I been lost and found
In America, in America
I been turned around 
Till I don't know where I'm bound
In America, in America
And I miss you now
Just a note from America...

Livin' on the road again
I'm the only woman
In this rock and roll band
Fifty stated of one night stands
You know what I mean
Railroad crossing, midnight train
Just the lonely sound
Of the clickety-clack
Still I know I can't turn back
American dream...

I been up and down
I been lost and found
In America, in America
I been turned around
Till I don't know where I'm bound
In America, in America
And I miss you now
Just a note from America...

Sometimes when it gets to me
I dream that you are next to me
I can feel you near whisperin' my name
I can feel your touch take away my pain
I can hear you say,
"I just want to love you again"
Baby, baby
