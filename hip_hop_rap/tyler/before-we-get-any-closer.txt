Written by  R.J. Scott and C. Stevens

Before we get any closer
Before we let it begin
Before our feelings take over us
I wanna tell you one thing
I'm just an ordinary girl 
Who needs some love in my life
I won't pretend to be more than I am
I've had some lovers before
But now I need something more
Than just a meaningless holding of hands
I'm just an ordinary girl
Who wants to reach out and find
Someone who honestly feels like I do
Love is so fragile a thing
I'd sooner never begin
Than to find out too late it's not true

Before we get any closer
Before we tell any lies
Before we make any promises
We really ought to decide
Is this a casual affair
Two ships that pass in the night
Cold we find heaven out there just one time
Or are we closer than close
With deeper feelings than most
Could ever know for the whole of their lives

INSTRUMENTAL

Before we get any closer
Before we two become us
I need to know if you'll always be
Someone to totally trust
I'm just an ordinary girl
Who needs some love in my life
I won't pretend to be more than I am
I've had some lovers before
But now I need something more
Than just a meaningless holding of hands
Is this a casual affair
Two ships that pass in the night
Could we find heaven out there just one time
Or are we closer than close
With deeper feelings than most
Could ever know for the whole of their lives

I'm just an ordinary girl
Who wants to reach out and find
Someone who honestly feels like I do
Love is so fragile a thing
I'd sooner never begin
Than to find out too late it's not true
