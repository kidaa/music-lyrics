I can't see in the dark, but I see you
Words don't come from your heart, but they get through
Something's happened to you
Something's happened to me
Someone's changing our lives
I know it isn't me

chorus
Get out of my head and get into my heart
Get out of my head and get into my heart
I thought it was love
But there's love and there's love
So get out of my head and get into my heart

Not much more I can do than what I've done
You shot me through the heart without a gun
Something's happened to you
Something's happened to me
Someone's changing our lives
I know it isn't me

Chorus

Instrumental

Something's happened to you
Something's happened to me
Someone's changing our lives
I know it isn't me

Chorus

Get out of my head and get into my heart
Get out of my head and get into my heart
Get out of my head and get into my heart
Get out of my head and get into my heart
Get out of my head and get into my heart
