Written by J. Blake

As the warm sun kissed the springtime
And the clouds drifted away
You'd walk along the sandy beach
Another endless day
As the summer turned to autumn
Nights are drawing in so near
Evenings laying by the fire
Love was truly here

chorus
And now you are cryin' a little
What happened girl?
What happened girl? 
Did they destroy your perfect world?
And now you are cryin' a little
What happened girl?
What happened girl?
Did they destroy your perfect world?

As the fall changed into winter
He took her breath away
Nights were long and bitter cold
She saw the light of day
With the end of all four seasons
Oh, things have moved so fast
The romance that was her's forever
Has melted with the past

repeat chorus

The love that you crave for
Won't come so easily now
Oh seasons change and so do we

chorus and fade
