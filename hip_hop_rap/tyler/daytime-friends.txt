Written by Dieter Bohlen

Some friends you lose
Some friends you win
Time will heal the pain
I would give up everything
To hold you once again
Sorry doesn't make it right
And tears are not enough
I can't take these lonely nights
In shadows from this love

chorus
We are daytime friends and nighttime fools
Oh nobody takes the place of you
Oh a woman is a mans best friend in this world, baby
We are daytime friends and nighttime fools
Oh baby, breaking up is hard to do
I have golden days and restless lonely nights with you, darling

Oh heaven knows where heaven is
How does this love survive
Try a little tenderness to keep this love alive
Nights begin to drive me down
It's waiting in my heart
Oh love it makes the world go round
But we're so far apart

repeat chorus

I'm missing your sweet tender kiss
I'm missing you tonight babe
All I wants your sweet caress
there's nothing left to hide baby

last half than all of chorus
