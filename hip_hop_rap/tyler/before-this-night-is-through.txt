Written by Beppe Cantarelli and Adrienne Anderson

I been crazy for you, so long
How could something so right turn out so wrong
Words, never mean what they say
Words just get in the way

Before this night is through
Gonna make you see
How I been blind to you
You been blind to me
Before this night is through we're gonna get to the truth

Before this night is through
Gonna heal the pain
Before this night is through
You'll be back again
No matter what we do I know we'll be all right
Before this night is through

Hearts broken in pieces no time to mend
Without loving they fall apart in the end
Fools, never admit they're wrong
They live their lives alone

Before this night is through
Girl we're gonna see how I belong to you
You belong to me
Before this night is through we're gonna get to the truth

Before this night is through
We'll get past the pain
Before this night is through
You'll be back again
No matter what we do I know it'll be all right
Before this night is through

Come inside close the door come tome now
We'll find our way we know how
Let the past be the past let it all fall away
Baby I know we told lies and to lie is a sin
We'll get to the truth we will simply begin

INSTRUMENTAL

Before this night is through we're gonna get to the truth

Before this night is through
We'll get past the pain
Before this night is through
You'll come back again
No matter what we do I know we'll be all right
Before this night, before this night is through
