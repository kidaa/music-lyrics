Written by Dieter Bohlen

Race to the fire
Oh, the wheels are turning
Oh, we're all just in a lonely world
Yeah, baby

Baby, love is a lonely number
Can't you hear the wheels of thunder
They're driving deep into your heart
Feelings they'll never be torn apart
Maybe he's the man behind the wire
He's living in a world of fire
He's sailing his ship alone
There's a heart, but there's no home

chorus
Race to the fire
Oh, the wheels are turning
Oh, we're all just in a lonely world
Till the end of the time
He's fighting the crime
That's no lie my baby
Race to the fire till the end of eden
To the city of the lost and found
He's too proud to cry-hard to live with a lie
Take him seriously baby
Race to the fire - Fire!
Race to the fire - Fire!
Race to the fire - He's fighting for your rights
Race to the fire - Fire!
Race to the fire - Fire!
Race to the fire - only the strong survive

Maybe he's going through the motions
There's a shadow of devotion
It's showing his destiny - One minute passed eternity
Oh, maybe good things don't last forever
He's living just now or never
No mountain is high enough
Times are getting really tough

chorus

Race to the fire - fighting for your rights
Race to the fire - time is on his side
Race to the fire - two hearts collide
Race to the fire - there is no crime

1/2 chorus
