Written by Howard Houston

Heartaches and so much pain
Cry out to you in vain
I'll keep my promises sweet darling
Don't let this sweet love die
So many reasons why
I'll keep my promises, oh darling, oh yeah
I'll wait for you my sweet love

chorus
Years my come and years may go
Still there's one thing that I know
That my heart is only beating just for you, darling
Only a fool would let you go
And I will always love you so
For my heart is only waiting just for you

Time passes by so slow
With every hour yeah I know
I'll keep my promises sweet darling
The stories that you'll hear
Jealous words have no fear
I'll keep my promises sweet darling
Oh, are you dying my sweet love

repeat chorus twice then fade
