Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit lonely 
and you're never coming round
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit tired 
of listening to the sound of my tears
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit nervous 
that the best of all the years have gone by
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit terrified 
and then I see the look in your eyes
Turnaround bright eyes, 
Every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes, 
Every now and then I fall apart

Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit restless 
and I dream of something wild
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit helpless 
and I'm lying like a child in your arms
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit angry 
and I know I've got to get out and cry
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit terrified 
but then I see the look in your eyes
Turnaround bright eyes, 
Every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes, 
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow
on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and
I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and
giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

Turnaround bright eyes
Turnaround bright eyes
Turnaround, Every now and then I know you'll never be the
boy you always wanted to be
Turnaround, Every now and then I know you'll always be
the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turnaround, Every now and then I know there's no one in the
universe as magical and wonderous  as you
Turnaround, Every now and then I know there's nothing any
better and there's  nothing I just wouldn't to do

Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
