Written by Alan Parsons, and Eric Woolfson

I can see the glow
Of the distant sun
I can feel it inside
Maybe this day
Could be the one
I can hear the roar
Of the distant crowd
They are waiting for me
Calling my name
Shouting out loud

Limelight
You were all I ever wanted since it all began
Limelight
Shining on me
Telling the world who I am
Oh, limelight
Don't let it slip right through your fingers
There's a long way to fall
After all the years of waiting
I'm gonna show them all

I can see the world
In a different light
Now it's easy to say
Where I went wrong
What I did right
Holding on
Isn't always easy
I ain't gonna change my mind

Limelight
You were all I ever wanted since it all began
Limelight
Shining on me
Telling the world who I am
Oh, limelight
Don't let it slip right through your fingers
There's a long way to fall

Limelight
You were all I ever wanted since it all began
Limelight
Shining on me
Telling the world who I am
Oh, limelight
Don't let it slip right through your fingers
There's a long way to fall
Maybe the roads not easy
I'm gonna show them all
