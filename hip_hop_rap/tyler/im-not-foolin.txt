Now I've known for a while
There's been something going on
And I've been getting the impression
That I'm not the only one
And if that's the way you want it
Then you'll have to man anew
So listen while I tell you
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't want you to lie to me
Cause I won't take it anymore
And if I find that you cheat on me
I'm just gonna walk right out the door

Chorus
I'm not foolin'
I'm not foolin' anymore
I've got my eyes wide open
Gonna even up the score
I'm not foolin'
No, I'm not foolin'
I'm not foolin'
Oh, not anymore

I can't stop thinking 
How you hurt me once before
And I'm acting kind of crazy
Cause I feel so insecure
Cause I gave you all the lovin'
That a man could ever need
I'm a one man woman
That's the way I'll always be
You better try to understand
Why it's just gotta be this way
And if you know what's good for you
You better take notice of what I say

Repeat Chorus in various orders
