What I need
Is what you got
And a man like you could surely have a lot
It's what I need
So now you know
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

What you see
Is what you get
And the best of my loving you know you ain't seen nothing yet
Hold on tight
Don't let go
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

The fire below
the fire below
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below
The fire below
The fire below
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

When I play
It's not a game
I've got nothing to lose, but you've sure got a lot to gain
Come on, come on, come on
I'm ready to go
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

The fire below
The fire below
It takes a whole of loving to put out the fire below
The fire below
The fire below
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

Ooh, yeah

Instrumental

Ooh

If you take me up
I won't bring you down
I can't lie and fooling and I won't take no messing around
Come on, come on, come on
I'm ready to go
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

The fire below
The fire below
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below
Come on, come on, come on
You know I'm ready to go
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below

The fire below
The fire below
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below
Come on, come on, come on
You know I'm ready to go
It takes a whole lot of loving to put out the fire below, whoa
