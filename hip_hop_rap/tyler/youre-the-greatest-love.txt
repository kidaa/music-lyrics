Written by Howard Houston, Steve Benson, and Bonnie Tyler

You got the look of love
Oh, from heaven above
Your cool blue eyes are killing me
I'm hooked on you
You're my fantasy
Oh, when two hearts collide
There is no place to hide
Tell me your dreams
I'll tell you mine
To lose this love would be a crime

chorus
You're the greatest love
The greatest of all
I'll be there whenever you call
You're my one and only
Baby when I'm lonely
Just the thought of you it drives me wild
You're the greatest love 
The greatest of all
I'll be there whenever you call
You're my one and only
Baby when I'm lonely
Just the thought of you it drives me wild

I save my heart for you
See what a love can do
A lonely night in a tough, old town
It breaks my heart
When the lights go down
Can't you see I'm dying
They'll be no reason why
Tell me your dreams
I'll tell you mine
To lose this love would be a crime

CHORUS

Don't stop loving - don't stop crying
I'll give my heart - never see me crying
Don't stop loving - don't stop at all
I'll always be around
Whenever you fall

CHORUS

You're the greatest love
