Written by R.J. Lange, A. Mitman, and C. Joiner

I think you like it a lot
I think you like what you see
I know you like what you got
Babe, cause what you got is me
This heart, these hands
Are made to understand
This girl, and that man
If we don't make it no one can

chorus
Oh baby, I cry myself to sleep at night
I'm so in love
Cause I cry myself to sleep at night
I'm all shook up
Cause I cry myself to sleep at night
This woman is in love

I think you like a little solo
A little one on one
A little old fashioned feel good
Make me emotionally numb
This heart, these hands
Are made to understand
This girl and that man
If we don't make it no one can

CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL

This heart, these hands
Are made to understand
This girl and that man
If we don't make it no one can

CHORUS X 2 And fade
