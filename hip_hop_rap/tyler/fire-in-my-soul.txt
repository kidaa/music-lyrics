Written by Steve Benson

verse one

I was so in love, then you broke my heart
I'll never understand the rules of love
You said to me true love never dies
You said to me
Now I'm sleeping with a memory

Yeah

chorus

There is a fire in my soul
Burning don't you know
Can you hear it on the radio
Fire in my soul
Out of my control
Said you loved me then you let me go
Oh Oh
Can you hear it on the radio
Oh Oh
Can you hear it on the radio

verse two

Just like a dream you are mine
When I saw you the very first time
You looked at me with those eyes
You said you loved me I believed your lies
Whey do you keep me hanging on the line
The love you gave me's just a waste of time
There's a fire burning up my soul

Repeat Chorus

bridge

I was so in love, then you broke my heart
No No this love will never die

verse three

I should have seen should have known
When you told me you had to go
So naive you know
You burn me up and then you let me go
Why do you keep me hanging on the line
The love you gave me's just a waste of time
There's a fire burning up my soul

Repeat Chorus Twice
