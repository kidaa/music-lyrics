What a way to treat my heart
You picked it up you broke it in half
What a way to let me know
You took my love and you let it go
What a way to treat my heart
Ooh what a way, what a way to treat my heart

I don't know much about 
My feelings without you with me
I can't tell you what it's like 
To spend each night alone
Don't understand what went wrong
We should've gone on and on

What a way to treat my heart
Ooh what a way
What a way to treat my heart

Like a star in the sky
You were someone who I looked up to
My direction was clear
When you were here with me
I don't understand what went wrong
We should've gone on and on
