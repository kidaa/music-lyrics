Ocean...Ocean

In the darkness of nowhere there's nothing at all
And I feel like I've been here too long
Shadows and teardrops fading away
And my heart is crying for love

Far from the moments when my eyes were so closed 
And my heartbeat was longing for more
Way over mountains higher than high
I could feel the breeze from below

Like an ocean
Like an ocean

Now tell me your secrets come closer and whisper
I feel like I've seen you before
There's no more illusions no more escapes 
Cause I'm tired of asking for more
Seems like a lifetime fading away 
I'm lost in an ocean of love
I'm reaching and holding on to my dreams
Cause I'm not alone anymore

Like an ocean
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean
Way over mountains higher than high

Spoken:  
Far from those moments when my eyes were so closed
Way over mountains higher than high
I could feel the breeze from below
It's like an ocean ocean hey

Like an ocean
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean
Way over mountains higher than high

Like an ocean
Way over mountains higher than high 
Like an ocean
Way over mountains higher than high
