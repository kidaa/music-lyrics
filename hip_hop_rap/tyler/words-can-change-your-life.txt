Written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe

Words are all that we can say
They change you life or just a day
It all depends upon the say we say them
Words can sparkle like a star
In a letter from afar
It doesn't matter where you are they touch you
Words dancing in your head
Words you'd wish you'd said
When you had the chance to say them
Words whispered in the night
Makes the world seem right
When you're looking for the answers
Words when the day has gone
Sometimes linger on
And haunt you like a love song
Words, words we mean to say
Somehow slip away
Tell me why they stay behind our lips
Words can be the sweetest song
The kind that makes you sing along
When everything is going wrong around you
Words, words can change your life
Cut you like a knife
Even though he really loves you
Words when the day has gone
Sometimes linger on
And haunt you like a love song
Words, words we mean to say
Somehow slip away
Tell me why they stay behind our lips
