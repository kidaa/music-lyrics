Written by Steve Benson

Love will always find a way
Feelings are the hardest words to say
Oh, call me - call me
Babe, I always call your name
I would never feel this way again
Oh, call me - call me
There's love enough - enough for two
There will never be another you
How can you mend a broken heart
Oh you said goodbye without a tear
There are a million souls - a million fears
That's no way to say goodbye, oh

Call me - call me
Tell me what you feel
My love never dies my love never dies
Call me - call me
Tell me what you feel
You light up my life you light up my life

I'll be there if you want me
I'm living with my memories
Oh, call me - call me
From the bottom of your heart
You swore we'd never break apart
Oh, call me - call me
Oh, hold on tight - don't let go
If you love me let me know
I never had a love like ours

chorus

I'm never gonna give you up
Why did you break my lonely heart
My world begins and ends with you
If there's one thing that I know
Babe, I'll never let you go
Babe, I sold my heart to you

chorus 2 1/2 times
