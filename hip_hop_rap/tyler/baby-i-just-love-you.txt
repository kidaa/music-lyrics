Written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe

Baby I just love you
Baby I just love you
When it comes right down 
To what it's all about
I couldn't let you go

I don't know what's right or wrong
But in my heart's where you belong
And when the feeling's right it's right
I never felt this close before
When I'm with you I need no more
When the feeling's right it's right

Baby I just love you
Baby I just love you
It doesn't matter what I say and what I do
I still come back to you

I never felt this close before
When I'm with you I need no more
When the feeling's right it's right
