From the March 1991 San Remo Song Contest

Here I Am Alone On the Edge
Wishing I Could Fly
Can't Understand the Drifting Sand
That Drifts On By

Thought You'd Start Spending the Night
Wishing When I Cry
Each Time I Find I'm Running Blind
From My Hurt Inside

The Dark This Way
The Light Escapes
Couldn't Face the Pain
Couldn't Face the Shame
And Now I Know Just What I'll Find
I Can't Go On Without Your Love
To Find Me Though This Endless Night

chorus
If I Could Walk With You To Bridge This Fallen Dream
If You Would Take My Hand To Lead Me From This Place
Then I Could Make It To the Light
If I Could Take Your Hand And Lead Me To This Place
If I Could Run With You Across This Bloody Race
That We've Loved Before

And This Endless Night
And This Endless Night
And This Endless Night

Reaching Out For What We Could Have Trying To Survive
The Words That We Said Fill My Head 
And Echo Through This Wasted Heart
I Can't Go On Without Your Love
To See Me Through This Endless Night
Endless Night
