Written by Dieter Bohlen

Rain is such a lonely sound
Pouring on the ground
You're slipping away
You're slipping away
Driving through the midnight rain
Oh, I call your name
You're slipping away
Day after day
You're like a candle in the wind
Why don't you stay?

chorus
Take a chance and thats forever
We could be so good together
Take a chance, the greatest love is in your hands
Take a chance and be my lover
There will never be another
Take a chance, my lonely heart is in your hands

Please don't tell me it's the end
And we can be friends
You're slipping away
You're slipping away
If you ever change your mind
Oh, I'll give you time
You're slipping away
Day after day
You're like a candle in the wind
Why don't you stay?

chorus

Take a chance and don't be cruel
Oh, I'm waiting just for you
Take a chance and take my soul
Take a chance, oh baby we should loose control

chorus
