Vrooom On A Yamaha Chromed Out 11 Hundred 
Wut Im Doin, Gettin Money, Wut We Doin, Gettin Money 
Wut They Doin, Hatin On Me, But They Neva Cross 
Cash Money Still The Company, And Bitch Im The Boss

Bitch Im Paid, Thats All I Gotta Say 
Cant See My Lil Nigga, The Money In The Way 
And Im, Im Sittin High, A Gansta Ride Blades 
If You Aint Gone Ride Fly Than You Might As Well Hate 
Shit I Gotta Eat... Even Though I Ate 
It Aint My Birthday But I Got My Name On My Cake 
Believe That, If Ya Mans Wanna Play 
Imma Fuck Around And Put That Boy Brains On The Table 
So Pick 'Em Up, Pop 'Em Let 'Em Lay 
Where Im From We See A Fuckin Dead Body Everyday 
Thats, Uptown, Throwin Stuff At 'Em 
Niggaz Talk About Me Im Throwin Shots Back At 'Em 
Bitch Im A Pipe, And She Like A Crack Attic 
And She Saw Me Cookin Eggs And She Though I Was Back At It 
I Grab The Keys, Hoe I Gotta Go 
I Got My Motorcycle Jacket And My Motorcycle Loafs
