Dro fuck with me!
Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'mma shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la bamba
See it's me on the interey
And my new drop is very water-melon plum
Just call it fruit punch
I'mma old rapper getting new bucks
And all you new rappers your just new lunch.
