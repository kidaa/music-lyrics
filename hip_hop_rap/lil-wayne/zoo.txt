[Verse:]
Young money mu'tha f**ka where the cash at
I put numbas on ya head like a class hat
See i dun been through everything like a lab rat

I stand before u bitch niggas with the 5th cocked
Boom boom!!!!

Bullet proof vest cannot defend tops
Wanna walk n my shoes u need 10 socks
But these niggas is actors like rick foxx
Stick 2 the script or f**k around and get written out
We in this mu'tha f**ka throwin up the sets

[Chorus x2: Lil Wayne]
And me and mack is just 2 niggas from the same hood

Bail fast in monroe be right at ya front door
Knock, knock, hello there goes several fellows
With clips to the elbows hellrose
And tell them niggas we was hustlin till hell froze

Or they could find yo ass part dead on father's day

[Chorus x1: Mack Maine]
