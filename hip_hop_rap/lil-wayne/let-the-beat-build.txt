Yea
I see you big boy
Ima kill these niggas man
Yea
Haha...straight off the block with it
Eagle street to be specific
I'm peeping at u people different
I'm payin dues, you keep the difference
I can see the end in the beginning
So i'm not racing, i'm just sprinting
Cuz I don't wanna finish
They diminish I replenish
Scientific, i'm out this world hoe
I wear bright red, like a girl toe, no homo
Fingernail dirty, I been countin dirty money since 12:30
A.m. weigh them, if they short take them right and back spray him 8 men
Yea, I can do my wayne,
And everytime I do it, I do my thang
Yea believe that, like a true story
Rims big make the car look like its two stories
If I hop out, that'll be suicide, no back seats
Call it paralyzed
I don't have a spine, I don't fantisize
I mastermind, then go after mine
U see I handle mine I dismantle mine
I told her tool box, bitch it's hammertime
So excuse me as I nail em, toss and scale em, just repel em
Ima kill em, someone tell em ima kill em
Ima fill em up, his mama can't tell em
And the doctors can't heal em
Ima kill em and resell em
I kno u smell em
If u want it, u can just yell it
Three in the morning at yo telly
Whole key go for 20, half a key go for 11
After me there will be nothing, I am legend
And I'm Will Smith
Now thats how u let the beat build bitch

Ok i'd like to thank kanye
And my nigga diesel for giving me this diesel
Like a F-350, tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
You can think my shit didn't stank boy but yall wrong
I'm pulling million dollar deals from my i-phone
Ima take it 1,2 way back
Like a silk wifebeater and a wavecap
Or the wave pool it blew by you
And I waved fool as I blew by you
Hello how are u, I can buy u, but I wouldn't try u
Feed u to pyru
