Well you looked so at peace
Trying to feel real love
You hair was like a fire
Such a pretty woman
You were hiding out in the open
Searching so hard
For a kiss that lasts forever
There on the boulevard
Do they use you
And then they lose you
When you get scared again They could never forget you
But they could say they said your name
Julia
Well there's gotta be somebody
Gets what it is you do
Knows about the business
Somebody who can see through
Someone unaffected
Someone unashamed
Of his woman being worshipped
When he's not in the frame
Do they use you
And then they lose you when you get scared again
They could never forget you
But they could say they said your name
Julia
