Case of tornadoes when you come around.
Everything that matters goes underground.
Tornadoes, every day.
And you're trying to blow me away.

Somethings going wrong in the galaxy
But it's all right, it's all right.
And anyone could see what you were doing to me.
But it's all right, it's all right.

And you had to know that i would crack
if you didn't think to ask
but you just kept coming back
Ooooooo.

Got a case of tornadoes
When you come around
Everything that matters goes underground
Tornadoes every day
And you're trying to blow me away

My crooked pieces fit yours perfectly
And it's all right it's all right
My headlines crowding out in front of me
But it's allright it's allright.

Then the room would flood with calm
And I would think the worst is gone
Then you interrupt my song
oh oh oh no, no.

A case of tornadoes
When you come around
Everthing thing that matters goes underground
Tornadoes every day
And you're trying to blow me away

And you get that look like you never knew
What part of my tears left you so confused?
And i think i'm just as blind as you
For holding on.

Tornadoes when you come around
Everything that matters goes underground
Tornadoes every day
And you're trying to blow me away.
Tornadoes when you come around
Everything that matters goes underground
Tornadoes when you come around
And you're trying to blow me away
No, yeah you're trying to blow me away
You try to blow me away
i'm not moving today.
No i'm not moving today

i'm not moving today
i'm not going away
no.
