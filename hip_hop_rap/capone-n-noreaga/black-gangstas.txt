Count them, every one
All of the million things You've done
You are the Lord of my life
And I roll them over and over
In my head, in my head
But I don't understand
But I'm glad You're in my life
And I lift you up so high
I forget about the world I'm living in
Lay it at your feet
I'm giving in
My joy inside
I cannot hide
I love to lift you up
Lord I love you
You're the Father's hand at night
You're the sunshine in the day
And I long to be with You
All my days
In old age if I'm still hanging around
I'll be found around with You
And I life you up so high
I love to lift You up
