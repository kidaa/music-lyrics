I thought I got the A-Z but now I'm lost
And I don't know where I'm going', I don't know what I'm looking for
I'm all burnt out
There ain't that much I care about
And I know I'm missing something
I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore

I won't let it get to me
But I really miss you badly

I wish I knew how I'm gonna be happy without you
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I thought I got it all mapped out but now I'm lost
In a world that ain't got you in I don't know what I'm living for
Hopeless without the only thing I cared about
Cos you've been my salvation in a place where there's no love anymore

I won't let it get to me
But I'm gonna miss you badly
I wish I knew how I'm gonna be happy without you
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

I wish I knew how I'm gonna be happy without you
In a different world without you

I wish I knew how I'm gonna be happy without you
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

I wish I knew how I'm gonna be happy without you
In a different world without you
