Ray Davies
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody 'til I met you
But you keep a me waiting all of the time
What can I do
It's your life and you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep a me waiting
Please don't keep a me waiting
'Cos I'm so tired of waiting
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
It's your life and you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep a me waiting
Please don't keep a me waiting
'Cos I'm so tired of waiting
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
