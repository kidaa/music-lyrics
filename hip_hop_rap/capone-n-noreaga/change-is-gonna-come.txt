[Carl Thomas]
I was born by the river.. in a little tent
No just like that river I've.. been running ever since
It's been a long.. a long time coming
but I knowowwwww.. a change gon' come
Oh yes it will..
It's been tooooooo hard living
but I'm afraid to die..
Cause I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky
It's been a long tiiiime.. a long time coming
but I knowowwwww.. a change gon' come
Oh yes it will..
And I go.. to my brother yes I do
And say, ";Brother - help me please"; well well
But he winds up, knocking me..
I got on my knees, oahhhoooohhhhh
There's been times, that I thought
I wouldn't last too long..
