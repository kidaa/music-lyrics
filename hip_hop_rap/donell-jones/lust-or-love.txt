[Verse 1]
There is something between us
Whenever we hook up it comes up out
I go through different emotions 
And I can't quite figure it out
If I just fight it
And we get down
Or have I fallen
For you in the mist of it all

[Chorus]
I dont know if it's lust or love
That I'm feeling for you
Hope you're feeling it too
I don't know but I hope it's love
That I'm feeling for you girl

[Brigde]
Baby I'm ready
To settle down
Have I been running
From love in this captional night

[Chorus x2]
I dont know if it's lust or love
That I'm feeling for you
Hope you're feeling it too
I don't know but I hope it's love
That I'm feeling for you girl

[Verse 2]
I've got love on my mind it's what I feel deep inside
As I look in your eyes I see that the lust has turn to love
Night after night we can make this thing right
Girl I need you in my life cuz you got to know that this could be love

[Chorus X4]
I dont know if it's lust or love
That I'm feeling for you
Hope you're feeling it too
I don't know but I hope it's love
That I'm feeling for you girl
