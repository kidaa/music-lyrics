[Intro]
Oh yeah ooh

[Verse 1]

I'd be chillin' with my boys at the won't you let me finish
How your girl gone tell you she saw me with some trick
But ain't told you she been trying to get with girl let me finish
I been trying to tell you for a while
But you never let me get what I'm trying to say out ooh
I always listen to what you got to say 
But for a change won't you shut up let me explain

[Chorus]
I will tell you I will tell you exactly where I was but you 
Keep cut cuttin' me off
Baby I will tell you I will tell you exactly who I was with but you
Cut cuttin' me off

Wasn't no late night show
And my spotless lie
'Cause without you 'Cause without you girl I'm lost I would say
But you keep cut cut cuttin' me cut cuttin' me off

Now I'm gone speak my mind and you gone let me finish
