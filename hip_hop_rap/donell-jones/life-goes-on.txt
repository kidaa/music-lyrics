[Donell Talking]
Damn man...I had it all before I got up in here

[Jail Bars Slam Shut]

Girl I know that you been creepin 
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters 
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

Since the day that I got locked up
My lifes been different.. oh yeah..
Cuz she was my soul, my heart, my love, my best friend
I can't understand why, 
She won't accept my phone calls..
Shoulda knew something was wrong 
When mama said "baby its time for you to move on..."
Now that everything I had.. is gone

Girl I know that you been creepin 
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters 
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

See I never thought that you would
Leave me dry and all alone
Cuz part of the reason I sit where I am
I was tryin to provide a home
Now I know that I'm not going to be there
Like I used to
But your promise to me 
Was that you never would leave
And that remains to be seen
I guess everything I had is lost and gone...

Girl I know that you been creepin 
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters 
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

See I had it all...
When I was on the streets
I gave you everything
Everything that you could want
Now that I'm locked away
With no where to turn
Now you wanna up and run
How could you do me wrong
All those precious times
That we used to share
Been thrown away
As far as I can see
See I gave my heart and soul
And now you turn away from me

Girl I know that you been creepin 
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters 
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on
