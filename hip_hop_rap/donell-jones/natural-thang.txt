Chorus
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right

Verse 1
You know that I want your love tonight
Cuz the feeling's oh so right
So take off your coat and settle down
Cause the time is now to move around
Every little fantasy
Girl, you got it with me
And if real love is what you want
Then you gotta come and get me on...

Bridge
Every day, every night ohoohoh
I long to have near me all the time All the time
Give me a chance to give you my love Give you my love
Everything will be all right
But you gotta keep me satisfied yeeeah

Chorus*

Verse 2
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
Boomin' O'Jays as we get it on
Girl, you know, that I've been waiting patiently patiently
I've been imaging thangs
That we can do
You just gotta give me a chance
To make sweet love, make sweet love to you.

Chorus*

Break it down...
