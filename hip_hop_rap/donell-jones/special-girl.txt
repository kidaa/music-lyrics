[Verse: Donell Jones]
I'm looking for that special girl, that special girl
All ya single ladies that look out for me
I'm the hottest single nigger to step on the scene
Got the east side rockin',
Got the mid west talking
Got the dirty south bouncin',
Got the west crib talking

The type a nigger that you wanna roll with baby
Dont get it twisted thinkin' i'm a sugar daddy
You can look like Halle with an ass like JLO
And a smile like Janet but thats not enough
You may think that i'm tripping take a minute and just listen
It aint all about sex 'cause I can always get that
I'm a million dollar nigger need a million dollar woman
Met this chick named Yvett and this what she said

[Verse: Yvette/Beverly]
I can give you everything you need
I can be your freak, even cook and clean
If thats all you got then you cannot get it
'coz i got a chef who can cook all my dinners
Im looking for that nigger who aint cheap,
Take me shopping every week
I play this game for ceeks

[Verse: Donell Jones]
If thats how you get down its a rap and your finnished
There aint no use in me gettin your digits
Im looking for that special girl

[Chorus: Yvette/Beverly/Donell Jones]
Your looking for me, I'm waiting on you
To bring your loving to me
that special girl
Come give it to me I'm waiting on you bring your loving to me i got what you need
im looking for that special girl
Your looking for me I'm waiting on you
To bring your loving to me

[Verse: Donell Jones]

So i hook up with this chick we call her Beverley
Had a trunk side body drove a chrome 600
With them big wheels gunnin

Type of chick that drop a platinum card for me
Just to show this nigger that her pockets deep
And the sex was blazin and her brain was crazy
Lingerie type lady stil thats not enough

You may think that I'm tripping take a minute and just listen

I'll watch you while you sleep
You will never leave boy
But that is somethin i just cant do it
