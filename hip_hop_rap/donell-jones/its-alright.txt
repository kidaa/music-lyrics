Let the telephone ring
It's about to get physical
It's just you and me on a late night creep
Plan on making you moan
But first let's get the mood right
I got the '76 Dom Perignon
And a dime bag of smoke so let's get it on
Come on

1 -     It's ok, it's alright
    We're gonna do it tonight
    Don't you worry 'bout a thing
    It's ok, it's alright
    We're gonna do it tonight

Get the bath water ready
It's about to get kinky
I imagine that body so soft
I won't know 'till you take your clothes off
Don't you be afraid
I wanna be your sex slave
Give you some lovin' kissin' and huggin'
You won't ask for nothin'
Oh no no no

Repeat 1
Don't you worry about a thing and
Repeat 1
Take it to the bridge, gonna take it to the bridge
Come on

Whatever we do ain't leavin' here
I got a million ways to love you
I'll be gentle so there's no need to fear
So come over here Come over here baby
I've been waiting for this for so long
Seems like I can't hold back this feeling
I'm on a mission to make you moan
So come, come on, come on

Repeat 1 

Yeah, I wanna make you moan
It's alright
Whatever we do aint' even here
You don't have to be afraid baby
No
Said it's 

Repeat 1 with ad lib until fade
