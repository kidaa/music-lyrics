1 - You should know
It's over now
Cuz I got another love
So I'm saying

You should know
It's over now
Cuz I got another love

Oh Chuck D'joy
Donell Jones
Baby Caesar
Bad Tip the bone
Kenny, please us
Oh, oh, watch how we do this ya'all
DJ, on

You never give me all your special time
You're too busy hanging out
That's not what my love's about
I gave my heart, my soul, my trust to you
Tried to play me for a fool
It's why I felt somebody new
You should know

Repeat 1

We don't have to play this game no more
I got someone new in my life
And she always treats me right
I don't even know why you still trying
Cuz there's no way I'm coming back
Girl it's way too late for that

Yo, oh, miss
I love way you flossed your pitch then
It's clay boy crush for women
Make a player want to hit on that
Spend on that
Make you little  C's  girlfriend a minute flat
Kinda knew you loved the limelight
Especially
When you eyes got bright
When you saw Frank White
But I didn't mind no
Good girls are hard to find though
I ain't stress it, I crushed it
Guess it got outta control
When I saw your girl Nicole
She said gettin my dough
Was your main goal
Crack me for a mink soon as it got cold
I had Biggie on the line while she had you on hold
I asked Frank
He admitted
That he hit it
If I was catching villians, quit it
So I did it
I had to let it go like Teddy P
Cuz I'll be damned if I have a bronze dressing me

I need someone right there with me
You just don't have that quality
I'm tryin to give you everything
But you couldn't love me
So I'm saying

Repeat 1

You should know
It's over now
Yeah, hey

You should know
So baby got a new love

Repeat 1

Until fade
