1 - I don't want to bore you with my trouble and yeah
But there's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

There's something 'bout your loving
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

2 - And I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 

More and more, yeah, oh

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree
That's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you
That only our two hearts can find

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 until fade
