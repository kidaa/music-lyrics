[Verse 1]

Listen girl, its getting hot in here
And ya making me feel
Like you wanna do something, oh girl
Whats on your mind
I cant take much more of this bumpin and grindin

Don't stop watcha doing to me
Baby you gone make me want you even more
Act just like you want me, back that ass up on me
We can take this party, to my place or yours

[Chorus:]

All up on me playin it close
You cant stop it wont stop rollin?
Shorty what you feelin like
You can come and spend the night
