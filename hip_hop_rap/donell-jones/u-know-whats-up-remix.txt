[Donell]Left Eye 
What up? What up? Say what? Say what? Say what? uh-huh 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
Uh, uh, uh, Left Eye 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
Donell Jones 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
Ooh girl you know what's up 

[Donell] 
Me and my niggaz be rolling 
Trailing on you and your homies 
The very first day of summer 
All chromed out in a hummer babe 
Hit the park and parle 
Hope that your off is away 
Cause you and your girls wanna ride 
Play all day, puff on the lye 

1 - [Donell] 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
You know that I like it baby 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
And you know what I need 
Ooh say what, say what, say what 
You know that I'm bout it baby 
Ooh girl you know what's up 
Ooh 

2 - [Donell] 
I'm digging you, I'm feeling you 
And you know what's up 
Said I'm big on you and I'm wanting you 
So tell me what's up 

Be 'bout five niggaz zoning 
Running around two in the morning 
Looking fly with that sun dress on 
I think I feel a bone coming on 
Girl you got me wide open 
Fiending all day and I'm hoping 
So baby don't front 
Back seat jeep, you know what I want 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 

[Left Eye] 
Uh, say what? say what? say what? 
So baby tell me what's up 
Can we ascend to higher heights 
And when the path gets rough 
We can give into Friday nights breath we peace 
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap 
Our souls to keep 
The passion's deep and filled with heat 
Living this life on the hustle I barely get enough time 
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine 
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world 
A reputation known as the untouchable girl 
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways 
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days 
Now we can play, past ways, or just ain't got time 
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine 
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by 
You and I don't need permission to be unified 
Surely I done seen and heard a million places 
Then I travel around the world, see many faces 
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true 
You can show me that nobody else can do it better than you 
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got 
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots 

Repeat 2 till end
