[Intro]
Man
What am I say this time
She already heard the one about staying at work late
I already gave her the script about hanging out with the boys
Huh, guess I messed up this time
I'll face the music

I see that you're leaving
After giving you everything in the world
Like a brand new Benz, a laced out crib
A pocket full of dough and your baby got milk
Girl why you're trippin', cuz I stayed out late at night
But I locked my keys in my car
After getting off work, I didn't think to call

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you 
And that's all I got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your questions could be the end

So you think I've been cheating, yeah
Even though we've been through this type of shit before
But I told you then, that I changed my ways
Baby, believe me cuz I'm not guilty
Don't let this tear us apart
Cuz I don't wanna lose your love
Girl, I promise you it won't happen again
You can trust in me, just don't let this end
Girl, I'm innocent

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you 
And that's all I got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your questions could be the end

Oh yes, said I'm guilty for loving you 
And that's all I got to prove
Baby girl, I'm innocent
Guilty for trying to change
Baby, don't walk away
Girl, I'm innocent

Guilty for loving you
And that's all I got to prove
Baby girl, I'm innocent
Guilty for trying to change
Baby, don't walk away
Girl, I'm innocent

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you 
And that's all I got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your questions could be the end

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you 
And that's all I got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your questions could be the end

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you 
And that's all I got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your questions could be the end
