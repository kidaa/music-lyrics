[Intro]
Whassup, baby
This is a night that you'll never forget
Huh, for all the things that you desire
I got it right here, baby
Guess what
I'm back, I'm back

Baby, the mood is right
And the stars are out tonight
I can't wait 'till you get home
I got some rose petals leading to the bedroom door
Where I'm waiting all alone with candles lit
Glass of Perignon
Wanna make you lose control
Girl I'm telling you, tonight is yours
All I wanna know is

Do you wanna love me
Gonna give you the reason so you can love me forever, babe
I wanna make love, babe
Make your temperature rise until you say it's too hot, babe
Do you wanna feel me
Touchin' and rubbin' and lovin' all of your body
It's just you and me, baby
Gonna tickle your spot until you tell me to stop, babe

Passionate as can be, as I softly kiss your ear
I'm gon' give you what you want
Straight to the highest peak
Let me be your ecstasy
This gon' last the whole night long
As we become one, smell of love is strong
Want you to feel it in your soul
Girl I'm telling you, tonight is yours
All I wanna know is

Do you wanna love me
Gonna give you the reason so you can love me forever, babe
I wanna make love, babe
Make your temperature rise until you say it's too hot, babe
Do you wanna feel me
Touchin' and rubbin' and lovin' all of your body
It's just you and me, baby
Gonna tickle your spot until you tell me to stop, babe
