Baby you know I love you
But you know right now, you know its just getting to be too much
Ooh yeah
I really dont wanna go

Listen...
It was back in 99 I was a real nigga
Took you and your shorty in just to deal witcha
In the beginning it was rough
Cause sumtin was missing that he love
Hes always acting up
Baby Ive had enough
Dont need no child support cause I provided
Bought him anything that he wanted you cant deny it
Ive always treated him like
Hes coming between our love
What yawl got I cant mess up

[Chorus Repeat 2x]
Maybe in another life
We can be together
Promise that next time wont leave you ever
Maybe in another life
The sun will shine forever
With you in my life no more stormy weather

I got to walk away
Look at the big picture
A son needing his mother
Is the real issue
Im not a selfish guy
You know I want you in my life
Its killing me inside
Dont wanna say goodbye
Cant even show affection cause he dont like it
Every time we get romantic we gotta hide it
The way we living aint right
Hes coming between our love
What yawl got I cant mess up

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

Listen to me lady...
I cant come between a son and a mother
Its unfortunate that this is over
You dont leave me any choice
This could end up in divorce
Take a nigga straight to court
This decision is the best yeah..
And Im sorry it had to end this way know what Im talkn bout
In this relationship I can not stay
I can see that this is it
It aint nothing we can fix
Should be living for you kid
And maybe in another life

[Repeat Chorus]
