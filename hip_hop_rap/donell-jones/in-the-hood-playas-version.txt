Chorus 
This is for my playas in the hood 
Up to no good, let's kick it like we really should 
It's just an ordinary day 

Verse 1 
As I step on the scene, yo I'm steady maxin' 
And I call up my boys 'cause I'm looking for some action 
We need to kick it like we used to 
Back in the days when we were known as a crazy crew 
It's good to reminisce on the old days 
When we used to kick it with the G's and the homies 
I would go back, yo if I could 
This is for my people that's still rollin' round in the hood 

Chorus 

Verse 2 
Heads up on that ride she's a hottie 
All the fellas break wide to summer bunnies 
That's the way that we flex, yeah 
Everyday on the O.G. set 
But keep it smoove 
I'll keep it smoove on the move spit to the hotties 
On a late night move to flex their bodies 
That's the way that we hang 
On a regular doing our own thang 

Chorus 

Bridge 
This is for the playas in the hood, up to no good 
As we're rolling around , and we're doing our thang 
This is for the playas in the hood, up to no good 
As we're rolling around, and we're doing our thang 

Chorus
