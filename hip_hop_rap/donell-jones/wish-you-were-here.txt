Chorus 
I've got this longing for you 
Even when I call your name 
How I wish you were here 
A never-ending story of loneliness and pain 
Oh, how I wish you were here 

Verse 1 
It's been so long since I saw your face 
And I'm missing your warm embrace 
Recapturing the times that we shared 
Oh, baby..., how I wish you were here 

Chorus 

Verse 2 
Holding hands, feeling your sweet lips 
Brings me back to when we first met 
What we had was not what we thought it would be 
I would let nothing come between you and me 

Bridge 
All this time tell me where did it go 
You and me, you said we'll always be together 
Can't you see how I'm hurting inside 
Won't you please 
Baby, come back to me, yeah...
