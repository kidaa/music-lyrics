Gotta do what I gotta do 
Do what I gotta do 
Cause catch use everything around me 

Take a look around 
Take a look at was goin' down 
If u can see what I see, baby 
Why act the way I do 
Cause u can understand 
And u don't really know a man 
I've to turn and i've been 
Loose the things I've lost 
And can u change the way that u look at me 

1- All that u can say to me 
the things I just can say nomore 
What I say is got and I use to be 
We don't need the dog nomore 

Donna give up everyday 
Donna wing home of my pain

He thug just keep my baby at the ghetto 

2- Gotta do what I gotta do 
Move when it's time to move 
See what I gotta see 
Cause catch use everything around me 
Do what I gotta do 
Be who I gotta be

Cause we can live without enough money 

She is afraid to get involved 
She know her in a fallin love 
I see u wrist take in a big mistake 
By the way I made my livin' 
But I let u know from the door 
That's the way it is 
And that's the way it goes 
Only like I know 
To think nothing has changed that day 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 2 
Repeat 2

Look at if my point of view 
Laugh in this world as free 
So I do what I gotta do 
Dignity, use big cars and big planes

The fun thing, baby what u think? 
It was coming from stop at the gum

So don't act like u don't understand 

Repeat 2
