Yo yo what's up
Oh oh oh 
You know you got something I want you know
You ready baby

[Verse 1]
It's only been a day 
And I ain't trying to wait no more
Oh na na na
Cuz I'm going show you things that you never seen before
Oh na na na 
Girl I know a place where we can go for love

[Hook]
Girl it's right here
And it's right now
And it won't be long before I lay it down
Say oh your na na na na na

Cuz i'm going get it if your with it
Cuz i'm ready for that oh na na your na na oh

[Chorus]
Baby cuz I want it 
And when you bring it here i'm jumping on it
Girl i'm only into pleasing tonight
You ain't gotta ask for nothing 
Just as long as you can keep you can keep it coming
You've got it 
Girl I can't wait to taste your hypnotic
Girl I wanna make a baby tonight
You ain't gotta ask for nothing 
Cuz as long as you can take it

It's all about me pulling your hair
