Verse 1 
I see us in the park strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head 
And words from my heart told only to the wind 
Felt even without being said 

Bridge 
I don't wanna bore you with my troubles 
But there's something 'bout your love 
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet 
There's something 'bout your love 
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet 
Knocks me off my feet 

Chorus 
I don't wanna bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't wanna bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 

More and more 

Verse 2 
We lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree 
That seems through the eyes of my mind 
I reach out for the part of me that lives in you 
That only our two hearts can find 

Bridge 

Chorus out
