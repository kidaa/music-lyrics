Chorus 
Baby, I'm yearnin' for your love 
Baby, I'm yearnin' 
And my heart is thinking lust 
So just keep it coming 
Baby, I'm yearnin' for your love 
Baby, I'm yearnin' 
And my heart is thinking lust 
So just keep it coming 

Verse 1 
I don't wanna play around 
Come and get some of my love 
You'll feel the bomb when I explode 
So give me your love and let me lose control 
Ain't no humpin' round like Bobby Brown 
See I come smooth with a mellow groove to soothe 
And I can't be wasting your time 
'Cause straight up, I gotta go for mine 

Chorus 

Verse 2 
Now that I got you in the mood 
Don't you turn away 
'Cause I got lots of love in store 
Just what you need and so much more 
My mission is to please you 
So let's do what we're here to do 
I need some sexual healing like Marvin Gaye 
All night loving till the break of day 

Chorus 

Bridge 
Keep the lovin' coming till the break of day 
I'm yearnin' for your love 
Yearnin', yearnin' for your love 
Keep the lovin' coming till the break of day 
I'm yearnin' for your love 
Yearnin', yearnin' for your love 

Chorus
