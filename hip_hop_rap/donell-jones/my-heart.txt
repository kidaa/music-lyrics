Chorus 
Why you wanna play around with my heart 
You make me feel like you care 
Why you wanna play around with my heart 
My love was there I thought that you cared 

Verse 1 
Until that day you turned and walked away 
Your love was special to me 
My heart has fallen apart and I know 
That you're the one to blame 
You said the love would never change 
Then you go out and play 

Chorus 

Verse 2 
I never knew that you could put me through 
All the pain tha I feel, yeah 
Saying sorry won't make it right 
Cause it will never be the same you're the one to blame 
Tell me why 

Tell me why you're living a lie 
You never really loved me, baby 
And now my heart is falling apart 
You should have told me from the start 
That you would break my heart, baby 

Chorus/Vamp out
