Chorus 
Waiting on you 
I'm not going to 
I won't be waiting on you no more 
Waiting on you 
I'm not going to 
I won't be waiting on you no more 

Verse 1 
I know you're getting tired 
Of what I put you through 
But it's not the same way 
That's what I used to do 
Now I want you back 
So, girl, I've changed my ways 
Please stop frontin' on me 
Why you wanna do me this way 

Hook 
I can take it  Oh..., yeah  
I can fake it  I won't be playin' no more  

Chorus 

Verse 2 
Why can't you just believe 
That things are different now 
I'll do whatever it takes 
Let me show you how 
There will never be 
No other girl for me 
Just give me one more chance 
You know I'll make it last 

Hook 
I can't take it  Oh..., yeah  
I can't fake it  And I won't be playin' no games  

Chorus 

Break it down... 

Why do you wanna do this to me 
Oh, oh..., yeah, yeah, yeah... 

Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait, waiting for you 
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait, waiting for you 
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait, waiting for you 
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait, waiting for you 

Chorus/Vamp Out
