I said I left my babygirl a message
Saying I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cuz I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her 
But I need some time to be alone

1 -    But when you love someone
    You just don't treat them bad
    Oh how I feel so sad
    Now that I wanna leave
    She's crying her heart to me
    How could you let this be?
    I just need time to see
    Where I wanna be
    Where I wanna be

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby, oh no no

Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go
I think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone
But I have to find what life is like
Without you

Repeat 1

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby

2 -    Say when you love someone
    You just don't treat them bad
    Oh how I feel so sad
    Now that I wanna leave
    She's crying her heart to me
    How could you let this be?
    I just need time to see
    Where I wanna be

Repeat 2
Repeat 2

I'm sorry baby
