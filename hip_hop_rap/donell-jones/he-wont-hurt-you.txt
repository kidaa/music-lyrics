He don't treat you like he used to
Cuz he got somebody else
Girl I feel for you cause you're all by yourself, yeah
Don't you shed a tear, be strong
And don't let this nightmare get to you
Cause some men gotta have two girls 
And that ain't cool, so

1 -    He won't hurt you again
    He's never gonna hurt you again
    Cuz you've got a friend in me
    He's won't hurt you again
    He's never gonna hurt you again
    All you've gotta do is believe me

Lock the doors, I'm on my way
Cause he has no right to put his hands on you
Girl it hurts me to see him play you for a fool
So pack your bags, come go with me
I'll be that sunshine in your life
There's no need to worry
It's gonna be alright
Cause he won't hurt you

Repeat 1

Don't worry 'bout it babe
Are you in love with someone who's gonna make you cry
Oh yeah
You should already know I wanna be the special one in your life
He won't hurt you

Repeat 1

[Spoken]
You know sometimes I think about you
And I wonder how could a beautiful woman
Be going through such a terrible thing
But I wanna let you know, I'm here for you
You don't have to worry 'bout a thing baby
I promise, I promise

Repeat 1 'till fade
