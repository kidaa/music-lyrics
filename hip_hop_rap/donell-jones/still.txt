[Intro]
Uh, what
What's goin' on
Yeah, uh, what
What's goin' on

Seemed like everything was cool 
Until you came home yesterday What's goin' on
And girl, you know I ain't nobody's fool
Yet you insist on treating me this way What's goin' on
And I can't believe after all that we've been through
You still think you can hide from me, yeah What's goin' on
See I know something's wrong with me and you
This ain't the way true love's suppose to be
Are you still feelin' me

Am I still the one you love
Why does it seem like something's changed
With you and me
Oh how I wish things were the way they used to be
I need to know if you still believe
Do you still believe in love

Is this really what you want
Is there somewhere else you'd rather be What's goin' on
Oh girl, why can't you just tell me the truth
Instead of playing all these games with me
Are you still feelin' me What's goin' on

Am I still the one you love
Why does it seem like something's changed
With you and me
Oh how I wish things were the way they used to be
I need to know if you still believe
Do you still believe in love

Am I still the one you love
Why does it seem like something's changed
With you and me
Oh how I wish things were the way they used to be
I need to know if you still believe
Do you still believe in love

What, uh, what 
What's goin' on 
Oh, oh, oh
Ummm, hmmm

Am I still the one you love
Why does it seem like something's changed
With you and me
Oh how I wish things were the way they used to be
I need to know if you still believe
Do you still believe in love

Am I still the one you love
Why does it seem like something's changed
With you and me
Oh how I wish things were the way they used to be
I need to know if you still believe
Do you still believe in love

Can we get back to the lovin'
Can we get back to the lovin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh
Umm, hmm
