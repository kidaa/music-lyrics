She was 14 and he was 24
Shorty claimed she never had sex before
He's driving Benz and got a lot of dough
He takes her to the movies and buys her Nike's yo
And makes sure she think that she got it all
Ain't even recognizing the signs of a booty call
Better listen to what I'm telling y'all got to show her what she's worth

It makes me wanna cry
Cause the shorty's being treated just like a woman
It makes me wanna cry
Cause her parents ain't even trying to confront him
It makes me wanna cry
Black people we need to show our children a little loving
It makes me wanna cry
Get back in the church read your Bibles get out the struggle
It makes me wanna cry ooh ooh

Momma's trickin' to feed the baby yo
Cause daddy took the money and put it up his nose
He hits the hustler up for some credit yo
But never took the time to go buy some baby clothes
She's so adorable but she's on her own
Three months old and they left her home alone
Fire brakes out the little baby burns
Tell me when will we learn?

It makes me wanna cry
Cause the baby didn't ask for all this trouble
It makes me wanna cry
Cause the parents didn't see this baby suffer
It makes me wanna cry
Black people we need to show our children a little loving
Makes me wanna cry
Get back in the church and read your Bibles get out the struggle
It makes me wanna cry

yo listen up
Cause I done been all around the world every city has a ghetto
It makes me wanna cry cry
Nothin' but abandoned buildings look at the way my people living
It makes me wanna cry cry
Done been to so many places don't see no smile up on they faces
It makes me wanna cry cry
You got to get it together so your life can be much better Oh Cry

Cry this is going out to all the little 'round the world
Don't it make you wanna cry?
Cause black people we need to, got to show our children some lovin'
Cry you got to get back in church and study the word cause you know it will stay
Cry you don't have to cry
you don't have to cry no more, don't cry
you don't have to cry no more, don't cry
you don't have to cry no more, don't cry
you don't have to cry no more, don't cry
