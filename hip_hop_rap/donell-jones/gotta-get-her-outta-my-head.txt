Gotta get her out of my head
I gotta get her out of my heart
But I don't know where to start
Every little thing you do
Just won't let me get over you

Gotta get her out of my head
Gotta get her out of my heart
But I don't know where to start
Every little thing you do
Won't let me get over you

I think back on all the love we shared
Ain't it sad to see it all disappeared
When I don't even know where we went wrong
But my heart beats strong 
And I know that you been away too long

But you know that I'm not the type of guy
To just sit around and let time pass me by
Got to get on out for a while
And just do my thing
But every time I get up
It seems I end up right back in love

Gotta get her out of my head
I gotta get her out of my heart
But I don't know where to start
Every little thing you do
Just won't let me get over you

I pretend that I'm not breaking down 
I tried to hide the hurt whenever you come around
But it's plain to see that I need your love 
So baby if you stayed another day
It wouldn't be too long

Everywhere I go at the end of every show
I press rewind to me and you 
And the things we used to do, and we did so much
I can't escape the memories of how we loved and lost 
And let our thoughts tear us apart

Gotta get her out of my head
I gotta get her out of my heart
But I don't know where to start
Every little thing you do
Just won't let me get over you
