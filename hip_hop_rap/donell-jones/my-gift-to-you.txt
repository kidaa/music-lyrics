Christmas is the time we have picked to give 
Each other gifts Oh yeah, yeah 
Most people never seem to think about the things 
We really need oh ho oh whoo 

So I'm offering this wrapped present 
Wrapped up in a package that you can get from someone 
Get from someone 
This package that they'll bring to you 
Is my gift to you 

We must not predict without giving up ourself you know 
It's just not a gift oh no huh 
So how can you expect a gift from someone else unless you give 
That's just the sign of a selfish man 

So I'm offering my heart and soul 
And every single part I have to give of myself 
To give of myself 
My love is what I bring to you 
Is my gift to you 

Oh yeah my gift, my gift, my gift to you 

So I'm offering this wrapped present 
Wrapped up in a package that you can get from someone oh yeah 
Get from someone 
This package that they'll bring to you 
Is my gift to you 

Said it's my gift yeah huh 
Gonna say it again 
My gift to you 
Yeah my gift to you 
Do you hear what I'm talking about baby 
My gift, my gift, my gift to you 
Oh yeah yeah 
My gift to you 
Said it's my gift 
Said it's my gift 
My gift to you
