Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Listen baby

Up in the place I see you getting down
Can't help but look at ya
Gotta crowd around you
Now you're the baddest thing I've seen tonight
So come on girl let's put it in flight
I got the V-1-2, 6-0-0
Sitting outside of the door
So bring it on, by the way
Your body's blazeful
And that's a little something a nigga craves for

1 -     It's a quarter past three
    Girl what's it gonna be
    Shorty got her eyes on me
    We've been talking since two
    Girl what'cha gonna do
    Tell him that you're riding with me

    It's a quarter past three
    Girl what's it gonna be
    Shorty got her eyes on me
    You've been fronting since two
    Girl what'cha gonna do
    I'll be chillin' at the Embassy, what?

I'm watching you move, I stop to fantasize
About the way I'm gonna put it on that ass tonight
So come on and ride shotgun
I got the bubbles if you like it we can pop some
I see me and you, flossing in my coupe
Maybe we can peel back to roof and get it on
Did I say your body's blazeful
I like the little thing around your navel, baby

Repeat 1

All I know is I'm not leaving here alone, yeah
Now you might be the baddest in the club to me
But shorty's got it bad and wanna slide with me tonight
So what'cha gonna do What'cha gonna do
Is it gonna be me and you
You gotta stop playing games
Girl, you gotta stop fakin' moves

Repeat 1 till end
