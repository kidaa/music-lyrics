And give you the moon and the stars above
Would you like if I can take you to ecstasy
Show you the love you truly need
So baby won't you, baby won't you

See I've waited for the moment to be with you
So forget all the things he put ya through
You should know I wanna take you from your misery
So you can be treated like a queen
And all you gotta do is

Repeat 1

Shhhhhhhh, just think about it
All I want to do is give my love to you
Love to you
Whenever you need me I'm gonna see ya through
See ya through
All I want to do is give my love to you
Love to you
Whenever you need me I'm gonna see ya through
See ya through
