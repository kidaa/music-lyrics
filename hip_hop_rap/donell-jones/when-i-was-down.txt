1 -     When I was down you wasn't there for me
    Pushed my love right out the door
    At this point, I can't take no more
    When I was down you wasn't there for me
    That's the reason I'm leaving you
    Girl, I'm through

My all and my everything
She couldn't do no wrong
Until the cash was gone
And she fronted like she cared for me
But what's the possiblity that she was gettin' me for my money

Repeat 1

No more lies baby, things done changed
I'm not the man I used to be
I gotta look out for me
And after all that we've been through
I can't believe that you would think that I could love you

Now things done changed
And my life just ain't the same
You've been trying to come back home to me
That ain't gonna happen, baby

Repeat 1 until fade
