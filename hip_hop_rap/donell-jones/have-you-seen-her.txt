Well, well, well, well, ooh whoa
Check it out

Sitting at the light she pulled up on my right
Looking in the mirror making sure her shit was tight
I know she felt me watching but was scared to look my way
I know she wants to look, but I think I've got her shook

Under pressure, don't know what to do
She's got two cuties with her and I got my peoples too
She put it in one, stepped on the gun and made a  U 
Looked inside, gave me a smile, then she blew
What am I gonna do?

1 -    Tell me which way did she go
    Pretty young thing in a GS4
    Love was so bangin' had me open from the door
    Tell me have you seen her

    She had a smile that I couldn't forget
    Shining brighter than the flawless piece around her neck
    The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
    Tell me have you seen her
    Have you seen her?

It's been awhile now and I'm steady on the case
Everyday I'm looking for her face
Is like a dream to me and I gotta make it real
Gotta let her know just how I feel

Now there she goes again driving by
I hit my horn, she throws her beams on high
I put my joint in gear and I tried to give chase
She disappears again without a trace
Tell me have you seen her?

Repeat 1

I gotta find her, where did you go, babe?
Listen girl you seem to think you got away from me
You got me looking for you in all these busy streets
I must admit I got it bad for you
It's just a little taste of all the things I'll do for you

Repeat 1 till end
