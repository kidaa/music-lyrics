To all the girls around the way what you wanna do
Cuz we bout to come through
Put your sundresses on forget the thongs and let's get our freak on
But first I wanna pop Cris with you, get high with you, lay down with you
But you gotta tell me what a nigga gotta do
Cuz I wanna know about that freak in you
Bring out that freak in you

To answer your question is D
Gotta know do you wanna roll with me
I rock from the East to the West Indies
Look at lil' shortie she's a real cutie
Chillin' at the bar got her eyes on me
Lookin' like she wanna get real freaky
She can get all this love for free
So I hit her off with a hotel key

Sex in the air, what you wanna do, it won't stop til the night is through
Gotta see that freak in you

Would you hold the keys whip, but only if you're freakin' it
If it's good, I'll take you to the crib
