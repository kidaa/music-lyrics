Verse 1
I want you to know
You're the best thing that came into my life
You make me feel so right
You've opened my eyes
A new world for me to see what we could be
I don't wanna be lonely
Baby, you know, yeah...
I would give anything just to be with you
Sacrificed my life to make your dreams com true
You gave my heart a brand new start we'll never part
I wann be where you are

Chorus
I want you to know
That I could give you love
I want you to know
That I am promising you the world
I want you to know
That I love you so
No one can take your love away from me

Verse 2
I want you to see
I can be all the man you'll ever need
I think of you only
Your future with me
It's a love that grows too far beyond a dream
I don't wanna be lonely
Baby, you know, yeah...
I would give anything just to be with you
Sacrifice my life to make your dreams come true
You gave my heart a brand new start we'll never part
I wanna be where you are

Chorus*

Bridge
I can promise you, baby
To save this real love you're giving me
I could never ever do you wrong
Oh, no, oh, no, no...
Oh, yeah, yeah...

Chorus/Vamp Out
