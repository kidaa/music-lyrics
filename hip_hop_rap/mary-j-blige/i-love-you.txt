Ohhhhh

Chorus
All those pretty memories, 
I know you can hear me now 
For the record, 
I love you, I love you 
Repeat

Vs.1
When I found out that you were leaving me, 
I couldn't sleep thinking about 
All the things that we've been through 
Now all that I want to do 
Is tell you that I, I 
Miss you...so much... 
You know I really really miss you... 

Chorus

Vs.2
Now that I'm on my own 
I know that in time I'll find somebody new 
Who'll treat me better than you 
So I'll go all alone without you 
But I still love you 
You know I'll never live without you 

Chorus

I wish you'd change your ways soon enough 
So we can be together 
You just don't understand good enough 
But now all we have is memories... 

Chorus
Memories we shared 
No one else could compare 
Ohh, I miss you, I miss you 
Oh I miss you 

...of the way we used to be, 
Oh, those pretty memories 

Oh.......
I miss you... 
I miss you... 
Oh, I miss you... 
Ohh...
