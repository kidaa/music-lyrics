Vs.1
You're my morning star 
Shining brightly beside me 
And if we keep this love 
It would last through all eternity 

Just the way we are 
A love story 
It's just the way it should be 

Chorus #1 
Cause our love 
Will stand tall as the trees 
Our love 
Will spread wide as the sea 
Our love 
Will shine bright in the night 
Like the stars above 
And we'll always be together 
Our love 

Vs.2
My love is surely one thing 
You can surely depend on 
In times of darkness and fear 
I go to you, 
I know you'll make me strong 

You're gonna make me happy 
You're gonna make me smile 

Chorus #2 
Our love 
will stand tall as the trees 
Our love 
Will be for the whole world to see 
Our love 
will change people's wrongs to rights 
And will never die 
Cause we will always have each other 

Chorus #1 

Break it down 
Just a little 
Because love is soft, love is sweet 
Love is nice, love is gentle 
Love is joy, love is pain 
Love is light when you're in the rain 
I got love on my mind 
Love is always right on time 
Love is you, love is me 
Love is just a little baby 
Our love I got love on my mind 
Love is always right on time time 
Love is you, love is me 
Love is gonna set you free 
Our love
