feat. Jadakiss

[1] - Can't have you if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can have you if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

[Repeat 1]

Looking in my mirror
Thinking 'bout last night
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

[Repeat 1]

You were saying, Mary
Don't let go, hold tight
I just wanna hold you
All through the night

[2] - This is something that I can't deny
Boy you know your touch just drives me wild
Won't you take my hand, I'll set you free
I want you to belong to me

[Repeat 1]

Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh

[Jadakiss]
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Yo, yo, yo
You might bump into the 'Kiss late night
On the Deegan, speeding
In the drop four-thirty, on my way to rock a birdie
With automatic lead in the car, bread in the car
Plus I'm gettin' head in the car
My wedding tomorrow
More dutchies to the head, the redder you are
After the session with shorty
I'll be better tomorrow
And you know how we are
We always keep more than two
That don't say much
Like to hit a blunt or two
Or don't mind driving with raw in the trunk
Or freaking off for the week
Top flow in the trunk
Just laying back blowing
Twenty five's a skull
The Akitas by the door with bow ties and puffs
Can't let me get away
But you ain't ready for 'Kiss
Got the Chevy and the Six
Wrists heavy and shit
Matter of fact we gonna take a trip
And put the daps up
And cop the pink lemonade Cadillac truck

[Repeat 1 2x]

[Repeat 2]

Can't have you if I wanted to
Can't have you
Can't let you go, no
Can't have you if I wanted to
Can't have you
Can't let you go, no

[Repeat 1 till end]
