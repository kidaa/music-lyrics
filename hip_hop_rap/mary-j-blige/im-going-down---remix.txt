Vs.1
Remember all the days when loving you was easy 
You used to hold and squeeze me all through the night 
I wanna make you feel like you never felt in your life 
Just wanna make it alright 
So hold on tight 

Baby I'm going down 
'Cause you're never around 
And I'm feeling like I can't let go 
Please stay with me 
Baby, please stay with me 

Deep inside I'm slowly dying 
And through all my screams and crying 
I am holding on with all my might 
Why can't you see... 

Chorus
I'm going down 
I'm going down 
I'm going down 
I'm going down 

Vs.2
Please tell me why you feel this way inside 
I realy need to know so I can ease my mind 
I wanna make you see that I'm everything you need 
Your every wish, your dream come true, your fantasy 

Baby I'm going down 
'Cause you're never around 
And I'm feeling like I can't let go 
Please stay with me 
Baby, please say with me 

Deep inside I'm slowly dying 
And through all my screams and crying 
I am holding on with all my might 
Why can't you see... 

Chorus

Don't know what's happenin' to me 
I'm feelin' realy crazy 
Is it because I'm goin' down? 

Sometimes I still don't know why 
I sit around and I cry 
It's all because I'm going down 

Chorus and adlib until fade
