Uh, uh-huh
Yeah somebody always walking out
Whether it be me or you
But before you go let me lay it on you
Say they call me a Capricorn
And that mean that no man in the world
Can let go of this Capricorn
See you know why
I got something for your mind, your body
Your soul, your intellect
Whatever you choose
Check me out

I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door
Remember the good times, don't you want some more
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it
Cause I believe that's what God intended now

We got love too good to throw away
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free, oh
What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder
Oh can't throw it away
Can't throw it away, no, no, no, no

I can hear those words spoken, understood
Making bonds through love, if times are bad or good
I'm convinced that what is meant to be will be
Even the stars declare that you belong to me

And we got love too good to throw away
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free, and
What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder
Oh can't throw it away
Can't throw it away, can't throw it away, no

Hmmm
It's not over between you and me
Oh it's not over
It's not over, don't want to be free
It's not over between you and me
It's not over
It's not over, don't want to be free
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free
It's not over between you and me
Hey
It's not over, don't want to be free

Oh, hmm-hmm, oh
See I just been trying to tell you that
It's not over
All that listening to your friends you're doing
They laughing at you right now
Yes they are, yes they are
It's not over
But you still wanna walk out
Why you wanna leave me right now
All you wanna do is scream and shout
All night long, all night long
It's not over
But I still think it ain't over
Cause you'll be calling back

We got love too good to throw away
Let no man put asunder
We got love too good to throw away
Let no man put asunder
