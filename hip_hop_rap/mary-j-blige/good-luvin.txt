Mary: 
There's no need for you to be afraid 
Of me, oh no 
I'll be there to comfort you 
'Cause in me you have found a home 

All you got to do is believe baby 
And trust in me 
All my needs I will suffice 
Give you such a perfect life 

Don't Go 
Let me touch you baby 
I can 
I'll make you feel alright 
You really got it going on 
Your love is 
Good down to the bone 
Oh the way the way you love me is incredible 
Your loving must be heaven sent. Heaven sent 

Chorus: 
You give good luvin' 
To me 
You give good luvin' 
To me 

Christopher:
Put your every need first 
Tonight, you dream no more 
I'll make your every wish come true 
Deep inside my heart __________ 

Relax your mind 
And let me touch your soul 
Caress you tenderly 
Until you loose control, all control 

Don't Go 
Let me touch you baby 
I can 
I'll make you feel alright 
You really got it going on 
Your love is 
Good down to the bone 
Oh the way the way you love me is incredible 
Your love must be heaven sent. Heaven sent
