[Intro - Spoken]
You know sometimes
There come a time in your life
When you love something
You have to let it go
And even though
You might feel there's still something there
You have to wake up
Stop living in a dream
Cause it's over now
You got to think about you

I have always wondered why
Why I can't live without you babe
And I'm longing to be your lady
I understand that you are leaving
Please don't leave here without me, babe
Cause I think I might go insane

[1] - Cause everybody needs someone to love
And I know that it's true
And I know that it's you
I don't understand
Why you can't be my man
So I've gotta wake up
Stop living in a dream
Yes I've gotta wake up
Cause I can't lose the love I never had
Yeah I've gotta wake up
As painful as it seems
Yes I better wake up
I can not lose a love I never had

Every time I close my eyes
I see visions of you and I
Sharing love of a special kind, oh
I got to laugh to keep from crying, yeah
To hide all the pain inside
Cause I can't get you off my mind

[Repeat 1]

Oh, it made me realize
Honey, I don't wanna live a lie
But you don't know how hard I try
What do I have to lose
Oh I think a little bit more than you
And I doubt you will see things
Clearer than me, before it's too late

[Repeat 1]

Oh, ya hurt me so bad
I I I got to wake up
Break it down, break it down

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
All the times I've cried
It made me realize
That I was only living a lie
But you don't know how hard I tried
To make sure you were satisfied yeah
Cause I thought you were only mine
And I doubt if you will see things clearly
Before it's too late, too late, too late
I don't understand why you can't be my man
Oh everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody yeah
Oh, do do do
Baby, baby, baby I can't live without you
And I doubt that you will see things clearly
Before it's too late, yeah
Oh you hurt me so, you hurt me so
La la la, la la la
I can't lose, I can't lose
I can not lose, I can not lose
Oh oh oh
I can't lose a love I never had
Oh yeah yeah
