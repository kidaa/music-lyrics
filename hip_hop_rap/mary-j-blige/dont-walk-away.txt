Oh:

[1] - Don't you walk, away from me
Cause I don't want to see you leave

[Repeat 1]

Tell me what
What is better than sharing
Sharing love with you
And tell what
What is better than caring
I want to spend my life with you

[Repeat 1 2x]

Oh do you know
Do you know how I'm feeling
When you're lying next to me
And does it show
Everything that I'm feeling
When you touch me it's real
Don't walk:

[Repeat 1 4x]

When we share
Our love I feel
Like it is so real
Please tell me the deal
I can make you see
What is extasy
Come and go with me
But don't walk away

Oh ooh
I don't wanna see you
Oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna see you

[Repeat 1 4x]

See I'm serious baby
But now it's a little off
But you can't walk away
Know what I'm saying
Cause you can't never lose the love that you never had
And if the nigga never did love you
Then you ain't lost nothing
First of all, but if I love somebody
Please don't walk away
