Everyday

Chorus
Everyday it rains 
Everyday it rains 'cause things will never be the same 
Everyday it rains 
Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame 

How can I try to make you understand that I'm 
Only living a lie 
'Cause I have to walk around everyday 
With a smile 
Everyday

Chorus

Waking every morning knowing you're not there 
Is the only thing that gets me scared 
All I do is think of you and all the love we shared 
Everyday

It keeps on rainin in my life 
It rains 
And every day's the same 
Baby you brightened up my life 
So realize 

Everyday it rains yeah 
Things will never be the same 
I am not the one to blame 
Just because it rains everyday oh 

I'm not the one to blame 

Believe me when I say that it rains everyday 
Got a cloud over me all the time and I 
Don't know why it rains 
It rains and rains 

Chorus

Waking every morning knowing you're not there 
Is the only thing that gets me scared 
I don't know when you're comin home 
But I'll be waiting with open arms 
Believe me when it rains 
It rains for real
