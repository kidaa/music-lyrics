I've never been touched like this- I've never been
I've never been kissed like this- I've never been
I never knew it felt like this- I never knew
I never knew a love like this

Pardon me- excuse me- forgive me- I can't help it
But I see- the energy- 'tween you and me- and I'm selfish
Don't want no- other girls- calling you- never ever
Cause I want- us to stay- together- forever

I've never been touched like this- I've never been
I've never been kissed like this- I've never been
I never knew it felt like this- I never knew
I never knew a love like this

Believe me- when I say- there is no one- I mean none
That can do- the things you do- the things you did- and get done
And I believe- that I can feel- this way- for a reason
In all the ways- you make me feel- boy you keep- me breathing

I've never been touched like this- I've never been
I've never been kissed like this- I've never been
I never knew it felt like this- I never knew
I never knew a love like this

What you got- Them others don't- Cause you're the one I want
You make me hot- Them others don't- Cause baby you're the one I love
What you got- Them others don't- Cause you're the one I want
You make me hot- Them others don't- Cause baby you're the one I love

I've never been touched like this- I've never been
I've never been kissed like this- I've never been
I never knew it felt like this- I never knew
I never knew a love like this

I've never been touched like this- I've never been
I've never been kissed like this- I've never been
I never knew it felt like this- I never knew
I never knew a love like this
