Chorus
You abandoned me 
Love don't live here anymore 
Just a vacancy 
Love don't live here anymore 

Faith: 
When you lived inside of me 
There was nothing I could conceive 
That you wouldn't do for me 
Trusting so far away 
You changed that right away 

Chorus

Mary: 
Love don't live here anymore 
Just emptiness and memories of what we had before 
You went away 
Found another place to stay 
Another home 

Chorus 

Faith: 
Through the windows of my eyes 
Everyone can see 
The loneliness inside of me 
Why you had to go away 
Don't you know I miss you so 
I need your love 

Chorus x2 

Love don't live here 
Love don't live here anymore x4 

Adlib until Fade
