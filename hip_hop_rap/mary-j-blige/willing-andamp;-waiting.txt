Willing & waiting
But it's all up to you, ohhh

The very first time I laid my eyes on you
I knew you were the one
Nothing can compare to all the times
We both had some fun
Sometimes I wanna cry
Cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands
I want him for my man
Waiting for you

I-I-I'm willing & waiting
So in love with you so in love with you
Willing & waiting
Boy it's on you it's on you
Willing & waiting
Boy I need the truth boy I need the truth
Willing & waiting
So in love with you

Every time boy I take one look at you
I see the sun just shine
When we're alone never want the night to end
Cause you're the one I want
Sometimes I wanna cry
Cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands
I want him for my man
Waiting for you

Willing & waiting
So in love with you so in love with you
Willing & waiting
Boy it's on you on you
Willing & waiting
Boy I need the truth boy I need the truth
Willing & waiting
So in love with you

You better answer oh yes you better answer
You better answer

Sometimes I wanna cry
Cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands
I want him for my man
Waiting for you

[Chorus 3X till fade]
