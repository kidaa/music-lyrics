So beautiful, you are, yeah 
Soooooooo
Yes, you are 
You're so... 

Chorus
Beautiful
Now you're near 
In my life 
Oh my dear 

Beautiful
Come to me 
Now I have- 
Someone watching over me 

Vs.1
All my days and nights so lonely 
'Til you came into my life 
You came and brought my life back to me 
Cause I was dying deep inside 

You brought the light 
And my life was so dark 
You took the fight 
And you made it your own 
I really love you 
No other love can measure up 
To the love that you give to me 
And with all this love comes trust 

You're so... 

Chorus

Vs.2
I opened up my arms to greet you 
With unconditional love 
Tender sweet is he that helps me 
Leave my problems all behind 

Baby come to me 
Baby come to me. You know that I will set you free 
Promise it will be 
Promise it will be an experience for you and me 
Something beautiful 
Let me take you to a place where there is understanding 
Where love flows unselfishly and never ever demanding 

So beautiful... 
So beautiful 
...Since you came into my life
