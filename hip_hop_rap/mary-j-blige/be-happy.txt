Vs.1
How can I love somebody else 
If I can't love myself enough to know 
When it's time, 
Time to let go 
Sing

Chorus
All I really want 
is to be happy 
And to find a love that's mine 
It would be so sweet 
Repeat

Vs.2
I ask for the sign 
From the sweet Lord above 
I know the answer is in front of me 
But when you think you're in love 
You only see what you wanna see 
And all I see is me for you 
And you for me 

Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside 
No I don't know why 
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry 
Every day I wanna cry 
If I give you one more try 
To there rules, will you abide 
And if I mean anything to you 
Would it make everything all right 

Chorus

I just wanna be so, so, happy 
But the answer lies in me 
I do believe 
That we can be happy 
I said I wanna be happy, yeah 

Vs.3
Life is too short 
To be tryin to play some games 
Now take some time and think about 
If it's really worth losing me 
Why must it be this way 
Why do you have to play with my mind 
All the time 
Help me sing it 

All I really want is for me to be happy 
Ohhh, just help me sing it 
All I really want is for me to be happy 
Yeahhhhhhh
All I really want is for me to be happy 
Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah 
~repeat through chorus~ 

I don't wanna have to worry about nothin no more 
Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be 
Chorus
