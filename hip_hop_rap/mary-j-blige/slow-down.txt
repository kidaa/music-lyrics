Slow down baby. The lovin' ain't goin' nowhere. 

Chorus
Don't rush baby. The lovin' ain't goin' nowhere 
Slow down 
Don't rush baby. The lovin' ain't goin' nowhere 
Slow down 

Vs.1
When we make love 
Baby all we got to do is take our time 
and get it, get it right in the groove 

Now there's no need for us to be 
in a rush so slow it down 
Slow it down and get it right. 

Now baby it's understood 
When the lovin' is feeling good 
So let's just take our time and make it last 

Chorus

Vs.2
Now I got a feelin' baby 
That tonight could be the night 
Don't rush it. Don't fight it. 

If you got a notion 
Baby please let it be slow motion 
Slow it down baby. Keep it right there. Keep it right there. 

Now baby it's understood 
When the lovin' is feelin good 
so let's just take our time and make it last 

Chorus
