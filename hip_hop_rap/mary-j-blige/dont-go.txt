[1st Verse:]
Everyday is not a perfect day for you and I somedays.
Somedays things are just not right.
That doesn't mean that
I don't love you.
And boy you know its true.
I can't not always please you.
When I look intro your eyes.
When I look into your eyes.
I always see myself.
That means that we are one.
No one else can satisfy this girl the way you do.
I know that love makes all the rules.

[B-Sect:]
Sometimes I say things to hurt you.
And I'll apologize.
Neither one of us are perfect.
So you should realize.

[Chorus:]
Don't go baby.
Baby don't you go.
Don't go baby.
I still love you so.

[2nd Verse:]
Don't act that way if I ask you to stay.
Please don't walk away from me baby.
Give me the same respect that you
want from me.
Why don't you?.
Cause Lord knows that I deserves it too.

[B-Sect:]
Sometimes I say things to hurt you.
And I'll apologize.
Neither one us of are perfect.
So you should realize.

[Chorus:]
Don't go baby.
Baby don't you go.
Don't go baby.
I still love you so.
Don't go baby.
Baby don't you go.
Don't go baby.
I still love you so.

[Bridge:]
We always gon make mistakes.
Sometimes were not always gonna get along.
Were not always gonna get along but I....
So stop wasting all your time thinking that I don't love you.
Cause if love makes all the rules no one is played for...

[Repeat Chorus until song fades]
