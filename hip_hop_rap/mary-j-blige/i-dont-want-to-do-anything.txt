Chorus
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I don't want to do anything else 
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I don't want to do anything else 

Vs.1 [K-ci] 
Listen baby 

Every night and day 
I dream of another way 
to tell you something good 
I don't think that I'm understood 
You walk away and I frown 
With my head hung far down 
You tell me what is wrong 
You just wanna be loved all night long baby 

Chorus

Vs.2 [Mary J. Blige] 

You told me a thousand times 
That you would be mine, all mine 
I do everything for you 
But in your smile, I still can't find 
And now you tell me this 
This is something that I can miss 
And all you wanna do is to love me for me 
And I'll love you for you 

Chorus

Bridge

[K-ci]
Now that I know I'm gonna make love to you 
So lady open up your heart 
And let me in where I belong 

[Mary]
If loving you is all that I have to do 
Then it won't be wrong baby 
Mary   K-ci Cause we belong together baby

[K-ci]
They can take my possessions
No, no, no, no, They can never take your love away from me 

[Mary]
Oh, see now listen, with every breath I breath 
And every beat in my heart 
I know that no one, I know that no one 
Can tear us apart 
Oh no 
Cause I love you baby 
K I love you too 
And I need you baby 
K I need you to baby 

[K-ci] Mary in background Ad-libing 
Stay with me more than just a day 
And you know, you know, you know 

I love you 
Oh yes 
Oh you make me feel so good baby
