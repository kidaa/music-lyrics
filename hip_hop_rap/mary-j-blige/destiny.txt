People tell me my life was predestined 
From my life others shall learn a lesson 
Born a leader with the world on my shoulder 
Age is young but my mind is much older 
Living up to everyone's expectation 
Condemned me to a world of damnation 

I gotta clear these voices from my head 
All these opinionated noises 
Listen to the voice of my creator 
Opens door to a path much greater 
On this path the days draw nearer 
When I can be happy, finally happy yeah 

1 -	Searching for my destiny 
	I'll search for what makes me happy 
	??? what others thought of me 
	I gotta be happy, finally happy 

	Searching for my destiny 
	I'll search for what makes me happy 
	??? what others thought of me 
	I gotta be happy, finally happy 

Time to broaden my horizons 
Come out from the dark and opened up my eyes and 
Started to define my destiny 
Experience what life can really be 
No longer concerned with your opinion 
Over my life I have dominion 
I'm stronger now than before 
I'm sure I can be so much more 
Not what you thought I would be 
Cuz I'm gonna be happy yeah 
I'm gonna be happy 
Finally you see, oh 

Repeat 1 until fade
