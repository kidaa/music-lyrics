Intro:
Yeah, ohh yeah, this one goes out, 
to all the families that went through the struggle, 
yeah, from the heart, it was from the heart, everything was real 

yo, dwelling in the past, flash back when I was young 
who ever thought that I would have a beby girl and 3 sons 
I'm going through this difficult stage I find it hard 
to believe why my old earth had so many seeds 
but she's an old woman and do to me I respect that 
I saw life for what its really worth and took a step back 
family ain't family no more, we used to play ball 
eggs after school, eat gritz cause we were poor 
grab the plyers for the channel, fix the hanger on the T.V. 
rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy 
we survived winters snauty nose with no coats 
we kept it real but the older brother still had a joke 
sadly daddy left me at the age of six 
I didn't know nutin' but mommy neatly packed his shit 
she cried, and grandma held the family down 
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went straight down 
check it, 15 of us in a three bedroom apartment 
roaches everywhere causons and aunts were there. 
4 in the bed, 2 at the foot, 2 at the head 
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon, he peed the bed 
pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
we shared the epoon, watchin saturday cartoons 
sugar water was our thing, everymeal was no thrill 
in the summer school lunch held us down like steel 
and there was days I had to go to Shea's house with a note 
"Shea and Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke" 
so embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on the door 
my friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores 
mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper 
look Ms. Rose bought us a couch, shes the neighbor 
2 brothers who must led this defeat kiiled me 
but I remember this mom's would lick her finger tips 
to wipe the cold out of my eye before school wit her spit 
case worker had her runnin back for face to face 
I caught a case worker, trying to throw us out our place. 
sometimes I'm lookin back and analyze the sky, 
goodnight

outro
sometime I'm lookin back and analyze the sky 
let myself rock wasn't meant to be so hard 

Mary J. Blige: Chorus 
All that I got is you 
And I'm so thankful I made it through 
3x

I sit and think about all the times we did without rain 
I always said I woudn't cry, when I saw tears in your eyes 
I understand that daddy's not here know, 
but some way or some how, I will always be around 
All the things that I did from yesterday 
oh from drugs to being bad 
being down and out and I love you always, oh oh
