Chorus
A dream 
A simple fantasy 
That I wish was reality 
That you come knocking at my door 
And we relive this dream once more 

Vs.1
Last night I dreamed 
That you were here with me 
And we were in each other's arms 
It was oh so heavenly 
You held me close to you 
And whispered in my ear 
Let's spend the night together 
Sharing love beyond the bed 

As we danced to the melody 
We had so much to share 
And the music stopped 
In a flash I was all alone 
It was just a dream 
Haunting me once again 

Chorus

Vs.2
The day you left 
You said you would return 
Just when you couldn't promise 
That you needed some time alone 
You said you'd love me 
And someday our love would be 
I couldn't understand it 
I thought we were both happy 

As we danced to the melody 
We had so much to share 
Then the music stopped 
In a flash I was all alone 
It was just a dream 
Haunting me once again, oh a dream 

Repeat chorus until fade.
