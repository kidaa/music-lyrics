Vs.1
Many have called but the chosen are few 
The best of the few is you 
You know exactly what to do 

Baby, your time is so perfect 
Why in the hell I deserve it 
Keep on doin' what you do 

Chorus
No one else 
No one else 
Can do me like you do me 

No one else 
No, no one else 
Can do me like you do me 

Vs.2
Happy 1 plus happy 1 is 2 
Happy 2 is me and you 
Our love was meant to be 

Yes, we have our up's and down's 
But some how we came around 
And we made each other love so free 

Bridge:
Can't lie 
Now I'm satisfied 
Yes I'm satisfied 
Even when I cry 

Won't stray 
Stray away from you 
I would be a fool 
You know these words are true 

Chorus

Repeat bridge 

Chorus and adlib until fade
