You came home late last night you smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself this man has no respect for me
I knew it all along cause you were talking in your sleep

It's a wrap 
Why you go and do me like that 
I thought the love was good 
But I misunderstood baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

Heard you calling her name
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do 
Cause I'm through with you 
I heard you calling her name
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do 
Cause I'm through with you
I heard you

What you were saying in your sleep it violated me
No doubt about it but there's nothing left for you and me
Because you're busted and I might as well go on
Boy it's gonna take a long time to make this a happy home

You know it's a wrap 
Why you go and do me like that 
I thought the love was good 
But I misunderstood baby
It's a wrap 
And I am not surprised 
How you could sit right here 
And look me in my eyes
And tell a lie

I heard you
Heard you calling her name 
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do
Cause I'm through with you 
I heard you calling her name 
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do 
Cause I'm through with you

All you had to say was I don't wanna be with you
Why don't you tell the truth cause I already got the proof
It will never be the same you know it's a crying shame
Cause now I am disgusted cause you are so cold busted
I heard you calling her name
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do 
Cause I'm through with you 
I heard you calling her name
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do 
Cause I'm through with you
Heard you calling her name 
In your sleep at night 
What are we gonna do 
Cause I'm through with you 
I heard you 

Why you go and do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood baby
It's a wrap 
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie
