[50 Cent singing]

MJ, 50 Cent. G UUUNIT!
This is simple. I know  you understand.
Another man can't quite love you girl.
Like I can. Your fantasies and your dreams.
Believe in me. I will fufill. Now you know how I feel.
Now baby tell me how do you feel?

[Mary J. Blige]

[Verse 1]

Boy I feel like this just can't be real. 
And if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up.
So what's the deal? Should I save my love for you?
Cause no way makes me feel the way that you do.

You make me wanna see your face everyday. Mmm... Hmmm...
Deep down inside I know that your my soul mate. You are my soul mate.
If you should be my man. Patiently. Patiently. Cause boy I know that your the one for me.

[Hook]

Let me be the  one to give you everything. Boy I wanna be the one.
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams. Always be in your dreams.
Let me be the one who'd be right by your side. I'll be there, I'll be there.
Let me be the one, Let me be the one, let me be the one.
Let me be the one...

[Mary J. Blige]

[Verse 2]

I'm your girl. See there's no one quite like me. No one will love you that I do.
I get chiils. When you put your arm around me. You make me feel like I'm the only one.

You make me wanna see your face everyday. 
Deep down inside I know that your my soul mate. You are my soul mate.
If you should be my man. Patiently. I'll be right here waiting. 
Cause boy I know that your the one for me. Your the one... your the one.

[Repeat Hook 2x]

[Bridge]

Why won't you let me be? Why won't you let me be?. 
The one to set you free. I wanna set you free.
I'll give you what you need. I'll give you what you need.
If you would just let me be the onnnnnneee!

[Repeat Hook]

[50 Cent Verse]

Baby if ever you need someone who knows you.
Someone to go to. Someone to be by your side.
Baby if ever you need someone to talk too.
Someone to hold you. Someone to be down to ride.
You can count on me. I'll be there for ya. When you need me I care for you.
Like you care for me. Please believe me! If I was locked up I know you'd be the one to come see me.
Cause you understand life were we from ain't easy. Problems. They say when it rains it pours. 
But I'm sure.
Together we can weather the storm. Your friends they don't understand the shit we on. 
When I'm gone I'm missing you. Your love is unconditional. Your my heart.
I NEED YOU TO LIVE!!!
Picture me dissin you. 
Now pictrue something positive.
Me hugging and kissing you.
If ever you doubt how I feel this is what you should listen too.

[Ad-Libs]

Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you...
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you...
