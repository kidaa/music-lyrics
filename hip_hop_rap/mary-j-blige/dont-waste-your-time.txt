feat. Aretha Franklin

[Mary]
Lately I've got this funny feeling
Something don't feel the same
But he's telling me I'm the one to blame
Yes I know that he still gives me good loving
But when he's deep inside
There's somebody else on his mind

[1] - [Aretha] Don't waste your time
[Mary] But it gets so hard to know
[Aretha] Just walk away
[Mary] You say that I gotta let go
[Both] Seen it a millions times before
[Aretha] You shouldn't take his stuff no more
[Mary] Can't waste my time
[Aretha] Girl, it's not hard to know
[Mary] Should walk away
[Aretha] Oh, you've gotta let him go
[Both] Seen it a millions times before
[Mary] Shouldn't take his ish no more

[Aretha]
Sister girl, sister girl
It's much deeper than what you're thinking
When something don't feel the same
Hey you better believe his love has change
And I have been telling you, telling you
And what you're telling me
Cuz it's been hurting me, hurting me
It ain't, ain't any fool can see
He's got a sweetie on the side
Stop making truth out of his lies

[Repeat 1]

[Aretha & Mary]
What's the point of love
When you got no trust
What's the point of staying
When you seen enough
What's the point of giving
What he don't deserve

[Mary]
He don't deserve it
No you don't deserve it

[Aretha]
Oh what's the point of feeling

[Aretha & Mary]
Like there's nothing inside
What's the point of saying
That you still got your pride
What's the point of giving
What he don't deserve
This is a lesson of love
