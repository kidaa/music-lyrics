Sitting here all alone on Valentine's Day
I really wanna call him up
But my pride is all in the way, hey
Picture's getting clearer
I see what's been going wrong for years
The ones you say are far, really are so near
I'm thinking of

[1] - Roses that you sent to me
All the kisses that you gave to me
Memories of what we used to be
All alone this special day
Thinking 'bout the time you went away
Valentine's Day will never be the same

How come men nowadays bring you so much joy
And so much pain
Can anybody help me
I think I'm going insane
Valentine's Day will never be the same
Cause I think about you always
I cherish everything you gave to me
I'm thinking of

[Repeat 1]

You took my love for granted
Then you mean to think that 
Everything was fine between me and you
Everytime this day comes around
I wanna feel your touch
I can't believe what you did to me
I hate cha, did me wrong 
But still I must move on

I gotta move on, ooh oh

[Repeat 1 until fade]
