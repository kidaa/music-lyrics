In the meantime, what do you do 
When there's no one left but you 
And you're alone 
How do you feel when the one you love 
Doesn't, doesn't seem real 
Do you run, or do you try to heal 
The hurt inside 
But oh, but in the meantime 

1 - 	I have found within myself 
	Everything I need to get by 
	Cuz I 
	Know what to do in the meantime 
	Continue to love you 

There is no need for you to fear 
For I am here, I'll be right here 
All of your life 
And I am willing and able to pull you 
Pull you through, through the storm 
That might await you on the outside 
And all of your fears and your doubts will no longer exist 
Because God has granted you the greatest wage 
And He's done the same for me 
Cuz right now, you're all I need 

Repeat 1 

In the meantime what do you do 
When there is no one, love but you 
And you're alone, oh But in the meantime 
In the meantime, oh But in the meantime 
What do you do in the meantime But in the meantime 
There is no need for you to have no fear But in the meantime 
For I am here But in the meantime 
But in the meantime But in the meantime 
But in the meantime But in the meantime 
Oh I'm willing and I'm able But in the meantime 
To pull you through the storm 
Pull you through the storm But in the meantime 
In the mean But in the meantime 
Yeah
