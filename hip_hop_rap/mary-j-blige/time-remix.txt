feat. Q.S.R. Quasar

[Q.S.R.]
Quasar, and MJB's crazy, Loco 
It's 2-0-0-0 
Even they don't know
It don't show
Women they wanna grind in my path
Find a fo' do'
It's only a ninety three
Still they be Where
Behind the meat Yo 
I needed two points to swing Then I
Shot a three, got nigga's hot at me Word
But they can't do nada, B Uh uh
I'm more economy than the brand new odessey

Hey yo, Carter got it beat, these times and probably
Won't be around for nigga's to finish playing Monopoly
Yo, it's the dolla's B, that got me writin' apologies
The bill collectors, plead the fifth or cop a plea
When they follow me, I'm duckin' like somebody shot at me

[MJB Q.S.R.]
If I had my way I'd hit the highway
Life would be just fine Party on Friday
But the world's too much It's too much, too much
And it makes me cry Feel like I had enough
Sometimes I feel like leaving I'm on my way
But I must be wise Think twice
Because time Come on, sing it wit' me now
Is not on our side
Don't you know that time's not on our side
Because time is not on our side

[MJB]
The end is coming, stop your running
I'm telling you this is the truth
You can talk about what you read about
Everything is on the news
People nowadays so shady
Now what is wrong with them
Something cast a spell up on their minds
And they always wanna condemn

[MJB Q.S.R.]
If I had my way Uh huh
Life would be just fine Life would be fine
But the world's too much Too much, too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving It's gotta be gone
But I must be wise Mary Jane cries
Because time Come on, sing it wit' me now
Is not on our side 
Don't you know that time is not on our side
Because time is not on our side

[MJB]
While you're judging me, you should look around
And you'll see how people goin' down
Some of them are killed over a dime
Now tell me do we really have time
To continue with this madness
Cuz I'm sick and tired of it
Trying to crush my world with jealousy
And I'm about to catch a fit

[MJB Q.S.R.]
If I had my way I'd hit the highway
Life would be just fine Party on Friday
But the world's too much It's too much, too much
And it makes me cry Feel like I had enough
Sometimes I feel like leaving I'm on my way
But I must be wise Yo, think twice
Because time Sing it wit' me now
Is not on our side Uh huh, yup yup
Don't you know that time's not on our side
Because time Yo, time is running out
Is not on our side On our side

You're deceiving You can tell lies
What's the meaning Then they can falsefy
If you're retrieving You're ready for the don
The enemy's greeting You know it, ya'all can die
You all are leaving Whut someday but Whut
They don't know how Whut we are going Uh uh
Please believe me Whut when I tell you Whut
That time is Whut not really on our side

[Q.S.R.]
Yo, yo, aight
We gon' talk about life for a minute
How many nigga's out here do dirt but won't admit it, huh
How many nigga's know shorty young, but still hit it
Same nigga's that'll snatch your chains off and run wit' it
Yellin' Mary J, more cash than Mary K.
It rains every day, rock jewels the heavy way
Shorty's wanna talk to the guard, but anyways
All the stress that I got in my life, that make me say

[MJB]
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world's too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving 
But I must be wise 
Because time 
Is not on our side 
Don't you know that time is not on our side
Because time is not on our side

Repeat above while:
How can you hurt the children
They mean so much to us
They'll soon be leaders
And they will lead us to the rightous path
But you must understand
