Vs.1- Grand Puba 
Well, I be Puba on this here 
The nigga from last year 
Girbaud's hanging baggy 
Tommy Hilfiger top gear 
Take no shorts 
I'm doin lovely in all sports 
Even swing the pole at the hole on my golf course 
Some say I'm fancy 
Cause I'm horny and nasty 
If I see some rugged joint 
Then I won't let it pass me 
I take no shorts 
let suckas step up and see 
I'll flip the script and get harder than Jepoardy
I shot the sherif and the muthafuckin deputy 
Test me 
Check it 
I'm not Keith Sweat but bet that ass 
That I can make it last 
Skinz turn they head so fast 
They end up catching whip lash 
If hun's a monster 
I'm Carl Lewis on a meter dash 
It's Grand Puba baby 
And I'm gettin crazy cash 
What's the 411? Let me know, hun 
What's the 411? 

Chorus

Vs.2- Mary J. Blige 
Yeah, nig, what makes you different from the next nigga 
Seen you last week 
And you couldn't even speak 
You try to play like Mr. All-of-that 
But now you wanna come to me with some chit-chat 
I don't have no time for no wham-bam thank you, ma'am 
Ghas me up, get me drunk and hit the the skinz and scram 
The same ol' shit you pulled last week on Pam 
I'm not havin that, No I'm not havin that 
You gotta do alot more and that's just how it be 
I'm Mary Blige and you just aint runnin up in me 
I need a man who's lookin out with some security 
So come correct with some respect and then we will see 
So if you with it, the drop the 7 digits 
And I might just give you a call 
If you aint with it, then don't waste you time at all 
So what's the 411, hun?
