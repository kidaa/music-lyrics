I've had some good days 
And I've had some bad days 
I know about heartbreak 
Didn't think that I can make it 
I know how it feels to have money 
I know how it feels to be broke 
And I can tell ya 'bout lonely 
Cause I've been there before 

Lord, when I raise my head up to the sky 
All of the emptiness was gone 
If you believe, you'll see in time 
That everything will be all right 

Chorus:
It's gonna be all right 
Everything will be ok 
This is her testimony -- Mary's story 
Trouble don't last always 

Through my trials and tribulations 
I still believe 
That god had a greater plan for me 
Exceeded all my expectations 
But when he gave me what I need 
And now I'm set free 

Lord, when I raise my head up to the sky 
All of the emptiness was gone 
If you believe, you'll see in time 
That everything will be all right 

Chorus

This is my story 
This is my song 
This is my song 
This is the day I celebrate 
My trouble's are gone 

Chorus

It's all right 
It's ok 
He wiped all my tears away 
He wiped them away 
It's all right 
It's ok 
Trouble don't last always 
Trouble don't last 

It's all right 
It's ok 
Said it don't last 
He wiped all my tears away 
He wiped all my 
It's all right 
It's ok 
Trouble don't last always 

Away, Away 
Away, Away he wiped 
Away
He cared for me 
Away
When nobody else did 
Away
He wiped my tears away 
Away
Away, Away 
Away, Away 
Away
