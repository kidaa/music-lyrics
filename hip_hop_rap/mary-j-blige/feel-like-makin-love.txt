Take my hand
Lead me to another place
I never been
I wanna be released
Set me free
I'm not talking bout letting me go
But I'm just talking bout pulling me close
To where our bodies are becoming as one
Turn off the lights cause boy we've just begun

Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight

Here I am
I'm all yours for tonight
But every night
It could be
You and I
For a lifetime
Could have stayed all to myself
And played the game like everybody else
But boy I want you and that's no lie
Because you keep me so satisfied

Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight

It would be nice if you spend the night
Ain't nothing wrong if you treat me right
Why don't we take it nice and slow
Hold on tight baby don't let go
It would be nice if you spend the night
Ain't nothing wrong if you treat me right
Why don't we take it nice and slow
Hold on tight baby don't let go

Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight
Feel like making love
All through the night
All through the night
Come hold me tight

It would be nice if you spend the night
Ain't nothing wrong if you treat me right
Why don't we take it nice and slow
Hold on tight baby don't let go
It would be nice if you spend the night
Ain't nothing wrong if you treat me right
Why don't we take it nice and slow
Hold on tight baby don't let go

[Chorus till fade]
