Vs.1
Now I've had my fouls with love 
Going through things I never heard of 
Breaking up and getting back together 
Faced with all kinds of stormy weather 

And there was a time 
I thought I'd lose my mind 
But my friends and family warned me 
Time after time after time 

Chorus:
Now tell me 
How you gonna get something 
When all you gave up is nothing 
Everyday, Everyday, Everyday, baby 
You twisted my mind 

Tell me why is it that I'm bugging 
Now that I got every thing 
Everyday, Every way, you're gonna pay baby For dissing my love 

Vs.1
Now baby it took a view 
For me to get over you 
I didn't think I could make it 
But my faith in God said I could shape it 

Back in the day I wasn't good enough for you 
I would do anything to win you over 
You took advantage of my attention 
Oh, did I forget to mention 

Bridge:
Everyday you did the same thing 
And every hour you switch up on me 
And every minute I'll be forgiving 
And every second we keep reliving 

Everyday you did the same thing 
And every hour you switch up on me 
And every minute I'll be forgiving 
And every second we keep reliving 

Chorus

It was your attitude 
That was much too shrewd 
Caused you to loose 
Now who's the fool 

Repeat chorus and adlib until fade
