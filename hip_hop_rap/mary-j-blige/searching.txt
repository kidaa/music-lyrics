[Chorus:]
Searching [repeat x15]

[Verse 1:]
Do you hear what I hear
Can you see what I see
Everybody's crying out
And yet we have no unity
My friends always ask me
Mary? tell me why do you weep
Cause I'm trying to get over
All the negativity
That's why I'm searching

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
We are living in a world
Of "Who has what?" and "Who is who?"
But I'm telling you my friend
The answer's right in front of you
We are searching for a peace
Piece of mind is what we need
We are searching for the love
That comes with the unity

Oh ooh oh oh
Oh ooh oh everyday
Oh ooh oh it rains
Oh ooh oh can you stand the pain?
Oh ooh oh why do we live the way we choose to live?
Oh ooh oh
Oh I'm telling you my brother right now that we got to be...

[Chorus]

Oh ooh oh oh
Oh ooh oh Why are we still searching
Oh ooh oh When the answer's right in front of you
Oh
Oh ooh oh I'm telling you
Oh ooh oh
Oh ooh oh you better look straight a head of your path
Oh Because the love is always there

[Chorus]

I don't wanna fuss n' fight
I just wanna make it right
What can we do to be strong
If we try to get along
I'm not trying to preach to you
But I am still searching too, yeah
Me and you can do it, oh
I don't ever wanna be stressed out
I just wanna live my life
The way I feel that I should be
Cause I wanna be happy, happy
What about you and me

[Chorus until fade]
