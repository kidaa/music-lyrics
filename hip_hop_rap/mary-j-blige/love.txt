Well it was like a party
But the kids seem to scatter off
Kids seem to scatter off
You told me all those lies
That I said you did
And I can't give one more chance
But I betcha I will show you
That the pick of a letter comes a little thicker
And I said it would
And it's been coming for a long time

L! 
Let's get you ready for another, another lifetime
O!
Our position is just to see what you can do
V!
Become a victim on the verge, I'll kick your ass now
E!
This is serious so you'll know what to do

You been wasting time
Are you out of your mind
Well you show me some love

With intentions high
You probably need a place to count your cash
Need a place to count your cash
You said you're sorry so many times
And I'm sorry that you ever did
Well you can take your life of love 
And stick it up in your main frame
Cause there'll be no more second chances
No more hot romances
And I like it this way
So let me break it down for you

[Chorus]

Better stop playin me 
Start lovin me
I ain't the same woman giving love for free
All my life sittin, thinkin how to please you
Been flyin so long now, my screws are loose
Now it's time to move
Cause I'm sick and tired of playin the fool
Cause you play to lose 
And I play to win
Tried not tosin
Treid to be your friend
Like every other girl 
Never sexed your friends
But it's over now
And you saying, "How"
I found something new
That worth the while
Instead of meesin with a bump cat poster child
But I'm focused now
People saying, "Wow!"
In place of a frown on my face, a smile
You must be out yo mind
I have no time to get you ready for a love of a liftime

[Chorus]

You been wasting time
Are you out of your mind
Well you show me some love

[Chorus]

[Ad-lib]
