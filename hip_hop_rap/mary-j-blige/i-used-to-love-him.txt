Chorus
Now I don't 
I used to love him 
Now I don't 
Now I don't 

Lauryn:
As I look at what I've done 
The type of life that I've lived 
How many things I pray the father will forgive 
One situation involved a young man 
He was the ocean and I was the sand 
He stole my heart like a thief in the night 
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight 
And I used to love him 

Chorus

Mary:
I chose the road of passion and pain 
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain 
Gave up my power 
Ceased being queen 
Addicted to love like the drug of, drug of a fiend 

Lauryn: See torn and confused, wasted and used 
Mary: Reached the crossroad which path would I choose 
Lauryn: Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated 
Mary: For something to happen that just wasn't fated 
Lauryn: Thought what I wanted was something I needed 
Mary: When mama said no then I just should have heeded 
Lauryn: Misled I bled till the poison was gone 
Mary: And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn 

Chorus

Lauryn:
Father you saved me and you showed me that life 
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife 

Mary:
Showed me that love was respect and devotion 
Greater than planets and deeper than any ocean 

Lauryn: See my soul was weary but now it's replenished 

Mary: Content because that part of my life is finished 

Lauryn: I see him sometimes and the look in his eye 
Mary: Is one of a man whose lost treasures untold 
Lauryn: But my heart is gold see I took back my soul 
Mary: And totally let my creator control 
Lauryn: The life which was his to begin with 

Chorus and adlibs until fade
