I will love you anyway 
even if you can not stay 
I think you are the one for me 
here is where you want to be 
I just want to satisfy 'ya 
you're not mine and I can't deny it 
don't you hear me talkin' baby 
love me now or I'll go crazy 

Chorus
Whoa, Sweet thang

Whoa, Sweet thang

I wish you were my lover 
but 'ya act so undercover 
Love 'ya child my whole life long 
is be right or be wrong 
I'm only what 'ya make me, baby 
don't walk away, don't be so shady 
don't want your mind, don't want your money 
These words I say, they may sound funny but...
