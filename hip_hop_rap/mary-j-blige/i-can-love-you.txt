feat. Lil' Kim

[Chorus]
I can love you, I can love you
I can love you, I can love you
I can love you better than she can

I can love you, I can love you
I can love you, I can love you
I can love you better than she can

[Vs.1]
Sitting here,
Wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you
And baby have no fear
Cause I would never ever hurt you
And you know my love is real, boy I can

[Chorus]

[Vs.2]
I know some times
Can get rough but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm
And I know I will try
To make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say

I can love you I can love you
A little better than she can
oh,
I know that you I know that you
Wish that you could be my man
Cause I can love you better than she can

[Chorus]

[Rap: Lil Kim]
If I told you once, I told you twice,
Q. B. throw the bootie, like a groupie for mo' ice
Armor truck heist, hit the bonus like N'Bushe,
In love wit' you since the days of "Juicy"
Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colassals, turn you castles to brothels, Uh!
Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin?
Dippin on ya Ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, Wha!
You work more body than Jane Fonda,
Physical fitness, Mary Blige be my witness
Under pressure, I lie for ya, die for ya
Cougar by the thigh for ya, right hand high for ya
Because of you, I'm inheritin' trillions,
Buryin' billions, Bentley Coupe's millions
Playin' good samaritan, in the Sheraton
Crack the Don P's and Remy's
You better hurry in

Won't you tell me who?
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do
Who's gone love you like I do, huh? What
Who's gone treat you like I do, huh? What
Nobody, nobody
Mary Blige, Lil Kim, ha ha
Queen Bee, ah-hah, that's me
That's right, Mary J, Lil K

Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody

[Chorus until fade]
