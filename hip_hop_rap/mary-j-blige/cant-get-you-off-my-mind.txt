feat. The Lox

Uh, Darkchild, wha'
Ohh, Mary J. Blige

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Said I couldn't do it again, but I did

[Chorus]
Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' about you all the time
Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' about you all the time

[Vs.1]
The day we met was the last day
That I said I would look anyone else's way
Now you know that I'm with you
And I'll always be true
There's nothing in this world
That I won't do for you

[Chorus]

[Vs.2]
The day you left, it was so sad
Now I'm standin' here holdin' on to the past
keep going on - gotta live your life
If we grow up in time
Maybe real love we will find

[Chorus]

Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa...yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa

[Rap: The LOX]
[Styles:]
You need rocks on the 4th finger
Of your left hand
Tell your bride's maid to hit off my best man
Always on my mind like money
You my honey, there when I'm laced, there when I'm bummy

[Sheek:]
Say word, it's type hard for me to get you off my mind
But I still get dough of course
True love, between a thug and a dove
Poppin' champagne in the tub, wha!

[Jadakiss:]
Ay yo, everything revolves around trust
Cause if it wasn't for you, then they wouldn't be no us
No jealousy, envy, and no lust
3-2-8 off the lot when I bust
Sittin' in the house countin' Lincolns and I'm still thinking
Can't get you off so I'm blinkin'
Sinkin', down in the silk couch, milked out
Your hole in my heart got my love all spilled out

Ooh, I can't get you...

[Chorus]

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus until fade]
