Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh 
Baby
Whatcha gonna do 
Baby
My, my, my love 

Vs.1
I was a fool to let you in 
Knowing you would play with my heart 
But that was so long ago that I 
Thought we could make a new start 
You left me broken hearted 
From the day your love departed 
Now that love you found with someone new is gone 
And so you wanna come back 

Chorus
Whatcha gonna do without my love 
My love 
Whatcha gonna do without my love 

Whatcha gonna do without my love 
My love 
Whatcha gonna do 
Now that my love has gone away from you 

Vs.2
Sweet memories of yesterday 
When it all seemed so right 
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight 
I wish you know that a woman 
That you learn to leave today 
And it's a shame that you wanna come back now baby 
My love has gone away 

Chorus

Bridge

I played the fool for you baby 
And you stole away my heart 
Whatcha gonna do 
Now that my love is gone away 
Whatcha gonna do 
Sweet memories of yesterday 
Whatcha gonna do 
Now that my love is gone away 

Chorus repeat and ad-libs until fade
