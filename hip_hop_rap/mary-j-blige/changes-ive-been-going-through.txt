Oh, don't you wanna be with me 

Chorus
Can't you see what I've been going through 
Cause I wanna be with you 
Baby, don't you wanna be with me? 
Changes I've been going through 
Cause I wanna be with you 

Vs.1
It's all gone 
The love I thought we shared is gone away 
Maybe it's better that we didn't stay together 

Seems like we've gone through this a thousand times 
Maybe I still don't have the answer 
Why can't you tell me why we couldn't be together 

Chorus

Vs.2
See I didn't want to ever hold you tight 
But still I need love and affection 
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention 

Tell me baby, did I push you away 
Was I coming on to strong for you 
Why can't you tell me, tell me what am I supposed to do 
Oh can't you see 

Chorus
