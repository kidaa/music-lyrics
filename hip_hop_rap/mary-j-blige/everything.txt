You are my everything 
You are my everything 
You, my everything 
Everything, everything, everything 
Vs.1
It's all because of you 
I'm never sad and blue 
You've brightened up my days 
In your own special way 
Whenever you're around 
I'm never feeling down 
You are my trusted friend 
On you I can depend 

Bridge
You take me away 
From the pain 
And you bring me paradise 
And when there were cloudy 
days you brought sunshine in my life 
It never occurred 
To me the first time I saw your face 
I would fall so deep in love 
That your love can't be replaced 

chorus:
You are my everything you are my everything 
love so good, so good only you can bring 
You are my everything 
You are everything 
and everything is you 

Vs.2
My darling only you 
Can make my dreams come true 
And every night I pray 
You'll never go away 
I promise I will try 
Until the day I die 
To treat you like a king 
Cause you are my everything 

Bridge

Chorus

You are everything 
And everything is you 
Repeat 4x's 

When you're lovin me 
Put your lovin arms around me 
When you're lovin me 
Said I feel so safe I found security 
When you're lovin me 
Forever I want you home with me 
My everything 
my every every every everything 

Chorus

You take me away
