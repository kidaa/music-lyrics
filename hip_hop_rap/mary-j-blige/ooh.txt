[1st Verse:]
In the middle of the night.
When you hold me tight.
Say it's all right.
I'm yours forever.
I do what you want.
If you don't hurt me.
I'll cook and clean.
I'll make you happy.

[Chorus:]
And ooh!
What you do to me.
Ooh! You're my everything.
And ooh! I'm so glad I found you.
Ooh! I can't live wit out you.

[2nd Verse:]
Got a Jones in my bones.
And it's all for you baby.
Can't leave you alone.
I'm so addictive.
I can't shake this thang.
It's the sweetest pain.
So who's your girl?
You better say my name.

[Chorus:]
And ooh! What you do to me.
Ooh! You're my everything.
And ooh! I'm so glad I found you.
Ooh! I can't live wit out you.

[Bridge:]
What you do to me, it's just a mystery.
It's hard to believe that you our here with me.
Making all my dreams a sweet reality.
All my life I tried to find what is best for me.

[Repeat Chorus 3x]
