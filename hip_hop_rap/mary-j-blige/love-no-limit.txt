Vs.1
Baby, there's no need to tell ya' 
As far as I can clearly recall 
my love has been here for you 
So you don't have to worry at all 
I'll sacrifice my time 
I'll make sure you're satisfied 
And it's no hard thing to the joy I bring 
I wanna give you all my love 

Chorus
Loving you every day 
don't you look no more 
love without a limit 
Loving you every day 
don't you look no more 
love without a limit 

Vs.2
Baby, I'm in need of your love 
and you got that touch 
that I need so much 
and I am about to explode 
Freely, completely, everything you want I'll be 
good love down to the last drop 
and I'm not gonna stop 

Chorus

Bridge
Loving you is all I wanna do 
Loving you is all I wanna do 
Loving you, said loving you 
is all that I, all that I wanna do 
baby, baby, baby, heeeeey 

During Chorus 
I'm loving you everyday 
Loving you everyday every hour baby 
Don't look no more, don't look no more 
Loving you everyday 
Loving you babe everyday
