Someday at Christmas 
Men won't be boys 
Playing with balms 
Like kids play with toys 
One warm December 
All hearts will see 
A world where men are free 

Someday at Christmas 
They'll be no wars 
When we have learned 
What Christmas is for 
When we have learned 
What life's really worth 
They'll be peace on Earth 

Someday all are dreams will come to be 
Someday in a world where men are free 
Maybe not in time for you and me 
But someday at Christmas time 

Someday at Christmas 
We'll see a land 
With no hungry children 
And no empty hands 
One happy morning 
People will share 
A world where people care 

Someday at Christmas 
They'll be no more tears 
Where all men are equal 
And no man has fears 
One shinning morning 
We're on our way from today 
But Someday at Christmas time 

Someday all are dreams will come to be 
Someday in a world where men are free 
Maybe not in time for you and me 
But someday at Christmas time 

Someday at Christmas 
Men will not care 
Hate will be gone 
And love will prevail 
Someday a new world that we can start 
With hope in every heart 

Someday all are dreams will come to be 
Someday in a world where men are free 
Maybe not in time for you and me 
But someday at Christmas time 
Someday at Christmas time
