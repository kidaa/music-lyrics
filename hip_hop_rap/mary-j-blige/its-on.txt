Chorus
And it's on, and it's on, 
and it's on, and it's on, 
And it's on tonight 
It's about time that we met 
And it's about time a love I won't forget

R. Kelly: 
For so long I've waited for the chance 
To be with you 
And to lie with you baby 
In my dreams I take you by the hand 
In our house on the beach 
Making love on jet black sand 

bridge:
Baby finally the time 
Has come for us to share 
The joy that we will need 
And nothing can compare 

Chorus

Vs.2
Mary J.: 
I waited all my life 
Boy for you to come along 
And make that joyful sacrifice 
Two kids, a dog, and a home 
Is like a dream come to life 
When I look into your dazing eyes 

Bridge

Chorus

All my life I've waited 
To get next to you 
You, baby you 
And every night I've prayed 
Your love would come my way  
And finally the time 
Has come for us to be lovers 

Chorus
