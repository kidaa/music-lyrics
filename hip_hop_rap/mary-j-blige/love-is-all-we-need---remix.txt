Foxxy rap: 
Trackmasters, commisioner 
You say you keep me laced in everything 
Baguettes his and her's 
Matchin' E-class, twin chincilla furs 
Everything was real 'til he slipped the swerve, 
Swore that the love was real then he bounced with hers 
Kept me off speed. Blessed me backwards 
Made my heart bleed 
Killed me softly, he don't know how much he cost me 
If the love is all we need, real queens will survive Now peep the remix with Fox and J. Blige 

Vs.1
I've got to let you know 
That this is the only way 
Troubles far and near but have no fear 
Cause love is always on the way 
Oh, love... 

Chorus 
Love is all we need 
To make every little thing complete 
Love is all we need 
To make every little thing complete 

Vs.2
If you don't know then I'm telling you 
It works with everything you do 
Problems everyday but we'll find a way 
'Cause love is gonna save the day 

Chorus

Bridge: 
Do you know what we really need 
Do you know that love is going to set us free 
That is you and me 
Do you think we can live this way 
Cause I know love is going to save the day 
In every way 

Chorus 
Bridge 2: 
Love is all we need to make everything better 
love is all we need, love is all we need 
It's the only way to live together 
Repeat bridge2 

chorus 

Love is all we need J. Blige come on
