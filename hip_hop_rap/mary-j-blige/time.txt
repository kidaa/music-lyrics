[1] - If I have my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side on our side
Don't you that time is not on our side
Because time is not on our side on our side

The end is coming, stop your running
I'm telling you this is the truth
You can talk about what you read about
Everything is on the news
People nowadays so shady
Now what is wrong with them
Something cast a spell up on their minds
And they always wanna condemn

[Repeat 1]

While your judging me you should look around
And you'll see how people going down
Some of them are killed over a dime
Now tell me do we really have time
To continue with this madness
Cause I'm sick and tired of this
Trying to crush my world with jealousy
And I'm about to catch a fit

[Repeat 1]

You're deceiving
What's the meaning
Of you're retrieving
The enemy's greeting
We all are leaving someday but
We don't know how we are going
Please believe me when I tell you
That time is not really on our side

[Repeat 1 till end]
