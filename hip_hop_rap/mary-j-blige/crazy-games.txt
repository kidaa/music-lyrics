Verse 1: 
Once he seen you get so comfortable 
Never wantin to commit fo sho 
Always lying bout the girl next door 
That's how all these things began 
You let you gaurd down and he does you in 
All you secrets hes been holdin that in 
To throw back at you when it benifits him 
So he can go and play with all his chickens 

Chorus: 
Tell me where the lyin and the front begun 
Why you playin wit me cuz it ain't fun 
How can it be two if I'm your only one 
That's how crazy this game is 
Workin so hard to complete ourselves 
Never thinkin that our love was on the shelf 
Livin our life like there was no one else 
That's how crazy this game is 

Verse 2: 
Who you messin with cuz all the games you play 
Oh you didn't know my name was Mary J 
All the chicks you hear that heard they all look slave 
tryin ta gas me sayin things have changed 
Now your like the furthest thing from my brain 
Never thought I had to say it to you this way 
All these years I been with you boy I feel so played 
Now I need to go jump in my blazer 

chorus
