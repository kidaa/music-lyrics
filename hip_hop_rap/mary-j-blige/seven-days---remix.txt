Vs.1
I've been searching for someone, [Yes I have] 
But never did I think he would be you 
I've been looking high and low, up and down, 'round the world 
For my perfect you 

I never thought that I 
Would have to step to you 
About the way you move 
But this conversation is due 
Let it be known, if we're together 
I refuse to be your fool 
Trust me, the last thing you wanna do 
Is make me loose my cool 

Chorus
Monday a friend of mine 
Tuesday we played a game 
Wednsday you went away 
Thursday things weren't the same 
On Friday you came back 
I wanted to kiss you on Saturday 
On Sunday we made love 
Now what are we gonna do? 

[Check this out] 
Don't claim your ass is ready when you're not 
'Cause if you play me out, I'll blow up your spot 
And I don't care where you are or what you say or what you do 
And I don't care who ya with 
It could be your bitch or even your crew 

I never thought that I 
Would have to step to you 
About the way you move 
But this conversation is due 
Now let it be known, if we're together 
I refuse to be your fool 
Trust me, the last thing you wanna do 
Is make me loose my cool 

Chorus Repeat 2x's 

Mary talks: 
Let me talk to you for a minute 
Now I'm sick and tired of being confused 
One day you say you're my friend and the next day you my lover 
I mean, make up your mind 
'Cause I can't keep chillin', I want somebody for me 
And if you can't understand that, then be out! 

Chorus Repeat and adlib until fade
