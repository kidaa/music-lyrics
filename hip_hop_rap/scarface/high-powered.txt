Doing time for that he say and she say laying niggas down on the freeway.
Believe me they need me cause all these mouse ass niggas

Beep beep there goes the sound of my cellar, heres the life of a hustler.

[Verse 2:]
Deal with it, dont talk he be about it, cause he a G about it.
I got a problem with a nigga, I go squeeze him out.
What the fuck I am going to talk to the police about.
I am from the streets doing the type of shit you read about.
I cooped the Chrome 45 under pressure.
And then address ya, now ya froze on the streture.
You wanted trouble, and I wouldnt settle lesser.
I am the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector.
See my reflection as it fades in the black,
when I reappear on a nigga. Its a ragging attack yeah.
And soloulome swear, any problem I here.
I just empty the clip, for him calling me to dis square.
Thats on my life, that causes me to represent the Mob.
Since you niggas want that heat I am about to turn up the knob.
To High Powered!

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Bitch nigga you catch a dead man walking.
One foot is inside of a grave.
The other one is in a closed top coffin.
You still talking, like you the old G,
when you was locked down thou you was low key.
The niggas told me they had you in Sig, in the Locust.
You were working with those boys and them,
and even had the nerve to try and talk to the streets.
Thinking that they bring some mark ass police.
And then he tried to sue a nigga,
but it got back to a nigga.
And when I see him, I am do the nigga.
So skip that funky ass deposition fools.
If you want it, crank it up.
Thats what I am about to do, to High Powered
