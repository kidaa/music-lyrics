Push It To The Limit

Push it to the limit 
Walk along the razor's edge 
but don't look down, just keep your head 
and you'll be finished 

Open up the limit 
past the point of no return 
You've reached the top but still you gotta learn 
how to keep it 

Hit the wheel and double the stakes 
throttle wide open like a bat out of hell 
and you crash the gates 
crash the gates 

Going for the back of beyond 
Nothing gonna stop you 
there's nothing that strong 
So close now you're nearly at the brink 
so, push it 

Ooo yeah 

Welcome to the limit 
The limit 
Take it maybe one step more 
The power game's still playing so 
you better win it 

Push it to the limit 
The limit 
With no one left to stand in your way 
you might get careless, but you'll never be safe 
while you still feel it 

Welcome to the limit 
The limit 
Standing on the razor's edge 
don't look down just keep your head 
and you'll be finished 

Welcome to the limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit 

Push it to the limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit 

The limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit 

Push it to the limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit 
The limit
