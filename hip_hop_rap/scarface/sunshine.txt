[verse 1:]

He wanted drama so I brought him pain
wadadadang
listen to my nine millimeter go bang
out goes your brains; feel the motherfuckin terror
and you ain't felt the comin of death like this ever
you paused; and now I got a Colt 45
semiautomatic explodin between your eyes; surprise 
you never thought your yesterdays would come back to haunt you
but believe me, I've come back to haunt you
I'm bout to bring your dog days to you mista
cause rules in the streets you come off we come get ya
and hit ya'; and I done let you slide a few times
but eventually you gots to die in due time
sunshine

[chorus: x2]

sunshine 
everybody needs
sunshine
my life, my life, my life

[verse:]

his mama must've got the news 
the little boy that she gave birth to was on of them niggas they pulled 
out the room
and all my other little homies stood shocked
while they watched my other little homie bleed non-stop
on the other side of sorrow is a father being torn
apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue 
he mourned cuz now he got to deal with the fact
that his child is gone and tears can't bring him back
turn on the T.V. and seen the unabomber
I flew to D.C., still they got no karma
and everybody say they think its all gonna change
you paint me pictures, but they all look the same
its strange, I'm standin in my own frame of thought
remainin in the street game framin which I was taught
I was taught to always keep my eyes open wide
cause in these streets you got to ride or you die
I've seen a child born and I've seen a man die 
can't live forever and I understand why
so when your time comes will you crawl or be brave
and in between judgement will you fall or be saved 
sunshine

[chorus]

[verse 3:]

tears rolled town his face as he stared at his potna
with his chest full of holes and his head full of coppa
broke his ass off something propa; he's in the morgue
with his brains in a shitbag and a toetag on-gone
this motherfucka must've thought he was a cat
and had nine lives but ended up on his back
and then the reaper came and took control of your mind
and you can't think you got a hole in your mind
you dyin' and can't nobody bring you out your coma
when this nigga brought the end and turned the lights out for ya
see ya and I wouldn't want to be in your position
cause starin' the shaft of a strap and you the mission
means one thing you let a mothafucka catch you on the sneak tip
and put your ass off in some deep shit; got the deep six
and everybody sad sendin' flowers to your ceremony
they lost thier motherfuckin' homey
damn Audi 5 on some dumb shit
and motherfuckers steady riskin their safety behind this dumb shit
but I refuse to give a nigga mine
I give a nigga nine

[chorus]
