I went from Inglewood to H-Town tryin' to put the hustle down
but I could already tell these bitch niggas wanna clown
like I'm the new jack of the city but I ride like nina roll
  I can see now one eighty seven got to be the penal code
I'm fed up that's it that's all fuck that get it get it
  since he bullshitted   ran with it
a murder must be committed
Now the kidnap got to go down
In other words I got to steal him
then put the pistol to his grill  
cock the hammer back   kill him
[Face]
We finna get him   once we get him
gotta make a statement
He fucked the family
man to respect 'em we gotta waste him
No hesitatin' heat him up   leave him on the pavement
then find his momma so she can help us find her baby
Nigga are you crazy?
We don't bullshit when it comes to payday

or in public places we dumpin' on ya like that

We got to blast who you think with

red dot marks the spot

When asked about the paper he owe he kept drivin'
