Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigger's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen
I was no singer, knot on my face
But no chose another time and a place
That I would revenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happen last night
Knuckle-game changed quicker than lighting
Hit 'em, slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, its the fastlife
My product give another nigger advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cuz this life, how many you get?
How many niggers do you know the two
Besides a nigger who snitch to skip a life-bid
Be one in your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect thoughtout knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, catch your mental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggers do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It not your enemy you get you
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
I be wondering, can I trust my friends?
Will they stab me in my back everytime they can?
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With the little strength I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons, in between us, came between us

[Scarface]
I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sitting, wishing my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggers start looking at me different than this
I'm down to play the real nigger shit to get with a bitch
But I'ma tell a motherfucker like this
You going good is what you come up against
Nigger you get what you get
So the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, weel I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggers know I
Don't believe in letting shit slid, nigger gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
The homeboy demeanor, but let the bullshit come between us
