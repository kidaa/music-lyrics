cause i wont give a shee to a nigga starvin
so we can fluss and blow weed hangin' with the warden

puting your baby to sleep
and turn of your ring and you can catch me on banewick

Deathwall is the site
when the mic be light
as twice as shipp advice to my homies who write me in te pine
Now the sale is hell but kids keep sending me mail
with their laberty bell, so i can tell you about the half
and who got cow for riches, and sending bithces, 
i'm making bitches
I remember when i just to get beat with extensioncars
and we slanged by to see were my house was
started stealing out of my mama's perce
now that she's gone
she lives thrue my songs
and it sure hurts
i couldn't  have treated her worse then in the ghetto
and turn our womens into wideows
sick to see my homie that i ain't with, trade with, payed with, laughed with
dead in a casket.
to my pumps we can reach the top
but you got a chance to get of the pop
if you see your chance baby take it
i was the last mothafucka in the world who thoiught i would make it
but look at me now, a six on the beach in greeze
check from the muthafucka stretts of the ghetto

[Chorus:]
Ghetto,
Ghetto.
I can't get out of here
ghetto
nigga
ghetto 
i can't get out of here
