He's on the level if he's inclined.
The son of a devil, he wants mine and more.
Ooh, he's a high, high climber.
Not just a clinging vine.
He made the grade, he made his marks, senor,
And guess who's keeping score? 

Rush rush, got the yeyo? 
Buzz buzz, gimme yeyo.
Rush rush, got the yeyo? 
Uh oh.
Yo yo, no no yeyo.

He's a real speed demon.
He's one of a kind.
Watching, waiting, winking over his shoulder.
He's running out of time.

Rush rush to the yeyo.
Buzz buzz, gimme yeyo.
Uh oh.
Yo yo, no no yeyo.
Go go.
Rush rush to the yeyo.

Never, never take a chance before you know he's in a hurry.
Better better make your mind up boy, he's faster, he's faster, he's faster, he's faster.

Rush rush, gimme yeyo.
Buzz buzz buzz, gimme yeyo.
Uh oh.
No no, gimme yeyo.
Yo yo, dame yeyo.
Uh oh.

Rush rush, gimme yeyo.
Buzz buzz buzz, gimme yeyo.
Uh oh.

Yo yo, dame yeyo.
Uh oh.

He's a real speed demon.
He's one of a kind.
Watching, waiting, winking over his shoulder.
He's running out of time, time, time, time.
