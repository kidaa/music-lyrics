Chorus: x4	{Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the mutha fucking flow
		{Here comes the White Sheet

Verse 1:
Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the mutha fucking flow
so why was you fucking with a nigga for?
apparently you haven't heard of me?
it's going to take more mutha fuckers than in the compound to murder me
I fucks a vision like a sand shower
you going up against a stacked deck nigga, now where your man power
bring your mutha fucking backup
and blow the bugle when I step off this bitch and load this gat up
coz still a nigga's friend will bust you
dead in your head from the front and knock the back up off that mutha 
fucker
now listen to the gunshot
I got that ass with that double barrel one shot
now I don't hear your heart beating
now I don't see your boy breathing, rat tat tat tat.

Chorus x4

Hospital Scene:
Wassup boy?/ah, ah, wassup Face 1?/where that nigga at?/ah, he back 
there in that emergency room/ he did?/I, I don't know man/ fun to bust 
this bitch again.

Verse 2:
I see your mama in the waiting room standing crying
I see your ass in the doctors arms slowly dying
now talk that shit that you was talking to your homie
bitch you should have shot me when you pulled your fucking pistol on me
so now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the mutha fucking A, nigga set tripping
it ain't no love when my finger's on the trigger
it ain't no love for you off balance ass niggas
so keep your ass in the neutral spot
'cause if you rolling through my hood when we're feuding then you 
getting caught

Chorus x4

Verse 3:
I ain't your mutha fucking homeboy
you out of pocket when you fucking with me, so no it's on boy
I ain't but in to get my shit like these other busters
when you see me around this bitch I got that mutha fucker
so I ain't fucking with the club life
I'm like Pac, I'm making mail but I still live the thug life
my rap name's getting bigger
but ain't nothing changed I still got the game to handle all you bitch 
niggas
so a nigga's always strapped
nuts been big since a kid you mutha fucker so it ain't rap
toe to toe, back to back, gat for gat,
it's like that mutha fucker... rat tat tat tat.
