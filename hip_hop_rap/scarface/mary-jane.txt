Scarface whispering:
I don't really remember feeling like this

Got this love formin' in my lifefrom this dame
And indeed took the form of lifeit's a shame 
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folksgot 'em high 
For the days that they were lost and brokeshit got 'em by 
Only right was stopping it from props 
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane

chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

When the world starts to stress you outwhat you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouthor grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains isthey the blame
And the government's been taxin' that    -- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not 
And the alcohol is killin' folks true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got 
A true friend in my time of needall I need 
Your natural you come from seedsI decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane

chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
