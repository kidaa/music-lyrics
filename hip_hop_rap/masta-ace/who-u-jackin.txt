Verse One:  Paula Perry, Masta Ase
One two one two, check it I can't stay home
Gotta take walk down to block to the pay phone
";Do you run?"; No, like I said before I walk
Stick up kids hawk, but I don't stop to talk
I keep my hand on my pocket on my razor
get too close and I'ma have to graze ya
Like night and early morning scheming at dawn and
Looking to jack what I want
  Back back back you better watch yours
  I got yours
  Cut you like I got claws
  Stick em up because
  It's a roothless toothless
  Waiting inna thick here
  Looking for a vict, yeah
  How about this chick here?
Who's this standing at the corner?
I wonder if he's on a
Mission to stick cuz he's a goner
Polo padding yang lacking and fucked up packing
Get dacking
Nigga who you jackin?
Verse Two: Masta Ase, Paula Perry
I'm come comin to get cha, with your bangles in your ears
With your Gucci link and I ain't snatched a chain in years
When a pocket full kicka kicka granny inna back and
when I see you little doe, hey, i dont know how to act
  Well... I'm not your neighborhood nice girl, I'm raw as coke
  So scheemin seemin I'ma play ya like a bad joke
  You're trying to stab me, but I'm not the one
  I'll pistol-whip that ass, and I don't even have a gun
I put my foot up to the ass
Of a bitch that think she got class fast
Give up the cash as you can not pass
Feedin readin, I dont mean the grass

Well, I'ma jiggaboo, with an attitude
Better to slice and dice and sway like I saw don't get through
Make your moves so I can dat that bullshit

This aint no movie so dont be actin
Stupid on a girl like me, nigga who you jackin?
Verse Three: Masta Ase, Paula Perry
Ya just skin an' bones so ya need to change the tones

  But I'ma slice you in half fuck it I ain't butter
