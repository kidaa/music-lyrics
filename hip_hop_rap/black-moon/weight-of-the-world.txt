For all my life
You will be the only one for me
Eternally
Tell me you will be mine
It is more than a sign
We have nothing to hide
For now and forever open your heart
I wanna be by your side
I swear that I love you
I swear it tonight
You make me feel alive
I need you be my side for every day and night
Without a doubt a touch of you
Means more than a thousands words it never hurts
I cant help feeling this way
Day by day your magic to me
There is no need to deny I really know why
You are mine endlessly
For now and forever open your heart
I wanna be by your side
I swear that I love you
I swear it tonight
For now and forever open your heart
I wanna be by your side
I swear that I love you
I swear it tonight
I know that no one else could ever take your place
Your smiling face
Don't you feel for all my life
You will be the only one for me eternally
Tell me you will be mine it is more than a sign
I wanna be by your side
Since our love has began we are 2 hearts as one
We have nothing to hide
For now and forever open your heart
I wanna be by your side
I swear that I love you
I swear it tonight
For now and forever open your heart
I wanna be by your side
I swear that I love you
I swear it tonight
