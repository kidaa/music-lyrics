If I had my way
I would never go back
with my back to the wall
I just let myself fall
watch the daytimes turn black
but now and again I find
you cross my mind

If I was a train
I would never slow down
with my head in the sky
and the world going by
every nowhere town
as I write one more letter to you
I know I can't change the things that I do

one day
when you discover
just why I ran
ran away from you lover
I know I'm to blame
I feel so ashamed
call out your name
after the rain

what do you want me to do
I've thrown away everything for you
well I've wasted my dreams
each day it seems
I'm losing my way back to you

It's time for a change
what else can I do
the clock ticking time
I better make up my mind
is it me or is it you
yeah tonight as I'm losing control
I will drink to the queen of my soul

one day
when you discover
just why I ran
ran away from you lover
I know I'm to blame
I feel so ashamed
call out your name
after the rain...
