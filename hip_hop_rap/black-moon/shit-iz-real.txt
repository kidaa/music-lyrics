I run, I fall
I walk, I sometimes crawl
I give, I take
I bend and yet somehow I break

I get dizzy from all this spinning 'round
I'm determined but wonder where I'm bound
I've learned to follow the sweet familiar sound of your voice

The straight and narrow twists and turns
I make my way and everyday I live I learn to follow You
You walk me through a maze of grace

I stand, I sway
I reach for you, I push away
I'm spent, I'm saved
I disobey, yet I behave

In my personal struggle to break free
The only peace for the puzzle that I need
Is just to follow the sweet familiar lead of your love

The straight and narrow twists and turns
I make my way and everyday I live I learn to follow You
You walk me through a maze of grace
I'm lost in You and there I'm found
You're gently guiding
Everytime I turn around it's no surprise
To see my life's a maze of grace
