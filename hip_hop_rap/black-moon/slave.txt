Intro: D   G  4 times

D                G                 D                  G
Now don't get bent out of shape,   don't start tearing out your hair
D                G           D               G
One a sweet little angel,      that stuff's nowhere
D                           G             D                        G
When the bombs go off on Oxford Street      and the kids beat up old people
D                    G               D             G
It's just a soundtrack for your life     it's just everyday evil

CHORUS
Dm                       Bb   Dm                     Bb
Don't let it break you down Don't let it break you down
Dm                      Bb      D  G   D   G
Don't let it break you down

Some people are in charge of pens that shouldn't be in charge of brooms
They have the nerve to rip up a man's life in a paragraph or two
And the aeroplanes get hijacked and all the Americans get killed
And the children are addicted to a sugar-coated pill

CHORUS  then E  G  D three times

Well you get sent out on the racetrack, you get spurs dug in your cheeks
You'll see a winning post in the distance that you'll never reach
And there's a hole in the atmosphere gets bigger every time you spray your hair
And someone's drilling down through the earth just to see what's there

CHORUS  twice, then instrumental section with
grunts and soft guitar and then ends on D
