Dancing violet dreams
Joining nights of satin fame
Acting jewel games.
All forgiven, you streak my heart.
More than pleasure in ice cold flames
Crying soft, as love flies tame
Swelling tears in diaries of lies
Fading lights, as songs die quiet.
Bleeding sweet for dying blind
Masking fears of silent decline
Cherry Orchards
Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards
August fades like tears in vain.
Winter's final shine
Dressing gold, one last time.
Seep from lace
Roses for an unborn face.
More than pleasure in ice cold flames
Crying soft, as love flies tame
Swelling tears in diaries of lies
Fading lights, as songs die quiet.
Bleeding sweet for dying blind
Masking fears of silent decline
Cherry Orchards
Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards
August fades like tears in vain.
