Combustion, suggestions, roaring engines
Jewels and lathes that build a world
Titanic Howard Hughes, an aimless king
Always spoiling the best things you done
So red squares and wavy leaves
Delicate glass kisses, delicate lips
Russian autumn heart
Testing, digressing, falling to the earth
Red-hot spaceships with soil so rich
A trillion pennies for a handful of dust
A sight only witnessed by a mountain of ice
So red squares and wavy leaves
Sibling link meets Manchurian mink
Russian autumn heart
Combustion, suggestions, roaring engines
Jewels and lathes that rule the world
Titanic Howard Hughes, an aimless king
Always spoiling the best things you done
So red squares and wavy leaves
Delicate glass kisses, delicate lips
Russian autumn heart
