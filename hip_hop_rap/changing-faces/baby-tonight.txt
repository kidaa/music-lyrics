Come closer, listen to me 
Baby I'm sure, I've got just what you need 
You want me hmmm, and I want you just the same 
And I'm not gonna stop, until you call my name 
I could be... 

I could be yours, and you could be mine 
You can be my baby tonight 
And if it feels good, and if it feels right 
You can be my baby tonight... 

Let's not waste precious time, hmmm 
Just say the words, and I'll make you mine oh 
Lay me down, and stroke my body 
Baby take your time, make love to me 
Do you mind... 

Do you mind, if I stroke you up and down 
Make you feel, like you've never felt before 
Open up, let me give you more 
Let me be, your baby tonight... 

CHORUS 

You can be my, you can be my 
You can be my baby tonight
