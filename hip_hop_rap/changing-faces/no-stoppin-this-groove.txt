[Charisse] 
I feel this vibe now 
And it's right here 
So throw your hands up in the air 
Wave 'em like you just don't care 
Come on, get in the mood, mmm 
This crowd is jumpin', keep it pumpin' 
Shake your rump and just do somethin' 
Come on now

Ain't no stoppin' this groove 
Ain't no stoppin' this groove 
Ain't no stoppin' this groove 

[Cassandra] 
I'm livin' it up ya'll 
I'm bout to have a ball 
Cause I'm in the mood to let my guards down 
And feel this groove 
And you should be feelin' it too 
Gotta keep it right because tonight is the night 

There ain't no stoppin' us tonight 
No attitudes, we feel all right 
We're doin' what we wanna do 
So come on now, enjoy this groove 
There ain't no No, no, no
