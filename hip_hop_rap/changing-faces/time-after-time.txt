I'm lying in my bed 
I hear the clock tickin' 
And I think of you 
Caught up in circles 
Confussion is nothing new

Flashback, warm nights 
Almost left behind 
Suitcase full of memories 
Time after time

Sometimes you picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead 
Your calling out to me 
But I can't hear a thing you say

Go slow and I fall behind ooooooooo 
And the second hand unwinds oooooooo
