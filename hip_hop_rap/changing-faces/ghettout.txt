Sittin' there, sittin' there, sittin' there, all alone 
I been feeling kinda strange lately 
I don't know what's going on, baby 
Ever since I came back from out of town 
Something's telling me some bullshit is going down 
[Chorus 1] 
Boy is there someone else you're seeking 
Is it someone else 
My vital's telling me you're creeping 
Finding numbers in your jeans 
You're talking in your sleep 
Faded letters written by me 
[Chorus 2] 
No more sittin' at home alone 
While you're out with somebody else 
No more staring at the phone 
Cuz I can do bad all by myself 
Yeah, it's obvious how things have changed within a year 
Just give me half of the rent and get outta here 
No more talking save your lines for somebody else 
Keep on walking cuz I can do better by myself 
[Chorus 1] 
[Chorus 2] 
[Chorus 2] 
I gave you all, all of my time 
But you would not know a good thing 
If it stares you in your face 
[Chorus 1] 
[Chorus 2] 
[Chorus 2] 
Oh oh oh oh 
Hey ey ey ey 
Oh oh oh oh 
Repeat Chorus 2 until fade
