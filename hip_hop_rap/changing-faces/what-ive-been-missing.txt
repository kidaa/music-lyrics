1 -   You give me  
     All this love that I've been missing  
     You make me  
     Show the feelings I wanna hide  
     No other love compares  
     To the love you're giving  
     You give me  
     What I've been missing at home  

What is this feeling about  
Oh yes this feeling I've been feeling  
It always comes around  
Whenever I'm thinking bout you  
Tell me what do I do  
When I got a love that I'm supposed to love  
You're giving me  
What I've been missing at home  

Repeat 1  

I should be satisfied  
With the love that I already have  
Content about  
About the things that he does  
But I need so much more  
So much more than he can offer  
So much more than what he's giving at home  

Repeat 1  

You give me so much joy  
Never knew what I was missing  
Feelings I just can't deny  
No other love compares  
To the love that you've been givng  
You're what I've been missing at home  

Repeat 1 til end of song
