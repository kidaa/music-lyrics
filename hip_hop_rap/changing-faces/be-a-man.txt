You said before me 
Your relationships were short 
They never did last too long 
Said every time you thought 
You found pretty Mrs. Right 
She turned out to be Mrs. Wrong 

You always worked late 
Didn't have much time to play 
And she couldn't relate to you 
She couldn't understand 
You're a hardworking man 
You need a woman like me who do 
Cuz I'll say... 

Go and get your paper, babe 
You won't hear nothing out of me 
Honey ain't no time for play 
See the bills got to get paid 

We gotta eat everyday 
And nothing in life comes for free 
So go ahead and get what you can 
I got your back, baby, be a man 

So now you found me 
Someone that you can adore 
And you know I adore you too 
Somebody that's strong 
And got it goin' on 
And won't solely depend on you 

As crazy as it seems 
I'ma let you do your thing boy 
?? you are to me 
See I can understand that you are just a man 
Tryin' to be all that he can be 
I'll say... 

Go and get your paper, babe 
You won't hear nothing out of me 
Honey ain't no time for play 
See the bills got to get paid 

We gotta eat everyday 
And nothing in life comes for free 
So go ahead and get what you can 
I got your back, baby, be a man 

Go and get your paper, babe 
You won't hear nothing out of me 
Honey ain't no time for play 
See the bills got to get paid 

We gotta eat everyday 
And nothing in life comes for free 
So go ahead and get what you can 
I got your back, baby, be a man 

I understand 
All that it takes 
Do what you can 
Before it's too late 

Honey I'll always 
Be around 
I'll pick you up 
If ever you're down 

Go and get your paper, babe 
You won't hear nothing out of me 
Honey ain't no time for play 
See the bills got to get paid 

We gotta eat everyday 
And nothing in life comes for free 
So go ahead and get what you can 
I got your back, baby, be a man
