Hey yeah yeah 
Mmm, hmm 
Yeah 

I know it's unbelievable 
That we've come to an end 
In spite of all that we've been through 
I hope we'll still be friends 
It's hard to think of losing you 
But everything has changed 
Except the love I feel for you 
That much remains the same 

All the roads that we travelled 
Are moving apart 
And although it hurts me so 
To let you go 
It's time for you to start 
To follow your dreams 
While I follow mine 
I guess it's time for us to say goodbye 
Don't cry 

1 -	Don't cry for me 
	Although I know we love each other 
	We're just no good for one another 
	Don't cry for me 
	Baby, it's gonna be 
	It's gonna be alright 

It's gonna, it's gonna 
It's gonna be alright, yeah yeah 
It's gonna, it's gonna 
It's gonna be alright, babe 

For everytime I think of you 
A tear comes to my eye 
I always thought I'd be with you 
Until the day I die 
If together we were meant to be 
You know that time will show 
But now we'll set each other free 
We need some time to grow 

Oh, we gotta move on 
And leave the past behind 
And although it hurts me so 
To let you go 
We're running out of time 
We only live once 
So let's take this chance 
To find out destiny 
And maybe then we'll see 
Don't cry 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 

It's gonna, it's gonna 
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna, it's gonna 
It's gonna be alright 
Don't cry 
It's gonna, it's gonna 
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna, it's gonna 
It's gonna be alright...
