No no no no 
No no no no no 
No no no no 
No no no no no 

All day, all night 
All day, all night 

[Cassandra] 
You used to be someone I could hold 
You used to be somebody I could talk to 
But now everything has gone wrong 
Why the hell do you expect me to sweat you 

[Charisse] 
Everytime I ask you 
You up and walk away 
Drama is all you bring me 
That's why I gotta say parlay 

Chorus 

All day, all night 
I need a man who's gonna do me right 
All day, all night 
That's the kind of man I need in my life 

[Cassandra] 
You used to take me out on the town with you 
And kept your arms wrapped around me 
Now everytime I turn around, I'm beggin' you 
But damnit you're too blind to see 

[Charisse] 
Everytime I page ya everytime 
You never return my calls 
Now I know why I'm leavin' 
Cause you don't give me your all 

Chorus 

All day, all night 
I need a man who's gonna do me right 
All day, all night 
That's the kind of man I need in my life 
All day, all night 
I need a man who's gonna do me right 

Nah nah nah 
Nah nah nah nah nah 

No more strokin' up and down 
You're too busy 
Foolin' Around 
No more strokin' up and down 
You must be zonin' boy 

Chorus 

All day, all night 
All day, all night 
All day, all night 
All day, all night
