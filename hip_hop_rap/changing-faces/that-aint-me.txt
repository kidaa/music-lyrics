How many times 
Did she let you down 
You came to me when she 
Was nowhere to be found 
She would apologize 
And you'd let her in 

How many times 
When you were together 
And you'd catch her on the phone 
Tellin you he was just a friend 
When will you realize 
That it just ain't right 

1 I will never leave you by yourself 
Turn my back on you for someone else 
She may have done those things 
But that ain't me 

I will never leave you all alone no 
Turn away from where I belong 
Although she let you down 
That ain't me baby 

Where was she when 
You needed her to be 
By your side with your family 
She embarassed you 
In front of them oh 

Where was your girl 
You loved so much 
When you needed just a touch 
Someone who loves you in return 
Why don't you see 
I will be all you need 

Repeat 1 

Everytime you're with me 
I treat you like you should be treated 
Never let you down 
Ill always love you 
Everytime you feel alone 
You call me on the phone 
And one thing I know for sure 
Ill always love you 

Baby baby 
Do do do do do do 
Ooh 
That aint me 
All you own 
Your cars and your home 
Own me 
Never let you down no no 
No 

I will never leave you by yourself 
That aint me 
I will never leave you all alone no 
Although she let you down 
That aint me baby 

Repeat 1 to fade
