From Dr. Dolittle Soundtrack 

[Featuring Ivan Matias] 
See the birds as they fly away 
Making htings for another day 
And the hearts of the lonely ones 
Found in you they can trust 
There goes the light again 
But the light you saved 
Left them dim 
And they will never forget the love 
That you shared with it 
Oh I, don't mind having your attention 
And I hope in time 
That the whole world will listen 
*Do little things today, do little things to do 
Do little things 'cause I know what it means to you 2x 
Ivan Matias 
See the glow on your face 
It's a reform no one can take away 
And the joy that runs through me 
Is so free 
I love being apart 
Even if the smallest heart 
Let's me in 
I wanna friendship that will never, never, never end 
That's why I... 
*Do little things today, do little things to do 
Do little things 'cause I know what it means to you
