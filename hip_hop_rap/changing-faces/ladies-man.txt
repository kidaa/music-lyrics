[Intro] 
Hey, hey, yo, is this thing on? 
Oh, for a second there 
I thought that I was the only 
Whose man put his car before his girl 
Put his friends before the relationship 
But I guess these are the things 
We just gotta deal with, huh 

Stood me up for the thousandth time 
Said he was running 'round 
He was crazy busy at the studio 
I wanted to key his car, cut his clothes 
I wanted him to die 
But then he slipped in for a second 
And he hit it and he made it alright 
Oh, yeah, yeah 

He's a ladies man, a playboy 
Smooth talkin', ooh doe, trickin' ho 
Pimpin', gotta go, gotta roll tight 
Was the same excuse 
Used every trick in the book 
Game no good, shoo 
But I love this man 

He's a ladies man, a playboy 
Smooth talkin', ooh doe, trickin' ho 
Pimpin', gotta go, gotta roll tight 
Was the same excuse 
Used every trick in the book 
Game no good, shoo 
But I love this man 

Any girl would come and say that I'm a fool 
Girl don't trip, cuz you know 
That it done happened to you 
You done ran into a guy 
That had your head all messed up 
Got you comin' out your clothes 
Talkin' you out your drawers 
And then never fall in love 

He's a ladies man, a playboy 
Smooth talkin', ooh doe, trickin' ho 
Pimpin', gotta go, gotta roll tight 
Was the same excuse 
Used every trick in the book 
Game no good, shoo 
But I love this man 

He's a ladies man, a playboy 
Smooth talkin', ooh doe, trickin' ho 
Pimpin', gotta go, gotta roll tight 
Was the same excuse 
Used every trick in the book 
Game no good, shoo 
But I love this man 

I know he got another girl 
I know he got another girl 
Know he ain't always at work 
Not at work, ain't at work 
I know he really got the pay 
He was workin' studio 
I know about the games he play 
I done played those before 

I ain't one who didn't know 
Sometimes you gotta play the role 
Never made me feel like I'm a ho 
But he made me feel like I'm all woman 

He's a ladies man, a playboy 
Smooth talkin', ooh doe, trickin' ho 
Pimpin', gotta go, gotta roll tight 
Was the same excuse 
Used every trick in the book 
Game no good, shoo 
But I love this man
