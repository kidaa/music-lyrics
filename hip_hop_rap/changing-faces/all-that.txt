You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 
You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 
You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 
You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 

Mmmmm 

[Cassandra] 
When I first met you 
I knew were the one 
You brought me so much joy 
I finally saw the sun 
Where did you get that heart 
It's wider then the sea 
Now we will never part 
Cause you're stuck here with me 

Chorus 

Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 
Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 

Oooooooh 

[Charisse] 
Comfort that you get 
I won't find no where else 
And you showed me how to love 
And most of all my self 
Now where did you come from 
It had to be the stars 
Cause there is no one else 
That I'll let in my hea-rt 

Chorus 

Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 
Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 

[Cassandra] 
There comes a time 
When you settle down 
And you lookin' for love 
There's no one around 

[Charisse] 
Once in a lifetime 
You'll find true love 
And when it feels good 
Don't let it go no no 

You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 
You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 
You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 
You're love is all that 
But mine is much better 
What what what 

Chorus 

Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 
Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 

Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 
Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 

Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so 
Your love is all that 
You need to know 
Your love is all that 
I'll tell ya so
