[Jay-Z] 
Changing Faces, Jay-Z, R. Kelly 
Yeah, check her 
Uh huh, Changing faces 
How we do 

Yo, all of my rhymes fall 
All of my days I trade 
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade 
Killing late nights cruisin' 
All you see is the brake lights, and hair blowin 
You know where we goin' 

Or at the club in the rear frontin' 
Poppin' droppin' 
And E amounts some cats will wear 
Ain't trying to hear nothin' 
Probaby was wilder than Bobbie 
Are you the Whitney to get me 
Hold me down and make me slow down be be twizzy 

Keep the ice out the club lights changing faces 
Get a little wifey on the license plates 
Wait, make me think about you even when you not around 
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down 
Cop you some sprinkles that hand with the wrinkles 
If preferred his and her firs to the ankles 
Keep your friends buggin', lovin' all my ways 
Jigger, keep you jiggy 
All of my days 

[Changing Faces] 
In the middle of the night 
You got me thinking 'bout you, babe 
Got me dreaming 'bout you, baby 

1 - All that I have All that I have 
Baby, it's yours Baby it's yours 
Forever and ever, baby 

2 - All I want is All I want 
To be with you 
All of my days 
All I want, all I need 

All I want is All I want 
To be with you 
All of my days All I want, yeah 

Anything to turn you on 
I'll be giving it to you, babe 
You don't have to worry, baby 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 

3 - All I want is 
To be with you all of my days 
All I want, yeah, hey 

[R. Kelly] 
Check it 
All I want, all I need 
Is you in my life 
Loving me 

All I want, all I need 
Is you in my life uh huh 
Loving me 

[Jay-Z] 
Now we going house shoppin 
Everybody wanna know the price your spouse droppin' 
Keep that on the low R.Kelly style 
It's quite shockin' 
A year ago, all I did was spend nights hoppin' 
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockins' 
Who woulda thought I'd walk down the isle, rice dropping 
Gotchu a nice rock and 
Now it's on they poppin', droppin' 
Hotter than platinum bracelets 
Jigger R. Kelly, Changing Faces, uh 

[Changing Faces] 
All I want is 
To be with you all of my days 
All I want, all I need 

Repeat 3 until fade
