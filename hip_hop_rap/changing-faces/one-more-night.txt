One more night 
One more night 
One more night 

I've been trying oh so long 
To let you know 
Let you know how I feel, mm 
If I stumble, if I fall 
Just help me back 
So I can make you see 
Please give me... 

1 -	One more night 
	Give me just one more night 
	Oh, one more night 
	Cuz I can't wait forever 
	One more night 
	One more night 
	Oh, one more night 
	Cuz I can't wait forever 

I've been sitting here so long, wasting time 
Just staring at the phone 
And I was wondering should I call you 
Then I thought 
Maybe you're not alone 
Give me... 

Repeat 1 

One more night 
Give me just one more night 
Oh, one more night 
Cuz I can't wait forever 

Like a river to the sea 
I will always be with you 
And if you should sail away 
I will follow you, you yeah 

I know there'll never be a time 
When we feel the same 
And I know it's only words 
But if, if you change your mind 
You know that I'll be here 
And maybe, maybe we both can learn 
Oh, give me, just give me one.. 

Repeat 1
