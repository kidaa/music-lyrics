[Intro]
How you doin'? 
We need to talk 
There's been something on my mind 
For a little while now 
Can ya dig it? 
Well, I'ma get right on down to the point 
Listen 
Mmm, yeah 

From the day we met 
No one believed in you and me 
Tension seemed to be as thick as molasses 
We keep it into our territory 
Our business, our happiness 
Our fuss and fights 
They had no right 
To tamper with our lives 

Now all of a sudden 
Things is made to change 
I guess you can say for the better 
If you can remember my name 
They call me a bitch 
That's who I tend to be 
My confidenciality is broken 
And disrespectin' me 
So go on... 

Go on with your rumors 
Go on with your friends 
You ain't never been strong enough 
To deal with a real bitch 
This has got to end 

So quick to speak what they don't know 
Talkin' shit about me 
Lookin' from the outside in, I can't win 
Them against me, against you, against me 
I'm just tryin' to hold it down 
But it wasn't true love that I found 
Cuz a real man can handle this 
Between you and me, who's really the bitch? 

Never cease to hurt me 
Callin' me out my name 
Blamin' your confusions on me 
You know it's a shame 
Stop feelin' yourself and open up your eyes 
Cuz you're makin' me hate you 
Your fine ways I despise 
Go on 

Go on with your rumors 
Go on with your friends 
You ain't never been strong enough 
To deal with a real bitch 
This has got to end 

Go on with your rumors 
Go on with your friends 
You ain't never been strong enough 
To deal with a real bitch 
This has got to end 

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
You liar, you low-down dirty son of a cheat 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
You're the worst kind of bitch 
Bitch that got the nerve to have a ho 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
You might as well go on with tricks 
Maybe then you'll earn some respect 
Maybe then you'll act like yourself 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
Maybe then you'll be what God wanted you to be, a man 

[acoustic guitar solo] 

You ain't never been strong enough 
Oh, won't you go on 

Go on with your rumors 
Go on with your friends 
You ain't never been strong enough 
To deal with a real bitch 
This has got to end 

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
If anybody out there know what I'm talkin' about, say yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
You don't want your man to be a bitch, say yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah...
