Introducing Brett 
You you want me to tell you 
I mean do you really want me to tell you 

Changing Faces 
What is it about you 
Just tell me how you do what you do to me 
Whatever you want to 
No questions asked you know it's okay with me 
You cant do nothing wrong 
You know just where to go how to play with me 
We can play all night long 
Cuz with you all night long is where I wanna be 

You got me doin things I never did before 
And when you touch me you open every door 
I'm not afraid to see how much you mean to me 
No I just cant explain what you're doin to me 

1 What are you doin to me Tell me 
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me 
What are you doin to me Tell me 
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me

What are you doin to me Tell me 
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me 

What are you 

Where did you go to school what you're doin to me 
How did you learn to do what you do to me 
The way you use your tools what you're doin to me 
See every touch you took had to get at me 
Sometimes I scream your name 
And I don't feel no way I don't feel no shame 
See all I feel is you 
So keep on makin me feel the way I do 

You know what it means you're my fantasy 
You put it on me never hold back give it to me 
I'm not afraid to see where you're takin me 
No I cant get enough of what you're doin 
you're doin to me
