God Is Here 
AHHHHH 
God Is Here 
Necronomicon is coming 
God Is Here 
EWWWWIEWWWDUDU 
God Is Here 
AHHHHHAUGH 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Mass Murdera Yeah 
Strangla Yeah 
Wig Splitta Whut 
Mangla Yeah 
Blood sucking vampire 
Dark Lotus 
King of Fire 

[Violent J:]
Swing off your ceiling fan 
Jump like an ape 
And stomp on your head 
Until it pops like a grape 

[Anybody Killa:]
Break ya neck if ya dissrespect 
Bullet holes in your chest with my brand new tech 
Dark Lotus in this bitch so you better beleive 
That we don't give a fuck if you're left to bleed 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Sitting on a tree branch like a crow 
I'll hawk your every move 
Dropping down on muthafuckas backs 
And twist they heads like screws 

[Violent J:]
Fuck you electric chair 
I don't care 
Bring it on bitch 
C'mon 
Crack an egg on my head 
I'll fry you an omelet 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Deep up in the woods naked 
I do my fire dance 
Around the pit I hop 
With my skull, drums, and voodoo chants 

[Jamie Madrox:]
It'll never take shape 
It'll only mutate 
See the fetus with a microphone 
3 arms, 2 brains, and only one leg only one leg 

[Violent J:]
Shoot me 
C'mon 
Blow a hole in my lung 
I'll lick out the hole 
When I swallow my tongue 

[Jamie Madrox:]
Left alone in a world 
Where hating men is the key 
You can tell a judge was recreating 
All that shit you see on TV 

[Anybody Killa:]
Pray for my soul you think it help 
Only wanna hit my 40 cause I'm trying to melt 
Hit you in ya backbone wich is deep 
Bodybag with a tag in the bottom of the creek 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Bullets percing through your skull 
Ram my fist into your jaw 
Retract my hand 
Release your teeth 
Yo chiclets falling to the street 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Pull your eyelids over your head 
Staple them to you skull 
Dump bleach into your eyes 
As I face fuck your girl 

[Chorus:]
This bread I eat 
This salt I swear 
As I inflate my self with prayer 
There is no grace 
There is no guilt 
This is the law 
Do what thy will 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
A cup full of chicken blood 
Three shapes of a monkey paw 
I'll have you cutting through your own arm 
Bone 
With a hacksaw 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Bone's exposed from the skin
Blood drips from innocence 
Pulling lungs up outta chest 
Leaving bodies where they rest 

[Anybody Killa:]
Where you gonna be when the sun goes down 
And six petals rise up from the ground 
Lotus Pod fully grown about to take you home 
To the land of smog where you're free to roam 

[Jamie Madrox:]
When we attack 
We attack like a swarm 
Punch you through your face 
Rip off your neck 
I play my rythm on your vocal chords 

[Violent J:]
I walk on your ceiling 
And drop thread in your mouth 
Let poisin drip down it 
And silently take you out 

[Jamie Madrox:]
One bee 
Protecting the hive 
We stay alive 
I'm on overdrive 
With my axe 
Will you survive 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
We'll conformulate a plan 
Reflex come and take control 
With my hand in broken glass 
And pull your heart out through you butthole 

[Violent J:]
My eyeballs are black 
My tears drip like oil 
I fuck holes in my yard 
And grow children from soil 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
The eyes of the dead 
They come back alive 
And wipe the air out your lungs 
Now I see through your eyes 

[Anybody Killa:]
Dark Carnivals in this bitch 
Waiting for he to come an start some shit 
Point blank with the heat cased at me 
Labeled a killa cause I bust a cap in anybody 

[Violent J:]
Scientists study me 
But they always quit 
Cause I eat through my butthole 
And talk nothing but shit 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Dark Lotus 
Devastation 
Murder without no premeditation 
Demons from beyond the earth 
Creeping on out the dirt 

[Chorus]

They always said it wouldn't last 
But we're still here though time has past 
Our souls were sent to spread the word 
And shine the light until done heard 

[Chorus repeats till end]
["Gods resurrection" also repeats till end]
