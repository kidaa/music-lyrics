[Anybody Killa]
I can see the Earth startin' to shift
Inside out
No trace of the moon
since the face burnt out
Watch the rain fall down,
hard and heavy
Dark black like dirt
but it will burn severely
You can call it the body of the Lotus
Hand of the magical supernatural keeping you focused
If the rain didn't get ya
then your here for a reason
To spread the word to the world
That the pod is in season

[Monoxide Child]
You can hear the thunder clap
The full moon gleaming like the eyes of a cat
The Dark Lotus is back Bitch
And you can feel the ground pulsating
And all the haters start hating 
but its all been anticipated
And we been waitin' till the timing is right
To get to bombin' on you bitches who misguided the light
And anybody who don't get it, 
get the fuck out my sight
Bitch, I ain't explaining 
I'm just claimin' your life, Bitch!

[Chorus]
Black Raindrops keep falling down
You can tell there's something goin' on, take a look around
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
Arms spread to the Lotus Cross holdin' it down
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
And I don't know why...why?
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
And I may never know why..know why?

[Violent J]
I stick a running chainsaw blade all down your throat
And fuckin' outta ya ass, 
I cut ya body in half
I gotta be bloody
Leave somebody blood on my body
I need to be the bloodiest
of bloody bodies and hotties
I'm 'bout to murda for the Lotus
Black Rain it falls upon us
And I don't need normal therapy I know who I am
And I don't like a blade through your brain do ya KA BLAM!!

[Blaze]
I sit alone speakin' with the head of a raven
He sat there and told me why my life's worth savin'
So I shot him in the face
And then I shot myself
After he said they were trying to turn 
the Kingdom into Hell
I was appalled
Put his head in my burlap sack
and just then black rain hit me in the back
Ice cold rain drops that look like black blood
are falling all over the neighborhood here it comes now

[Chorus]
Black Raindrops keep falling down
You can tell there's something goin' on, take a look around
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
Arms spread to the Lotus Cross holdin' it down
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
And I don't know why...why?
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
And I may never know why..know why?

[Jamie Madrox]
A new age, a new time
Now that the planets are aligned
Imagine a Lotus sign
Imagine the broken minds
Just waitin' to be fixed
With the petals of the Lotus you can answer all that shit
We the unstoppable force
all you hate us of course
Armed with the fury in the Family is the power source
Makin' red clouds filled with black rain sowed up
Until they become too heavy immersed and I show up

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Maybe this stupid ass ain't heard
it's the pod lil' bitch and we back like a message bird
Lift ya chin, face to the sky is black rain
Palms out feel the sting and let your soul drain
We don't give a fuck, like it or not
Lotus up in the mirror shots
and all Juggalo spots
I put a stain in they little blade pieces
cuz when we out bitch, the black rain increases

[Chorus]
Black Raindrops keep falling down
You can tell there's something goin' on, take a look around
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
Arms spread to the Lotus Cross holdin' it down
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
And I don't know why...why?
These Black Raindrops keep falling down
And I may never know why..know why?

"Oh who I know this is part of my real life?"
"Oh who I know this is part of my real life?"
