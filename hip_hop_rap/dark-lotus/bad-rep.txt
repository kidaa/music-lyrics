[Monoxide Child:]
Everybody treats me like uh I'm the anti-christ 
They want to kill my momma for giving me the life 
I'm on my tree they say, I walk a different way 
Get on your knees and pray, Lotus it's your judgement day 
I like to hang with the hookers and whynos 
And let them give me tats with their heroine needles, whut 
I love to kiss on the bitches with bad breath 
And choke them by the neck while I just fuck her to death 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Now tell me do you love me, or do you love me not Naww 
Well kiss my ass, the red dot marks the spot 
Tell me, how you be behind my back and always hate 
To my face we straight, about to make me catch a murder case 
Tell me, what make your brain tick What the fuck 
To even find the Lotus clique, well you gotta look 
But you can't see us, well try focal heat specs 
Matter of fact mother fuck you and my rep

[Violent J]
Come over here I wanna tell you a story 
It's an ugly one, it's about neden, and how I can't get none 
I could have cocaine cum with a crackpipe dick 
And I couldn't get a basehead to buff my shit 
Speaking of crackheads I am a crackhead 
I mean I don't smoke, but I gotta crack in my head 
My daddy used to slap my face around with a brick 
Until finally the back of my cranium split 
I took my shoelace off and sewed it back shut 
I wear this goofy wig now to hide the cut 
Look nobody loves me I'll be quick to admit it 
My momma says she loves me, but she won't let me hit it, I'm kidding 
Then you got my brothers they call me metal case 
They beat me up and put they cigarettes out on my face 
Ahhhh my head throbs 
I'm about to enroll in Columbine, and finish the fucking job!

"Hi Kelly, it's me J.
Listen I know you don't like me calling you and stuff, but fuck you.
You know what I mean
Gimme a chance, I'm not that stale. I mean just because..." 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Terrible thoughts run through my mind 
Causing my head to fill with anger 
Anybody I don't know I wanna strangle 
Does that make me such a bad guy Nope 
Y'all like live bitches, I like the dead kind 
Hang with killas, creep like phantoms in the darkness 
And even though we like to murder we ain't heartless 
Can't help it I got a bad reputation 
But devastation, all out panic before decapitation 

[Jamie Madrox]
Don't nobody love me, don't nobody care 
They'd rather sit and stare, and make fun of my hair 
I'ma killa, I'ma devil, I'ma punk, I'ma traitor 
My momma hate my guts, but I could never ever hate her 
And this bitch I used to fuck say my dick too small 
She wasn't sayin' that when she took it all in the jaw 
And all my dawgs and my true friends think I'm insane 
They say Jamie doesn't rationalize or talk in normal ways 

Everybody love me No

Just gimme a chance and call me back you know 
Just gimme five minutes 
Just gimme five fucking minutes 
Just quit sucking dicks like a fucking cunt bitch 
And call me back 
I'm asking for a second chance 
Everything I do is always my fault 
You're such a fucking slutty fucking whore! 
Call me back bitch!
