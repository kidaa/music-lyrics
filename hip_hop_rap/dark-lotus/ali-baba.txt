This is the Lotus 
The Underground 
Where all darkness meets 
For the judgement of their afterlife 
Six petals, One pod 
And an Army full of Juggalos 
Emerging from the center of the earth 
Willing and able to take control 
Of all unfinished situations 
By leading the outcasted souls 
To the power of Shangri-La 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Venomous snakes magically charmed 
All of disappear with the wave of a wand 
Pharaohs eternally rest in they tomb 
Hachets unleashed allow doom to consume 
Nomads wander were do they go 
Scholars go insane at the minds of Juggalos 
Sand grains burn when the sun beats down 
Skin rots more as the earth spins around 

[Anybody Killa:]
I got a handfull of dust 
From the leaf of the Lotus 
Hold it in the sky 
Blow it in the air to get my focus 
Cut off my fingertip 
I wanna see the blood drip 
Onto the tail of a possum 
Close my eyes make a wish 
On my knees praying to my Ali Baba! 
Can you hear me every time I scream an Holla! 
I'm just a killer with problems 
I want a fucking release 
Without the help of a therapist 
My family or a preist 

[Chorus x2]
Ya heh ya mesh 
Shaken the wilderness of Kadesh 
Ben laf kilpen the urges 
Unknown apocalypse of the seven churches 

[Violent J:]
Floating on a magic carpet with a fat sword 
It's Joe Bruce of the Lotus ward J Tneloiv 
You can try and rub my lamp 
I might float out and spike your ass like vamp 
I bow to the pyramid I do confide 
The secrets of the carnival are deep inside 
Disrespect it, foolish, hocus pokus 
I'll spilt your forehead and plant my Lotus 
You don't know what this killa's all about 
I might sever your head off and fuck your mouth 
Bells and chimes ring 17 times 
Faceless souls act out like mimes 
Pegasus cry as gargoyles take eyeballs from heads like skinless grapes 
Even kings will fall to their knees 
And end up only knowing one word, esaelp

[Chorus x2]
Ya heh ya mesh 
Shaken the wilderness of cadesh 
Ben laf peupen the urges 
Unknown apocalypse of the seven churches 

[Monoxide Child:]
Come with me to the legendary land of Ali Baba 
A place of genies and flying covers 
Would you wish for rub a lamp 
Take a chance 
In the land were the genies and the gypsies dance 
Magical realms are held high visions of wishes 
And I can see them all dieing cause the vision are viscous 
I'm a warlock wand waver vagabond 
Have you talking backwards I be abaB ilA 

[Jamie Madrox:]
Ali Ba.. Ali Baba 
Frog legs, eyes of a cat, teeth of a parona 
Scale of a fish 
A dream of a wish 
Sight be on sight you never picture this 
Talk in reverse then it shall appear 
["Hsem Abab Ila Em Llac" in background]
Standing in front of you with a smile ear to ear 
Summon called upon from world to world 
And he leaving with the souls of the boys and girls 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Welcome to the dead waste land 
Children of the damned 
Demon throw me out a sack 
To search throughout the whole profession 
Black magician 
For the equation 
Of warlock grain wishes 
Any thing your eye invisions 
Freaking you without admission 
Calling Ali Baba 
Hit me with the savior 
Pray to the father 
What makes you think he'll save ya 
Now your left to burn forever 
All the demons brought together 
Tear your body limb for limb 
Only demons call upon him

[Chorus]
Ya heh ya mesh 
Shaken the wilderness of cadesh 
Ben laf peupen the urges 
Unknown apocalypse of the seven churches 
The Lotus
