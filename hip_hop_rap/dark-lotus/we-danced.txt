[Violent J:]
It was a dark and stormy night,
when five children of the Lotus crept into a local cemetery,
their intentions were nothing more than to smoke marijoowana leafs
and drink acholic beverages.
But these five young boys were soon joined by some very unlikely company.
If fact, for the children of the Lotus,
this was some company that they could only dream of.
I'm talking about the dead. Not just any dead.
I'm talking about they were joined by 5 ravishing,
beautiful, lovely dead women who opened up to these boys
and gave them their all. 

[Jamie Madrox:]
Do you like the Ouija, we dance 
Blood, flesh, romance 
Right there, right in front of the tomb 
Beautiful, horrific, and the moon 
Dead flesh, crazy hormones 
Me with a hard dick 
Her with her neck broke 
We did the tango, she breathed 
She wiped blood on a killa's sleeve 
Now I ain't ever been one to pass 
She might be dead but she got a nice ass 
Riding to the bone, I like dead meat 
Wearing nothing but her panties 
Shaking to the beat 
So you like to dance 
Is that magic 
Is that your ass 
In back I'm grabbing 
You're getting kinda freaky 
Biting on my neck 
My heart is beating fast 
My underwear's wet 
And we danced... 

[Chorus:]
I can't believe we danced 
And I don't even dance 
I can't believe we danced 
And I don't even dance 

[Monoxide Child:]
Sitting with my thoughts by the Mausoleum 
I can't believe my eyes but I know I see them 
She walked up to me 
"Can I have this dance" 
And put her hand right into my pants 
She had a slit in her throat 
But I wasn't even tripping a bit 
But I was kinda bucking the bitch 
Missing her lip 
She had a long tongue 
Stuck it straight down my throat 
And when I went to grab her titty 
It just turned to smoke 
And the bitch's mouth started bleeding again 
I had to open up her cheeks so my dick'll fit in 
I love the blood and guts 
And all the sex with the dead 
I love the sluts with the snake coming out of they head 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Damn, was there something special in that 
When I swallowed it down 
It kinda pushed my wig back 
Fact wait, let me rub my eyes 
What I'm seeing right now 
Starting to make my pants rise 
Hello beauty queen 
Can I have this dance 
And when the song is over 
Can I see some romance 
So what 
You can see ya skull through your hair 
I only got one concern 
Pulling down ya underwear 
As I lick the skin across her hip 
I feel my tounge slip in into her rip 
A neden or a leg 
It don't matter to me 
Cause dancing through the cemetery gots me in ecstasy 
And we danced 

[Chorus]

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
My first thought when I seen her rise above the ground 
My one and only dead bitch had been found 
She was the high school prom queen 
Miss teen and shit 
Pressure was too tight 
She cut her wrist 
Her clothes a little tattered 
It ain't matter though 
All I wanna do is stick my dick in her jaw bone 
Spent about 10, frozen, decomposing 
Sweet talk the freak till I get them legs open 
Can't wait to get up in her decayed womb 
She's been untouched for 5 years 
In her tomb 
She rising up fo a killa 
To be the only one 
Magic dead fuck smell every time she cums 

[Violent:]
I was lonely 
I had no one 
Mind as well do masturbation 
I'll jack off while Shaggy smooches 
I'm watching them from the bushes 
Had my face down in my boodrest 
I felt something poking my ass 
It's another ghouly girly 
Look at me 
I'm naked early 
She came under me and mangled 
She had no feet 
Skin just dangled 
We went behind a tombstone 
And I said, "Your boobies, may I hold them" 
She lifted up her crusty sweater 
They were blue and stuck together 
Gently I peel them apart 
And her skin ripped open 
You could see her heart 
And we danced...

[Chorus repeats until song ends]
