[Violent J:]
I think it's funny how...the toughest criminals and thugs and whatever...
when they're on their death bed...
you know like the day before they fry in the electric chair...
all of a sudden they want to get religious. 
I heard that 9 out of 10 inmates on death row are all ultra religious. 
That's because they know they're about to die. 
That they are about the meet whatever's after death. 
It's funny...nobody wants to turn to god till it's too late. 
Till it's time for you to fuckin' die 

[Violent J:]
Baggin me 
Pain 
Suffering 
Bang Bang 
Chains 
Devices 
Torture things 
Is this hell 
Might as well be 
It's what's next and shit 
I live life filthy 
We sexed every bitch in the gutter 
Then we rob or mudda 
Find a shutta 
And shoot fo or fo each otha 
I blame it all on the people around me 
It's because of them god never found me 
Right wrong 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Before I hit the ground 
When I got three in the chest 
I should've guessed my time was over 
Should've worn the fucking vest 
But I wasn't thinking straight 
Caught up in the thug life 
Was the king on the streets 
Now I'm asking god to take my life 
To the pearly gates 
So I can rest peacefully 
But he wasn't helping me 
Why has he forsaken me 
To eternity in hell 
Left to rot in the grave 
And if it wasn't for the Lotus 
I'd still be there today 

[Chorus:]
Call upon your gods 
Beg for them to help you 
Call upon your gods 
Religion has left you 
Got a final hour 
Cross the final line 
Life will end 
But there is no end to time 
Call upon your gods 
Beg for them to help you 
Call upon your gods 
Religion has left you 
Got a final hour 
Cross the final line 
Life will end 
But there is no end to time 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Skin seperates from bone 
Seperates from bone 
One hot flash of metal 
Now your on this earth alone 
Laying face down in you're own blood 
With nowhere to turn 
Everything from your finger tips to toes burn 
Heat sets skin deep 
Open up your eyes 
The cold clutch of death's hand 
He could care less about your life 
As Hell's Chariots come to carry you away 
You finally realize 
It's to late to pray 

[Monoxide Child:]
Help me out 
I can't understand the way you think 
Or what you're talking about 
I see you sitting 
Perfect circles 
With disciples of Satan 
I got my shotgun cocked 
Newspapers and revelations 
Every bullet is a story 
They keep it glorified 
The media's the target 
And now they gots to die 
Son of Sam 
Sam of son 
Buck you with my shotgun 
Wicked work will be done 
Fuck it catch a hot one 

[Chorus]

[Jamie Madrox:]
There ain't no end in time 
You hear me hethan bitch boy 
Bite your devil tongue 
Before I stab you with this pitch fork 
All that shit you talk about 
"My God is ashamed" 
Crying in pain 
Calling his name 
Your such a hypocrite 
Low down inconsiderate 
Piece of shit 
And you ain't worth an ounce of spit 
Blasphemous 
Dissing my lord 
And clocked out 
Where's the tough guy 
That told my God to go and fuck himself 

[Anybody Killa:]
I called apon my god 
He told me which path to take 
I just hope it's not another mistake 
Confused by the things that I'm feeling 
Guns that I carry, hoes that I'm drilling 
Tell me is this just another fucked situation 
Calling on my God cause he's the cause of all creation 
Never was told things would be like this 
Always visioned that my life would be filled with happiness 
What 

[Chorus]
