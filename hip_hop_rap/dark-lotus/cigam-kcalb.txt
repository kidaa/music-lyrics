[Chorus:]
Blackest magic, leave my soul, give my angels all control 
Blackest magic, let me be, keep your black tounge off of me 
Blackest magic, drop your chain, may you never speak my name 
Blackest magic, watch you cower, bite your tongue and holy power 
Why why when people witness magic, they'll ignore it and say it never happened 
Only thing they'll beleive is whats tragic, god throws it nobody wanna catch it... 

[Verse 2:]
I go east, you go west, and the moon follows both of us, it's magic, magic 
Pyramids, circle crops, hunded tonne stone hedge crops, it's magic, magic 
Volcanic lava, earthquakes, weather causes aches, its magic, magic 
Music love, the unseen drug, fucking lightning bugs, it's magic, magic 
Hypnosis, ESP, mental telepathy, it's magic, magic 
Amityville, northern lights, blood red moon lit nights, it's magic, magic 
Rings of saturn, the black hole, mind over body controll, it's magic, magic 
Exorcisms, Mary's crying, unknown objects flying it's magic, magic 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Frozen fire 
Call me down 
Frozen fire 
Show me around, 
Candle wax drip like tears 
Roll over one thousand years 
Monkey blood 
Sweet and hot 
Take me to my spot, kay 
Wait, devil has my tounge, 
Heaven's bells have now rung
