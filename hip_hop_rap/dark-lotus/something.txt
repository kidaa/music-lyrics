[Violent J:]
Scariness 
Your butthole just spit in your pants 
Scariness 
What's scary, is not knowing what, what is 
Something scary 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
When I start to think 
My skulls begins to crack 
Could it be the infection in my head 
Trying to get me back 
Cause the more I look at myself 
The more...fuck I don't know 
The more I think about it 
I think my fucking head's gonna explode 

[Monoxide Child:]
Wigs splitting 
Leaving all your family members dead 
I can't explain it 
So I just blame it all on my head 
Paranoid 
Shaking in closets when I'm done 
I think I'm hiding from the fact 
That I just slaughtered everyone 

[Jamie Madrox:]
I wash my hands so many times 
That they crack and bleed 
But water purifies 
Washes away 
And makes me clean 
My soul is so dirty 
I tried to wash it too 
And get something together 
To figure out what to do 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
The voices in my head keep driving me crazy 
Got my glock cocked 
And loaded with no safety 
Itchy trigger finger and I'm ready to release 
Something keeps telling me 
To increase the deceased 

[Chorus x2:]
Something's talking in my head 
I can't help thinking it hates me 
Something's telling me I'm dead 
It's going to cripple and rape me 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Peering through a window 
I think I'm falling for this chick 
Cause when I look down 
Somehow I'm dry fucking a brick 
Why is it when she sees me 
She's gotta SCREAM! 
Now I gotta jump through the window 
And gag her with my stiffy again 

[Monoxide Child:]
I just wanna split my neck and back in half 
When the reaper comes to get me 
I'ma even go a kill his punk ass 
Post modern vibrator 
Scaly, like an alligator 
Bitch you dieing now 
Cause you ain't even seeing later 

[Jamie Madrox:]
I was raised in a way 
That corrupted my mind 
I watch my family abuse each other 
At the drop of a dime 
It fucked my head up 
And I can't think straight 
Who can I confide 
Who can I trust 
Who can relate 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Something still telling me 
To put you on the ground 
And dump you in the river 
So your body never found 
Then go home and call the cops 
Tell them what I did 
And when them suckas show up 
MURDER ON THE PIGS! 

[Chorus x2]

[Violent J:]
That dog is talking to me 
Dude there dogs, they don't do that, do they 
That dog is scaring me 
[hiss 6x]
That dog is talking to me 
Dude there dogs, they don't do that, do they 
That dog is scaring me 
[hiss 5x] MURDER 
I'm sexy 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Shut the FUCK up, bitch 
Quit telling me what to do 
Blaze, J, Mono, Madrox 
Is that you 
No, it can't be 
It's me standing alone in the rain 
FUCK THIS BULLSHIT! AND THE PAIN! 

[Jamie Madrox:]
You say that I'm different 
And not a normal man 
You can say you hear me 
But really just don't understand 
Trying to explain 
I like to yell when I explain 
So you can understand 
How it feels to be in pain 

[Chorus till end]
