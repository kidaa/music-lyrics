[Jamie Madrox:]
Bitch I'm the sexiest killa you know 
Come equiped with an axe and some love handles 
Vampire out of the water, straight to land 
Can a killa that you know fuck you better than I can 
If you say that they could bitch, you's a lie 
You must of never had a juggalo between your thighs 
Didn't like the fat kid that was cutting your lawn 
Now your giving head shots for your favorite song 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
So bitch you think I'm se-xy 
And you want my wi-lly 
Then you best expect me 
To slap you in your fu-cking mouth 
Oh that's right bitch you like killas in disguise 
Sure I'll fuck, but don't expect to loose a lot 
I'll make sweet love to the neden of a juggalette 
A fake bitch out for props gets her neck wet 

[Chorus:]
Baby am I se-xy 
Tell me am I se-xy 
Baby am I se-xy 
Tell me am I se-xy 
Baby am I se-xy 
Tell me am I se-xy 
Baby am I se-xy 
Tell me am I se-xy 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
What up young bitch, I know you like dick 
Drop to your knees and tell me what you think 
As my dick slides up, in and out your face 
11 years dead punk bitch fuck bitch how it taste 
Lay your ass down and close your eyes 
Imagine dead dick between your thighs 
Can't nobody do it quite like this 
I might be dead but I'm sexy bitch! 

[Monoxide Child:]
Bitch I can't front, in the days of no pain 
I still had the game to put your face on fame 
Monox' boogy in this bitch with my dick all hard 
Face fucking all you hoes be my only truck card 
Bitch, you can kick it with the punk next door 
But when you see me, ain't no talking cause we be fucking on the floor 
And all the fronting shit gots to go 
I'm on the hunt for that freak nasty bitch from head to toe 

[Chorus]

[Violent J:]
Bitch ain't I sexy 
Wanna take a ride in my lexi 
Well I ain't got a lexi 
I got a taxi 
Get the fuck in it 
Floor it and pay for it 
Bitch we the Dark Lotus six 
We don't like richie ass groupy chicks 
I never got neden before I was famous 
Bounce, or get my foot your anus 
Bitch you think it's all song and dance 
I'm a bust your head if you don't come out of those pants 
You don't get to chose us or take your pick 
You'll be lucky if you get to suck squezy dick 
Bitch I'm sexy take off my shirt 
What's that all on my back, dirt 
Don, down and dirty be the Violent J 
And the motherfucking lotus pod be the hide away 
Bitch show a juggalette respect 
You don't wanna tussle with a down ninjette 
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money 
And I ain't got either one, so get the fuck on 

[Chorus]

That's right look at this bullshit 
Cause that's just what it is, bulllll.......shit bitch! 
You better suck my dick till my balls get wet 

Hey yo Marz, 
You never was Lotus and you know this bitch!!
