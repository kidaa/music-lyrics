[woman crying]
Oh my god 
[still crying]
Don't leave me 

[Monoxide Child:]
I can here them whisper my name 
I can feel them watch me every now and again 
I watch him float along the clouds 
Hunt for blood stains 
My souls almost out 
And he can only see the pain 
Wings spread on a porch I sit 
Conversatin with the devil on some shit 
I feel the spirts rise 
When the black birds fly 
When its time to die 
Only the crows know why 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
12 o' clock on the dot 
My blood runs cold 
On my window 
Got me in a choke hold 
Visions of death pinicle sacrafice 
And the ultimate price of taking my own life 
Beady yellow eyes see right through me 
Talking to me, the beyond consumes me 
The black crow takes my thoughts 
And plants seeds 
The black crow plants his feet and over sees 

[Chorus:]
Our father of Shangri-La 
Halo be thy name 
If the world turns over 
Save me from the fire rain 
Keep me pure keep me clean 
As the Lotus grows 
I ask ye for forgiveness 
Keep me from the crows 

[Jamie Madrox:]
Balck feathers black eyes black wings 
Perched atop the cemetery gateing 
Waiting for me, recording my moves 
Used to be one, now there are two 
A couple waiting to pick at my soul 
And bring me back to the one in control 
The faster I run they still give chase 
Will they leave me if I reveal my Holy Cross face 

[Violent J:]
Black blood within the raven 
Have I been forgaven 
A haven of crows watching skwaking 
Drifting above me, hawking 
What lies beneath it's eyes 
Who's guideing it as it flys 
When the red moon bleeds 
It feeds, forfilling it's needs 

[Chorus x2]

[Monoxide Child:]
In my mark for death 
Do they want my last breath 
Do they really want me dead 
So my soul will reserrect 
I can't help it praying to the god above 
Purify change the crows to doves 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Wings spread out and they cover my soul 
Deaths voice springs out 
And spreads threw my mentals 
In threw my mind 
And down my spine 

[Violent J:]
Midnight, sunrise, sunfall 
Crows beckon, pharohs call 
My blood hot dripping 
Growing clipping, snipping 

[Jamie Madrox:]
I will never be afraid 
Of the eyes of the dead 
In my trench coat pocket 
There's a severed crows head 
I look down his neck 
To see what he can see 
I've finally come to grips 
They will always be around me 

[Chorus x2]
