[Monoxide Child:]
Now that I'm dead and gone 
Look at me 
I'm floating like the breeze 
With my roots strong like trees 
I'm filtered in your memories 
Holding a candle light vigil 
Saying a prayer 
My name is graced 
Buried with the paint on my face 
I put the chase up long enough 
I live the lifestyle wrong and tough 
And now my life span's up 
I give a fuck 
I'm about to run it in the after life 
And hopefully they put my soul in the butcher knife 

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
If I was to die 
It'd make a lot of people happy 
No funeral possesions 
No plot at the cemetery 
Finally 
I can be alone in my own world 
The wagons come take me away from the killing fields 
If I was to die 
Would you finally shut your mouth 
Understand what I am 
Understand what I'm about 
Like curse 
Place me up high on your pedastil 
I'm about to find out 
SHAGGY IT'S TIME TO GO 

[Chorus x2:]
I wanna die 
So I can see the otherside 
I wanna die 
So I can fly Take Me With You 
I wanna die 
Take me to the otherside 
I wanna die 
So I can fly Take Me Away 

[Violent J:]
I wanna die 
Maybe I'll get angel wings 
So I can cut them off 
Cook them up 
I have some helly wing dings 
I'd take my hallo off 
Get myself a ladder 
Hang it on the wall 
Maybe you'll think it's a gold record 
Death 
Everybody follow my hearse 
Why does everybody always gotta go and die first 
Before their homies are missing them 
Family members kissing them 
Everybody even enemies stop dissing them 
I want to die 
So I can haunt my buddies 
Stand behind them in the mirror with my eyes all bloody 
Stick my long, black, cold tongue all in the ear 
And be like, "I'm only playing" 
And disappear 
I wanna die 
And have everything answered 
What happened to my father 
Why was I a bastard 
What is thunder 
Is it really God bowling 
And nightime's a blanket 
And all the stars are the holes in it 

[Chorus x2]
Jamie Madrox: 
Your answers are unneccesary 
You understand 
Never question the emotions 
Of an unstable man 
I got the petals of the Lotus 
And the pedal to the floor 
Following a black hearse 
In the rain through a thunder storm 
Never once did I invision 
Me being stuck in such a situation 
He made decisions 
And now his spirit levitating 
I can see him waving at me 
Through the window of the hearse 
He's crying blood 
It all stops and it gets worst 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Ashes to ashes 
Dust to dust 
At least that's what I was told 
When I was on the come up 
Been to the grave and it ain't no joke 
Resurfaced to the earth with the spirits I envoke 
Cut down in my prime 
When my block got hit 
Now I'm riding in the back of a hearse and shit 
Darkness, pitch black 
Never seeing no one 
And the devil got his darkest demons 
Riding shotgun 

[Chorus x2]

Take me away 
Take me with you 
Take me away 
Take me with you 
Take me away [echo]
