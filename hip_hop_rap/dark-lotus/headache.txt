[Monoxide Child:]
I hear the words are spoken 
I think my mind is broken 
I keep on steady smoken 
Hopefully I die from choken 
Know what I was just thinking 
Maybe if I keep drinking 
The voice will quit and I can escape from this demon deakin 
My lifes a living hell 
Only the voice can tell 
Oh please oh christ compell 
Lead me from this evil spell 
My body won't stop shaking 
These voices keep on making 
Me do things to people, this must just be the work of satan 

[Jamie Madrox:]
They want my mind an soul this shit is way out of control 
I haven't been to sleep in weeks, i'm sweating but my body's cold 
I'm shaking like a leaf, terrified to go to sleep 
Puking from the medication my vitals signs are looking weak 
I see him in the mirror, he told me come inside 
He lives inside my head so there's no where to hide 
They want my soul to die so they can come alive 
Possess my body, so everybody can realize 

[Chorus:]
They say they'll give me pain 
They say they'll give me love 
They say they'll make me bleed 
And tell me i'm above 
They take me down again 
This is my medicine 
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you! 
They say they'll give me pain 
They say they'll give me love 
They say they'll make me bleed 
And tell me i'm above 
They take me down again 
This is my medicine 
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you! 

[Violent J:]
I take so many zoloft 
I bleed my nose off 
I run up in a church and rip my fucking clothes off 
The demon follows me right to the house of God 
But then it swallows me and takes me to the Lotus Pod 
What can I do when my brains shakes my earth quakes 
My lips crack, my skin dries up and flakes 
Sleepless, 6 days of weakness 
I pin eyelids open, with rusty paperclips 

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
The demons coming for me, they want to take my body 
Hands reaching up behind me sufficate the breath upon me 
They sqeaze my vocal chords until I want to scream 
Call upon the dark lord please wake me from my dream 
I'm steady popin no-doze, I never want to sleep 
Mental pressure over comes the brain, the evil creeps 
Body shakes for me uncontrol I need to pop another pill 
Demons here to take my soul to late I need a refill 

[Reverse Message:]
Spoken are the words 
In the hands of pythona 
Are the magic spells 
To unlock the keys to the universe 
It awaits, it will be summoned 
By the pedals of the lotus 
The night candles clean mind and soul 
Shall invoke the power 

[Chorus]

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
I sit alone in the closet so I can hear what they saying 
I'm rocking back and forth helpless will it, infest my ahhhh 
My momma told me it would pass its been 17 days 
The bag of the tynonel bottles don't say shit about a soul rape 
Tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do now how 
Act how now go where here be with who listen more to me or you 
Father tell me whenever will I be back to normal never 
I guess I'm cursed to live with this headache forever 

[Anybody Killa:]
I can't sleep at night 
Cause all these sounds in the darkness 
Wake up in a cold sweat 
Body feeling heartless 
Pop a couple sleeping pills to try an relax 
Every time I doze off something's breathing down my back 
Could it be the afterlife or just a soul living inside of me 
Praying for the day to take us both out of our misery 
Could it be the evil ways of past on friends 
Or maybe all the lives I took are coming back for they revenge 

[Chorus]

Give me pain 
Give me love 
Make me bleed 
Take me above 
Take me down 
This is my medicine 
I cut the head of the devil and I throw it at you!
