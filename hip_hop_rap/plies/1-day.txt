[Plies talkin]
Man i hope ya'll can excuse me for a lil minute man
Just sittin here thinkin bout my lil partner who just got killed man
Its wild dog how the motherfuckers you love the most
Seem like they the ones who always die first homie
Dog i just wish i had the oppurtunity to bring my nigga back for 1 day homie

Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away
Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away

God give me my nigga for 24 hours
So we can ride and laugh at these pussy ass cowards
Hit the liquor store,park,and then jus talk for hours
Show him half the niggas die when they lose they power
Nigga forget about you dog after they give you them flowers
Ol trifflin ass baby mama don got wilder
Now she fuckin the nigga you robbed wit da pink impala
But like i told you before dog dat hoe sour
You can fuck these hoes dog well gon house em
Bitch you aint got shit dog, money arouse em
After niggas dead and gone they lose thier value
Hoe'll cry at yo funeral and change right after

Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away
Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away

You first died, niggas sat around yo mama all day
But since your funeral them niggas aint went that fuckin way
Cause when you die yo dog suppose to step to da plate
You aint gotta worry , i got her,imma make sure she straight
Make you question if the love was real or was it fake
Out of sight,out of mind,guess its true what they say
When you was here them was the main niggas in ya face
Aint got to deal wit dem fuck niggas, you in a better place
I almost cried when i seen ya son da other day
You couldnt deny dat one boy, look like you all da way
I thought love was forever i guess dat aint the case
First you die,then they bury you,then niggas walk away

Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away
Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away

Im sittin right here homie, eyes full of tears
Never thought that pain last these many yrs
One thing i learned from all this shit,life real
Rep yo name till i die homie dats how i feel
Watched how everything changed since u got killed
Two days after you died niggas broke in ya crib
Niggas sayin yo lil cousin da one who stole yo wheels
This shit probably shouldnt fuck wit me, but it really is
You motherfuckaz showed me what shisty really is
Whats gon happen after i die?? one of my biggest fears
Seein what my partner don been through got me scared to live
I pray to God my life dont end like his

Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away
Wish i could bring my nigga back for 1 day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama don went a stray
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away
