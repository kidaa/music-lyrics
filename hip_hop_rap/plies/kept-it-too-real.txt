It's amazing to me homie 
that nigga's you fuck wit dawg
you don't know the truth about these niggas  
till yall fall out.  The more you show a nigga 
the more dangerous he become to you homie.

[Chorus]
I broke bread wit chu nigga showed you how I live
You talkin nigga but you dont understand 
what real is
When it came to you pussy ass nigga
I would of killed but it was my fault nigga I kept it too real

we busted choppers at niggas laid in bushes together
you had me fooled dawg I thought u was my fucking nigga 
would of did a 100 years for ya cause I fucks wit cha 
you told me what a good heart in these streets would get a nigga
not a muthafuckin thing but a sad picture
hurt me when I found out you had pussy in ya heart nigga
I never thought I would say this but mutha fuck a friend  
cuz ya dawg be the one that cross you in the end 
the shit I know now wish I had knew it back then
but going through it wit a fuck nigga is what make a man
I treat ya pussy ass better than I did my own kin 
when a nigga locked up or broke thats when they claim they love you then.

[Chorus X2]

what was mine was yours but what was yours wasnt mine  
if a nigga would of told me you was flow I would of thought he was lying 
but every nigga gonna show his hand in due time 
I kept it so muthafuckin real wit chu that I was blind
cuz I was to busy showing love I aint see the signs 
when you needed me pussy I came through every time  
whether u was right or wrong fuck nigga I was riding
but u envied me nigga in the back of yo mind  
you wasnt a hunter nigga you was real part time 
I broke you off nigga when them fuck niggas wouldnt give you a dime 
I aint owe you shit I just wanted to see you shine 
you never gave me shit I had my own grind and I aint need yo choppers nigga I had my own nine  
im a hunter nigga I done did me and yo time 
you cant trust ya own homies who the fuck can you trust 
I got more pride in my chopper so to me thats enough.

[Chorus 2X]

and God aint making you fuck niggas like he used to
a nigga Ill believe his hoe now before he believe you
and cuz u thug wit a nigga dont mean the love true 
it use to matter what you and yo niggas done been through  
nigga can be ya dawg one day and turn pussy out the blue 
a fuck nigga gone do what a fuck nigga gone do
better off running by yo self if you only knew 
dont mean that nigga a hunter cuz hell fucking shot
and money dont mean he real cuz he got loot 
if a nigga heart aint right no telling what hell do 
and real niggas extinct its only a fucking few 
cause 99% of these fuck niggas aint true

[Chorus]

aye my nigga I want to thank all the pussy ass niggas who I thought was real my niggas
niggas who I though was my muthafuckin homeboys nigga
I salute you pussy as niggas homie
cuz if it wasnt for you fuck niggas my nigga 
I still be showing love right now dawg
I still be walking through this muthafuckin blind my nigga
but its something that yall niggas taught me my nigga that
its ya homies my nigga  
that try you the muthafuckin most my nigga  
dem the niggas you cant let hold something dawg
and they feel like they aint never got to give it back
cause they ya muthafuckin dawg
dem the niggas who can be tied down and locked up my nigga
and you can take care of dem niggas for two three years my nigga
as soon as dem niggas get out dawg they go fuck wit the niggas
who aint never gave em nothing my nigga
go run back to the same hoe who ain't never did nothing for em while they was locked up homie 
I thank you niggas and salute you niggas my nigga
and wit all that said my nigga
I wanna tell you one thing for I go homie
God Bless You Pussy Ass Niggas
