[Chorus 2x]
I know you caught me cheating
and you tired of me lyin
Imma be honest with you baby
I know I crossed tha line
If you dont wanna fuck with me no mo than cool that fine
but before you go babe
Can we fuck one more time

[Verse 1]
I know I fucked up and sorry aint

shit and i kept it real i know that shit probably hard for you to swallow still I aint know how
