[Verse 1:]
Went to sleep real Woke up realer
Goon affiliated ex drug dealer
Resume solid Street cred bigger
Click full of soldiers All of us killers
Never seen one I'm what they call a real nigga
Pocket full of cash Body full of liquor
Put my whips on it Bet he ain't triller
If I don't know ya homie Hand on pistols

[Chorus:]
You lookin at da man
Stacks and rubber bands yup
Action for the cameras
You can ask the fans cause
They say I'm da man
Watch me pull my pants up
Watch me do my dance yup
Stacks and rubber bands yup
You lookin at da man
Whip bout 22's
Toating when I move
Askin what it do
You lookin at da man
Watch me pull my pants up
Watch me do my dance yup
Stacks and rubber bands yup

[Verse 2]
Key to the city Name carry weight
I don't fuck with niggas Most of em fake
You wet behind the ears jumped off the porch late
Where I'm from homie Home of the goons aid
Came up slow All off of shake
Grandma dyin Hard to be straight
Just left court My dog lost his case
They gave him life homie All for them 28

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Product of the hood Came from the gutta
Been through it all Still remain a hustla
Ride or die homie Before I fuckin struggle
Choppa game serious Got it from my brother
Learn the hard way Streets don't love ya
Snitchin at a high Dope game in trouble
Whip game shaky den you gone suffa
I'm da man homie Can't deny it sucka

[Chorus]
