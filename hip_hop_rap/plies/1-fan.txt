I like to salute u baby for recognizing swag 
You still a virgin if a goon ain't something you ever had 
Prefer mine out tha hood, but I respect class 
Glad you didn't let me scare you how my pants sag 
Guarantee off top, I'm better than your last 
Good girls I love 'em, I like to turn 'em bad 
One night I can make you forget all 'bout your past 
When it's over be able to teach your own class 
Opportunity of a life time, don't let it pass 
Longer we wait tha better, we got to move fast 
For it's over my name gon be on your car tag

Done seen a lot of things 
Done been all around the world 
But never once have I met somebody this bad girl 
I dont know if you a fan of mine 
But Im a fan of yours 
Cute face and a pretty smile and nice curves 
Couldn't even talk when I seen you 
I was at a loss for words 
Been your number one fan 
Ever since I seen you girl 
Fell victim for you when I seen your body twirl 
Couldn't sit back and wait 
Had to get to you first 
Let you play in my bank account 
To see you splurge 
All I can think about since I seen you is his and hers 
You've been promised it all in a line you ain't heard 
I'm your number one fan, 
I mean every word
