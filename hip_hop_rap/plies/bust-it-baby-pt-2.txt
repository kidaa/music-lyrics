[Verse 3: Plies]
I jus gave her a nickname, it's wet-wet,
Cause when we finish, she mess up all my bed set
She got sum to relax me when I'm under stress,
Neva told her, or let her kno, but she da best
She like to spell her name with her tounge on my chest,
If you wuda told me it was dis gud, I wud neva guessed
She full o surprises, I dont kno what shell do next
But while she sleep, I'll sneak and put hickes on her neck
And when she go, she shut down the hole set,
Love to see her in heels, with da slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair, get her own checks,
My BUSS IT BABY, I keep her on deck

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
She got me speedin in the fast lane,
Pedal to the floor mane, tryna get bak to her love...
Best believe she got that good thang,
She my lil hood thing, ask around they know us...
They kno that's my BUSS IT Baybayy...
Everybody know that's my BUSS IT Baybayy...
Everybody know that's my...
