[Plies talking:] 
Ay dog dis one here for all mutha fuckin niggaz dats locked up dog 
all my niggaz who biddn in prison my nigga a lot of niggaz

and dey main hoe done put a block on da phone

Wit done left em lone

[Verse 1:] 
What can a young nigga 19 do wit 40 yrs 
Not a muh'fuckin thang but hope for an appeal 
Dem crackas givin niggaz mo time den dey done lived 
Where im from deez crackas hidin niggaz at da crib 
I asked my homeboy how da fuck do you do 40 
He told me you just do it u dont think about it 
Dem crackas dont sell liq in prison u gotta think bout it 
but like he told me time aint tha thang hurts tha most 
The mu fuckas dat forget bout cha that u thought was close 
If he had to do it all again he woudnt even take it 2 da doe 
I told he aint got to tell me cuz I already know 
He thought he had hiself some soldiers on da front row 
Well like told him you aint breakin bread no mo 
N deez streets dawg dats all a bitch care 4 
Da real niggaz n deez streets are at an all time low 
And deez hoes and homeboys aint ridin no moe 

[Chorus x2] 

[Verse 2:] 
Nobody care about cha when u aint got shit to give 
But when ya got it they love ya while ya out of here 
They waz my niggaz when they waz out n they my niggaz now 
Right now they need me the most so I got to help em out 
I turn my back on em dat mean im da pussy nigga den

Tha fucked up part about dont nobody miss em 
Own brother cant even tell me where the crackas shipped em 
Told me that wit a straight face and kept dippin 
Im looking at dog like man dis pussy nigga trippin 
Ya own brotha ya cant tell me where tha crackas shipped em 
*Love* dont love nobody da streetz fucked up 
Dats why I pray everyday dat I don't get jammed up 
To b honest witcha im scared to find out wats wat

[Chorus x2] 

Wat happin to niggaz acceptin a couple phone calls 
and wat happin to niggaz sendin flicks to dey dawg 
Ya dawg down bad right now gone break em off 
Ya got to answer his calls for yall to even talk

Som niggaz doin time right now dat aint dey fault 
in dis world it's a black law n its a white law 
A street nigga dawg we don't die of old age 
A street nigga dawg we die 1 or three wayz 
We get shot, die in prison , or we die of aids 
I kno its already written how imma leave here one day 
But all da niggaz locked up I pray 4 ya every day 

[Chorus x2]
