Adding on, absolutely abolishing
Average amateur's arsenal just astonishing

Better bring a bomb to the battlefield
Bloody black beats bringing bottoms that boom
Basically build barriers bewilder buffoons

Crazy character, constantly creating concontions
Catalyst, a cannabalistic rhymes conqueror
Correctly connecting, craniums crumble down
Consistent capacity

Done did that done did this diddle don
Domination don't dignify diction
Doin' it deep down dialect daring
Doomsday dut devastate during the duration

Eons of energy, everyone affected
Efficiently epitomize excellent
Extravagant elevate where the essence is

Fabulous, furious, fatness, follow me

Verbal felon fired up federally foundation fadin' all of this wack shit
