Super fabulous the patterns have been uplifted 
Smoke a chalice with the maddest and the most spliffted
Turn the alphabet to calculus and flow swiftly
See the matter of the fact is that I'm so gifted
Due payer you do say-a 
Behead a terra formin in a toupee

I go hawaiian on an island in a phat tepee 
Then down in colin for some dining in a black three piece 
Im intertwining and aliging with a mack thesis 
The tongue of iron rule the lion of the rap species
I go abominable all up in you snow igloo

Super fabulous the patterns have been updated 
Wanna battle youll be baffled at the stuff stated 
Drowning in the shallow waters of the rough raging 
Verbal canoe with no paddle heading up state
I got a home made of chrome got an iron maiden
Etchin poems in the stone with a wire cable 
Im the lone wolf who dont condone violatin 
And when its on im leavin domes steady vibrating

Super fabulous the patterns have been upgraded 
Triple stamina commando get your hut raided 
Couldnt handle it you panicked and your luck faded 
Keep on yappin out your trap and ima duck tape it
See we been doing this since you was in a wet diaper 
Confusing as a rubix cube to the dense cipher
Intuitive just like confusious in your next life
Or a new addition of a ludricriuosly vexed sniper
Pursuin moving units influence the next writers
Student you ruin because you're truant before your test biter
Bloomin and movin on in unison 
Consuming the consumer 
And you and your crew'll be implented as 'west siders'

In come the fabulous ones make way for the fabulous ones [x4]
