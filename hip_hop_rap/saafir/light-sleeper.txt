I know I'm an emotionally disturbed
person
People think I'm talkin' to myself
when I'm 
Rehearsin' on the rhyme.  A mass
productionist,
a mass production matador, pan it
more to 
the left, there you go.  Minimize the 
Synthe-sizer wiser when I wind up for 
The pitch, but I don't pitch a bitch
'cause
Sales get derailed and towed an 
abundance
Of cash.  Damn, I let it go.  He was my man.
I tried to trust him, but I busted him 
twice 
In my trash can and I'm askin'.  I don't 
need
Psychology to see, the dichotomy in 
me.
Knew something was fishy, but I'm 
better than 
Wishy washy or topsy turvy.  It kinda
irked
Me that I caught him sleepin'
'cause I try
To be wide awake, but ye slows it
down
So I can't dilate and show that I'm 
bigger
Than that.  But I also have to consider
The fact that opposed to him not
being
The right peeper, I'm a light sleeper

So what does it mean when I reach
maturity
And still see that I'm not the mayor of 
my 
Mayonnaise, the master of my milieu.
At least I have a swing and a few
things 
On my mind, it's never a good nighty 
night
Just a rise 'n' shine.  Why's the rhyme
So important.  Why do I have to be so 
Potent and blow the mic a flow
without
Chokin' - I don't.  I'm arrogant and 
outspoken
Mouth no token I'm just a roust about.
I have a house and clout but I don't 
come tight
But it's routine since few fiend for true 
Hip-Hop.  It's a trip when I drop my style
and forget it and forget where I got it
from and how I got 'em sprung
'cause I'm
Stuck on myself and I depend on my
luck
And wealth for health matters so I 
don't
Explode with stress I'll serve you an 
elf
Platter they'll tell me my shit is fatter
Than the first but I'm a light sleepin' 
Rapper in a hearstI don't wear sarongs in my songs.
I diss
The skirts in verses an I used to 
measure
My demeters with clever panometers
but
I bounced like a pogo and I'm solo
with 
The hobos.  A nocturnal colonel in a 
journal
I put fly kids' eyelids to rest a detour
for Deep sleep when I freak beats I snap 
Like a defective contraceptive and my
sleep
Will be light, so you'll know that I'm 
tight
