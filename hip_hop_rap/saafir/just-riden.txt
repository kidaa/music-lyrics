Bored bored in my house it's time 4
Me to hit the streets and find me 
A freak without a bra unda her blouse
It's over straight through finished hey
you
Look like that nigga that played in 
menace
That's me but I'm not celebrity
stricken
They be choosen figuring I must be
oozing
With the bubbling doe they be sayin'
Oh! He look right plus his flow sound
Tight I don't know what he be talkin' 
About but it makes me upset but at
the same
Time it kinda makes me wet the game in
The rhyme tells me that he's a vet
It also tells me to get Met girl it pays
But she doesn't know I'll molest her 
days
Like sunrays don't play me ride to my shit
Baby.  Remove ya hands from ya 
draws no
Diggin' in designated areas it'll make
Me think ya itchin' for a bitchin' 
causin' me
To holler obscenities they be dissin' 
me, these
Swingers, dig in they're ass turn
around
And then smell they fingers
I caught one
No bullshit no joke that's why I had to 
stop
Hitten' Indo smoke cause I be flashin' 
on 
These ho's the type of shit I see on 
Summer days make me write but I 
never
Bite when I be riden'
Hoorodden wit my folks Jay-Z is
crazy
Straight soldiers in this shit to 
Leave his side you couldn't pay me
we be clownin' 
But won't get caught slippen' and 
sliden' slouchy
in the afterlife talkin' like they got me,
damn!
I don't wanna die so I ride wit my 
patna' one eye
One guy always be at me at the light
hollerin'
A bra I'll make ya windows tight faulty
Is what he be on that squeegee see,
I be
Seeing streaks and shit get the fuck
Away from my car I ain't got no
money
But I'm lying he smiled at me then 
Winked and flash me his diamond I 
Smobbed out the lot hit the corner
And peeped him on a plot I watched a
Nigga get got then around the corner
We come took off the wig and gave
me
The game the same sentiment came 
from 
His intent but it's irrelevant 'cause 
Game recognize game and I'm intelligent 
So save it up and out burnt rubber on
tha 
Pavement, the type of shit I see on 
summer 
Days makes me write but I never bite
