For it's Rashinel the antecdote to 
what's wack
Confirmed by my urban platoon
running past idle chatter
Leaning towards a means green trend
but I bend in the 
Opposite direction like an enormous
entity I'm incredible
But granted you can still see me
victim of my own imagination
Hobo Junction attach the name to 
greatness I escalate the 
Fat while most are just weightless
that eclipse the loss of 
Gravity coming from the inner starting 
at the bone cavity
Disrupting bone marrow worse than
the worst case of AIDS
I'm enclosed by the underground so I 
seek shade in caves
hard to surpass cement see we pave
the way soft limericks
Lure me to the streets of fury if a
nigga try to strike I'm like 
The devile always open for business to 
bring hell on earth
