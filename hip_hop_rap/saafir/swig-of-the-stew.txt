Another massive dose I'm sendin' in
Hittin' when I step back to the deck
Sidebets kick 'em in then raise up
Jet from the ivory it's time for me
To see if I can graze the cut
Just a hint I'm shuttin' down
ya pistons you'll have to listen
'Cause I'm clippin' of the wack
Bracket shit that's soft so go
Back to the troft and put it 
Back next to the Smirnoff bottle
Where u found it from it sounds
Numb has no feel an organic
Synthesis did I mention this in 
The last verse no I drive a fast
Hearse they'll have to catch the
Flow I'm snatchin' a row of burnt
Corpses and hopin' they lernt the 
Forces that they're up against the 
Immense in this shit will a
Fist to the grill instill a fraction
Of common sense you would want 
Providence to play a part but it's 
Obvious you have no heart I'm 
Protruding a pro-tracker the
Proportion of a slacker is where I 
store
The shit give me ya cup what's ya
Flavor it's juice taste it a swig of 
The stew

Now that I have a deepdish spoon 
Niggas be attackin' get blackin' 
Eyes like racoons blew up like
Balloons busted rusted they're 
Getting thrusted with them
Screw drivers who's the livest
Me and I love it when the 
Slug rubs another from a rusty 
Life they couldn't cut it so I cut
'Em with my trusty knife
Skinned alive and when deprived 
Of one's life one thinks twice
Three time a lady Lionel couldn't
Pay or you to fade me 'cause
I be learnin' shit makin'
Ternikits for broken English
I'm yokin' the seamstress 'cause
I'm sewin' up shit.  You know 
I can rip, I rest with the
Hobo's yo yo's stay up no 
Mayonnaise on the cut but I can 
Bust it wit the mustard my
Spice is hot the radish
Adds this seasoning that creates 
And make taste buds wanna make
dubs
Of a swig of the stewBox Car 23 is my freight train
I'm not strippin' for the cock except 
the Diesel the weight gain I make pain
and
I take it 'cause I'm humble a dirty rat
A sturdy gat is the back up for the 
Smack up easy for me to pack the 
knack
Up braggadocio rhymes I'm braggin' 
while
I'm laggin' saggin' 'cause my jeans
hafta
Be lean for the cuisine who dat!  Dick
Dasturdly could never master
Me drew raps after me comes me
stop
Suction cupping you got nothing 
coming 
But cum of burns hon.  I'm doin' it 
For my niggas in the oak-land where 
I plan my escape from traits of empty
Crates and busted grapes are not 
Part of the gomay hey just an 
Appetizer filet mignon but the song
is the stew
