We go do it like this
Yo, Yo, I'm the nigga you wish for
I'm the nigga dat ya meet in the rim store
from the first to tha tenth floor
baby I got it
From the minks in tha closet to the cars in the wallets
I know the trick, you can charge it
An i got keys to V's, you can start it
But if ya can't end it don't jump up in it
but if I hit it, I'll let you slide cause my windows tinted
Like my seats, we fleet yous and me between the sheets
some - times for weeks
where I live I preach
and ya know talk is cheap when ya walk wit heat
I keep my cubans wit my Jesus peace
Niggas mad cause I get more ass than wases
nigga face it, cause dat bitch wanna taste it
niggas hate it
you don't like us you just gotta face it
when my guns bust niggas know they can't take it
C'mon
Chorus:
