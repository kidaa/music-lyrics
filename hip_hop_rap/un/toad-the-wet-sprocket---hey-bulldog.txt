Sheep dog, standing in the rain  
Bullfrog, doing it again  
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles  
What makes you think you're something special when you smile  
Childlike, no one understands  
Jackknife in your sweaty hands  
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years  
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
If you're lonely you can talk to me  
Big man walking in the park  
Wigwam, frightened of the dark  
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you  
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
If you're lonely you can talk to me, hey  
Hey bulldog  
Hey bulldog  
Hey bulldog  
Hey bulldog
