And even my head, playing its part
It's not time
We can't get away with it
Even my heart, playing my head
Holding time
Just to get away with it
It don't matter what we think of
It don't matter what we try
I'd even lay my life down
Just to cross that line
It don't matter what I say to you
It don't matter if I cry
The silence of the evening
Sweet as suicide
And even my life
Couldn't suffice
It's not polite all right

And if I could lie to you
I'll deny it every time
Willingly apt to fall for you
Beginning to

It don't matter what we think of it
It don't matter what we try
I'd even lay my life down
Just to cross that line
Don't matter what I say to you
It don't matter if I cry
The silence of the evening the sweetest suicide

It don't matter what we think of it
It don't matter what we're tryin'
I'd even lay my life down
Just to cross the line
Don't matter what I say to you
It don't matter if I cry
The silence of the evening the sweetest suicide

It don't matter what I think of it
It don't matter what we try
I'd even lay my life down
Just to cross the line
It don't matter what I say to you
It don't matter if I cry
The silence of the evening the sweetest suicide
