written by: The Din Pedals  

Time and time against the wind  
I think, I feel  
With all your worthy peculiar friends  
With time to kill  

Now all your reasons  
Pushed, pulled, side tracked  
And your mouth  
These words start to gasp  
And in your head  
Feelings corked up and bottled  
You want to be adored  

Chorus: You might be  
You might fall  
You'll be a waterfall  
You might be  
You might fall  
Waterfall  

Mixed and confused  
Like a convict on the loose  
I think, I feel  
Well it's inevitable, it's inevitable  
I think I feel it too  

Now all your reasons  
Pushed, pulled, side tracked  
And your mouth  
These words start to gasp  
And in your head  
Feelings corked up and bottled  
You want to be adored  

Chorus  

Don't back down
