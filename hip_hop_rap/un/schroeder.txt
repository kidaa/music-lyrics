[LUCY]
D'ya know something, Schroeder?
I think the way you play the piano is nice.
D'ya know something else?
It's always been my dream
That I'd marry a man who plays the piano.

At parties he'd play something nice like
"April Showers."
I'm sure you could play something nice like
"April Showers."
Or even "Frere Jacques."
Beethoven's nice too.

Just imagine
What would you think if someday you and I should get married?
Wouldn't you like that if someday we two should get married?

My aunt Marion was right, never try to discuss marriage with a musician.
