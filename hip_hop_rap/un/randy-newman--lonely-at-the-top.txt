I've been around the world had my pick of any girl  
You'd think I'd be happy but I'm not 
Ev'rybody knows my name 
But it's just a crazy game oh, it's  lonely at the top 
Listen to the band, they're playing just for me 
Listen to the people paying just for me 
All the applause, all the parades 
Aand all the money I have made oh, it's  lonely at the top 

Listen all you fools out there 
Go on and love me, I don't care 
Oh, it's lonely at the top 
Oh, it's lonely at the top
