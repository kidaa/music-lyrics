Welcome home 
Your spirit's been here all along 
Like the ghost in the window 
Your song has been playing all along 
I really never was alone

Your face 
Look at this picture everyday 
You with your doubt, 
me with my big mouth

Welcome home, you never been gone for so long 
come home and be a mother to your son 
come home and be a mother to your son

Peace and love blessings from the one above 
everybody needs somebody somebody to love 
I steal... that line from Freddie cos he's already dead 
We miss you Fred 
See our troubles seens so pathetic 
We're tearing down the walls 
we build, brick by brick

Welcome home... 

It was an accident I lost control and off it went 
don't say you could get used to it 
because it means you'll keep on doing it...
