They like me. 
I think they're swell.
Isn't it remarkable
How things turn out so well?

Pleasant day, pretty sky
Life goes on, here I lie
Not bad, not bad at all.

Cozy home, board and bed
Sturdy roof beneath my head
Not bad, not bad at all.

Faithful friends
Always near me,
Bring me bones,
Scratch my ear

Little birds
Come to cheer me
Ev'ry day
Sitting here,
On my stomach
With their sharp little claws
Which are usually cold,
And occasionally painful,
And sometimes there are so many
That I can hardly stand it...

Rats!

I feel ev'ry now and then
That I gotta bite someone.
I know ev'ry now and then what I wanna be.
A fierce jungle animal crouched on the limb
Of a tree

La la la la la la la la la la la la la 

[SNOOPY]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
I'd stay very very still
Till I see a victim come.
I'd wait knowing very well ev'ry second counts.
And then like the fierce jungle creature I am
I would pounce!
I'd pounce!
I'd punce!
I'd-

You know, I never realized it was so far down to 
the ground from up here.

Let me see, where was I?
Oh, that's right, the pretty sky,
Not bad, not bad at all.

Cozy home, board and bed
Sturdy roof beneath my head
Not bad, not bad at all.
Not bad, not bad at all.

I wonder if it will snow tonight.
