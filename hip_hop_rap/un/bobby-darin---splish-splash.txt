Splish splish, I was takin' a batj 
Long about a Saturday night 
A rub-a-dub, just relaxin' in the tub 
Thinkin' everything was alright 
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor 
I wrapped the towel around me and I 
Opened the door, and then I 
Splish, splash... I jumped back in the bath. 
Well how was I to know there was a party going on? 

They was a-splishin' and a'splashin' 
Reelin' with the feelin', movin' and a'groovin' 
Rockin' and a'rollin', yeah 

Bing bang, I saw the whole gang 
Dancin' on my living room rug, yeah! 
Flip flop, they was donin' the bop 
All the teens had the dancin'  
But there was lollipop with a Peggy Sue 
Good Golly, Miss Mally was-a even there, too! 
A- well-a, splish splash, I forgot about the bath 
I went and put my dancin' shoes on, yay... 

I was a rollin' and a strollin', reelin' with the feelin', 
Moving and a groovin', splishin' and a splashin', yeah! 

Yes, I was a-splishin'' and a splashin'... 
I was a-rollin' and a-strollin'... 

Yeah, I was a-movin' and a-groovin' 
We was a-reelin' with the feelin' 
We was a-rollin' and a-strollin' 
Movin' with the groovin' splish splash, yeah!
