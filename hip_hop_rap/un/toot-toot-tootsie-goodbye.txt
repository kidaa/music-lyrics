GRACE: 
Toot, Toot, Tootsie goodbye, 
Toot, Toot, Tootsie don't cry.
The choo-choo train that takes me away from you, 
no words can tell how sad it makes me. 
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then 
I'll do it over again. 
Watch for the mail,
I'll never fail, 
if you don't get a letter 
then you'll know I'm in jail.
Toot, Toot, Tootsie don't cry, 
Toot, Toot, Tootsie goodbye!
