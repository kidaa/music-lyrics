Alright, now listen here now for the last time
You don't care for me

Gotta new fool ha
I like it like that

I have only one itchin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Hey

Oh listine here baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mum ain't home
It ain't my concern
Just play with me and you won't get burned

I have only one itching desire
Let me stand next to your fire
Yeah, let me stand baby
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh, let my stand

You try to gimmie your money
You better save it babe
Save it for your rainy day

I have only one a itchin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh, let me stand

Jimi:
Yeah, thank you very much. I'd like to do this song dedicated
To maybe a soldier in the army. singin' about his old lady that
He dreams about and humpin' a machine gun instead or it could be
Could be a cat maybe tryin' to fall in love with that girl baby,
But a little bit too scared. that's where the problems come from
Sometimes isn't it? I meen the cat is really insecure a little bit
So the call girls groupies and they call girls this. and they call
Passive people hippies and bla bla, woof, woof, all down the line
That's because their not in love man that's what's happening. that's
The other half of a man, is woman. and we'd like to play a thing called
Izabella, and don't you ever forget it.
