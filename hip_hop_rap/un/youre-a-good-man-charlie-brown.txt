[LINUS]
I really don't think you have anything
to worry about, Charlie Brown. After all, science 
has shown that a person's character isn't really
established until he's at least five years old.

[SALLY overlapping]
The only thing wrong with my big brother, 
Charlie Brown, is his lack of confidence; his 
inferiority and lack of confidence. His clumsiness,
his inferiority, his lack of confidence. His stupidity
his clumsiness, his inferiority and his lack of 
confidence, his...

[SCHROEDER overlapping]
Did you know that Charlie Brown has never pitched
a winning baseball game, never been able to keep
a kite in the air, never won a game of checkers and 
never successfully punted a football? Sometimes I
marvel at his consistency.

[LUCY overlapping]
Now Charlie Brown has what you call a 
Failure Face, Linus. Notice how it has failure
written all over it. Study it carefully. You rarely
see such a good example.

[CHARLIE BROWN overlapping]
Some days I wake up early to watch the sunrise, and
I think how beautiful it is, and how my life lies 
before me, and I get a very positive feeling about
things. Like this morning for instance; the sky's 
so clear and the sun's so bright. How can anything 
go wrong on a day like this?

I'm late!

[SNOOPY]
Woof!

[ALL except Charlie Brown]
You're a good man, Charlie Brown
You're the kind of reminder we need
You have humility, nobility and a sense of honor that is very
Rare indeed.

[SNOOPY]
Woof!

[OTHERS]
You're a good man, CHarlie Brown
And we know you will go very far

Yes it's hard to believe
Almost frightening to conceive
What a good man you are.

[SCHROEDER]
You are kind.

[OTHERS]
You are kind to all the animals
And every little bird
With a heart of gold
You believe what you're told...

[LUCY]
Every single solitary word

[OTHERS]
You bravely face adversity
You're cheerful through the day
You're thoughtful
Brave and couteous

[LUCY]
And you also have some faults
But for the moment let's just say

[OTHERS]
That you're a good man, Charlie Brown
You're a prince
And a prince could be king
With a heart such as yours
You could open any doors
You could go out and do anything
You could be King Charlie Brown
You could be king!

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Everybody says to me:

[OTHERS]
You're a good man, Charlie Brown

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Every voice in harmony

[OTHERS]
You're a good man, Charlie Brown

[CHARLIE BROWN]
All I need is one more try
Gotta get that kite to fly
And I'm not the kind of guy
Who gives up easily
Wonder why they stop to say:

[OTHERS]
You're a good man, Charlie Brown

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Never liked me, anyway

[OTHERS]
You're a good man, Charlie Brown

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Trying not to rock the boat
Not to make a scene
A good man? Yes
But I confess
I don't know what they mean

I wanna rise like I should
And do everything right
But I lie awake at night...

With questions in my ear

I want to join the dance

[OTHERS]
Oooh
Never sleep
Oooh
Loud and deep
Oooh
Take the leap

[CHARLIE BROWN]
But the answer isn't clear.
Than I hear:

[OTHERS]
Charlie Brown... Charlie Brown...
You're a good man, Charlie Brown
You're a good man, Charlie Brown

[SCHROEDER]
Get on the bus

[LUCY]
Get on the bus

[LINUS]
Go ahead, get on the bus, Charlie Brown!

[SALLY]
Don't wanna be late for school!

[OTHERS]
That's right!

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Don't wanna be late!

[ALL]
Don't wanna be late for school!

[SNOOPY]
Woof!

[OTHERS]
You're a good man,
Charlie Brown
You're the kind
Of reminder we need
You have humility,
Nobility,
And a sense of honor
That is very rare indeed

[CHARLIE BROWN]
There they go again

Don't know what they mean
I'm not good,
I'm not bad

I'm somewhere
In between

[SNOOPY]
Woof!

[OTHERS]
You're a good man,
Charlie Brown

[CHARLIE BROWN]
I don't understand

You're a prince
And a prince could be king
With a heart such as yours
You could open any doors
You could go out 
And do anything
You could be King, Charlie Brown
You could be King!

[CHARLIE BROWN]
"Nothing lasts forever"

[OTHERS]
You could be king

[CHARLIE]
"All good things must end"

I've memorized
That phrase by heart.
So tell me,
I need to know it...

[OTHERS]
Believe it

And you were born for this part

You're a good man,
Charlie Brown!

[CHARLIE]
When do the
Good things start?

[LUCY/SCHROEDER]
You're a good man,
Charlie Brown

[LINUS/SALLY]

Bravely facing
Adversity
You can open up

[SNOOPY]
Oh, You're a good man

[LUCY/SCHROEDER]
You're a good man,
Charlie Brown

[ALL]
You're ad good man,
Charlie Brown!
