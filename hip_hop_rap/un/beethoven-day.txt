[SCHROEDER]
Call the principal 
And hand him the news
We've got a holiday
That he can't refuse
A day of harmony, 
A day of music:
Beethoven's birthday!

[SALLY]
Beethoven Day?

[SCHROEDER]
A reverential mission

[LINUS]
Beethoven Day?

[SCHROEDER]
The hope of each musician
No more am I the only guy
To stand up and say:

Hooray, Beethoven,
Hooray!

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Beethoven Day?

[LINUS]
Yes. As in Ludwig van Beethoven, composer. 
Born 1770, died 1827. The eldest of three sons, 
Ludwig's  mother was the daughter of the chief overseer 
of the kitchen...

[LUCY]
Whatever... Schroeder, I just want you to know that 
I'm on your side. I want to help, publicity-wise, 
with Beethoven's Birthday.

[SCHROEDER]
Thank you for your support, but I just don't 
want to see Beethoven's birthday commercialized.

[LUCY]
Commercialized?

[SCHROEDER]
Yes. The next thing you know they'll be selling 
Beethoven sweatshirts.

Til you know it by heart!

Yet inspired with power
When we all honor
The man we adore
On the day we place
The newest face
On Mount Rushmore!
