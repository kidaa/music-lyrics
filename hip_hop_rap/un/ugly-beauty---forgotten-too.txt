thanks to Julie James for submitting   
the lyrics  

King's side queens 
From the fortress searching 
Watch deeply 
Many heroes at magazines 
They have all bad dreams 
And the souls of thousands 
Of the fear and still they'll be... 

I will be forgotten 
You will be forgotten too 
I will be forgotten 
And you will be forgotten too 

Lets take a walk 
Out of this club 
Into the snow 
Where bell ling my afterglow 

I will be forgotten 
You will be forgotten too 
I will be forgotten 
And you will be forgotten too 

I will be forgotten 
And I will be forgotten 
And you will be forgotten too 
You will be forgotten too 

I will be forgotten 
And I will be forgotten 
And I will be forgotten 
And you will be forgotten too 
You will be forgotten too
