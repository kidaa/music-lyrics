You don't have to shout
From now on I'm out of the kitchen
What's more I can't stand your cigarette brand
And I switchin'
I'm unhappy with things the way they've occurred
It is time to face facts and not mince a word
Certain parties with bird brains are getting the BIRD!
Au revoir, Fare thee well, and good-bye
And I'll tell you why

A funny thing happened on my way to love
I lost the young fellow I've been dreaming of
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call
Into someone who's no fun at all
So I'll start forgetting
What else can I do?
And much thanks for letting me practice on you
It's farewell my lovely
Excuse please my dust
Unravel and travel and lust

No tears
No hurt surprise
It's with a pleasant glow I realize
If I have that much love so deep true and strong
All ready to hand my dear mister wrong
To stew both the treasures, the joy and delight
I'll give to my own mister right.

So hasta lavista, factah, toodle-ooh
The world will keep turning but nut around you
There's someone else waiting who's more than a friend
Best wishes and dishes I'll send
So

So long, I'm on my way
And may I say
If I had this much love so deep true and strong
All ready to hand you my dear mister wrong
Just think of the treasures the joy and delight
I'll give
As long as I live
Day and night
To my own mister right!
