GUS: 
It had to be me, that had to get you. 
I stand five foot ten, a man among men, 
but you're seven two. 
I meet lots of girls when I make the rounds, 
but none are like you, 
seven foot two, seventy pounds. 
But you make me thrill, and you always will. 
I realize Betty you look like spaghetti,
but what can I do?
It's your fingertips that I adore, 
when you stand up, they touch the floor. 
It had to be you, wonderful you, seven foot two.
