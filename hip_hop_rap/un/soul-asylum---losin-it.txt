Go ahead, spit it out, I can take it,  
Don't do this don't do that, try and fake it,  
I, I, I have seen it all  
Tell me there's something wrong, make me see it,  
How i try i must be wrong, it must be me  
I, I, I have been wrong before  
And I confess, that I am having a hard time  
And I confess, that your hard time's harder than mine  
When its over, when its over, I'm coming over,  
Use your shoulder, soon be over  
But I'm losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, losin' it  
Suck it up rip it out, still i'm learnin'  
Light it up put it out, keep it burnin'  
I, I, I've been burned before  
Come on out I know you can make me happy  
Little smile just ahead, make it happen  
I, I, I have smiled before  
And I confess, that I am having a hard time  
And I confess, that your hard time's harder than mine  
When its over, when its over, I'm coming over,  
Use your shoulder, soon be over  
But I'm losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, losin' it  
I'm losin' it, losin' it, losin' it, loose it, loose it, losin' it  
I am having a hard time
