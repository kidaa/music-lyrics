GRACE: Another bride, another June, another sunny honeymoon
GUS: Another season, another reason for makin'
GRACE: 
Whoopee. 
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice, 
the groom is nervous, 
he answers twice.

GUS: It's really killing that he's so willing

GUS: And picture the same sweet love nest, *whistles* what a year can bring.

He's washing dishes and baby clothes, 
he's so ambitious he even sews.

GUS: 
So don't forget folks, that's what you get, folks,

GRACE: Some judge who thinks he's funny *laughs* says you pay six to her.
GUS: And then I say, "Judge, suppose I fail?"
