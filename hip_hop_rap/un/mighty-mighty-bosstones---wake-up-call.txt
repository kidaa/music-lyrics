Not an individual 
Just one of the sheep 
Sure, I'd like to become that 
One in all the people 
But in all this need for wisdom 
And its a major concern 
Till they rescue everyone but you 
There's a lot you gotta learn 

Never ending education 
A welcomed wake up call 
Arriving at the realization 
I might not know it all 

Trying hard to be different 
There's stuff you'll never learn 
So there's no misconceptions 
But it's never too late 
To realize that what you think you know 
Is unjustified 
Wake up and get up 
Step up or step aside 
Never ending education 
A welcomed wake up call 
Arriving at the realization 
I might not know it all 
Never ending education 
A welcomed wake up call 
Arriving at the realization 
I might not know it all 

Think you got the answers 
And still never have a clue 
Noone's got this all worked out 
Don't want to see clear that you 
Don't want to start to search and find 
You search and carry on 
Now there's no lineup on the line 
The line's not clearly drawn 
Never ending education 
A welcomed wake up call 
Arriving at the realization 
I might not know it all 

Never ending education 
A welcomed wake up call 
Arriving at the realization 
I might not know it all 

Never ending education 
And a welcomed wake up call 
Arriving at the realization 
I might not know it all
