My darling you look lovely
I've come to lay you down
Uncover your head and submit to me
We'll make a joyful sound
I don't care if you're by yourself
Or you're all alone when you need my help
Keep that smile on your pretty face
Cause you don't have much I can't take away

Chorus:
Don't you worry baby
You won't feel a thing
Close your eyes 
Holy Roller Novocaine

Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know

You'll be hearin' me comin'
But I can't come inside
I'll be out back in my white Cadillac
Won't you join me for a ride
Let me take you up to the mountain top
There I'll show all the goods I got
Don't look back keep your eyes ahead
This could be the night that the moon goes red

Repeat Chorus

All the world is moanin'
And baby so am I
I'm just givin' you warning
And I'm telling you why

Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
Lord's gonna get us back x4
I know, I know
