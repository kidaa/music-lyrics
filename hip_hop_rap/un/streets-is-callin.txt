[Omarion:]

uh, yea, once again

[chorus:]

I've been goin' through somethings ohhh,
I been strugglin' with my inner man yea,yea, I hustle, I'll do what I
can to get this money,uh,yea,listenI know I promised you somethings somethings,
There's gotta be a better way,
It's not easy to make that change,
The streets keep callin' me

[verse1:]

Last night I'm tryin' to make it home make it home,
I get this call on my phone on my cell,
Stop yellin' Slow down, I can't understand a word you sayin',
Did ya say my nigga got hit? is he dead,
Did ya say he didn't make it? is he dead,
Please tell me you know who did this, I'm on my way and somebody's gonna get it 
Mash the pettle on the highway-seen him,
Heard my baby in the back ground - pleanin,
Come home and leave it alone -
It's out of the question girl it's on
What about his new boy child,
Did ya know that he was born?
I don't wanna hear this shit right now, when they just stretched my nigga out

[chorus]

[verse2:]

Call my name sayin' how you gonna get paid,
No education cuz of minimum wage,
Minimum wage equals minimum pay,
And you know real niggas wanna play,
Won't you come on and move this way,
School don't garuntee a higher pay,
That's the shit that'll get me locked away,
Man they tryin' to give a nigga all day 
Now I'm out here everynight comin' in late,
If you slip then I'm comin' for the take,
It's goin' fast and I need to hit the breaks,
The greater the risk the more you make,
All my thoughts are in the house, what about just shuttin' down,
But girl I really can't quit right now,
Notice on the floor they tryin' to through us out

[chorus]

[hook:]

Although although,
I was raised right ooooo,
Still these streets aint nothin' nice they can't change the coast of life,
And you know that i know i know,
That I must grow must grow,
See my kids grow,
But still the streets are all I know 

[chorus 2x's]
