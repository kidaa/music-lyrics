As we get older, there's nothing surer
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer
Those small misfortunes all start to pile up
And it gets harder to keep a smile up
But we keep hoping, while all dreams linger
That we'll get lucky one fine day
Then once again fate gives us the finger
Once again with a sigh
We look up to the sky
With a quizzical eye
And quietly say:
What are they doing to us now?
What's the latest ruin to us now?
Someone up there is getting careless
What are they doing to us now?
Anyhow, what are they doing to us now?
Makes no difference if a man is slave or king born
He always is to pain and suffering
Naked, he's pushed out his new life to begin
Ain't or not
The awkward way that he came in?
When did he understand just why he's here
Clap comes from the dark
A big smack on the rear
From then on continuous without a stop
Ah, life's the same old story
Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop
Science keeps advancing always on the run
All they seem to do is take from life the fun
Smoking, on and on,
It wears your heart away
Drinking shrinks for you the level day by day
Eating makes you fat
You weighted down to check
Sex you do, you don't, you'll have a nervous wreck
Future generations we are all to one
Hey, then do yourself a favor: don't get born,
Don't get born, don't get born!
What are they doing to us now?
What's the latest ruin to us now?
Careless, what are they doing to us now?
What are they doing...
What are they doing...
What are they doing...
What are they doing...
What are they doing to us now?
