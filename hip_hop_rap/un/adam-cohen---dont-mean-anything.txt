What she wants is for me to say  
That I kept every promise that I made  
But on her hand there's a ring  
That don't mean anything  

I would sit and write her songs  
I vowed that in my heart she belonged  
But all the words I used to sing  
They Don't mean Anything  

It's hard to feel when you don't  
It's hard to say You will when you won't  
And if you do  
It don't mean anything  

I touch her skin  
I smell her hair  
And it might appear that I still care  
I see her legs, they're opening  
It don't mean anything  

It's hard to feel when you don't  
It's hard to say you will when you won't  
and if you do  
It don't mean anything  

On the day I said goodbye  
My melancholy Butterfly just cried  
Tears that sting  
It don't mean anything  
It don't mean anything 3x  
Anything
