the lyrics  

Beautiful girl 
You're a lovely picture 
Beautiful girl 
You're a gorgeous mixer of all their lives 
Under those big blue skies 
My heart cries 
Beautiful girl 
You're a dancing apple 
I could never travel if I have you 
You'll be my dream come true 
There may be blondes and brunettes 
That are hard to resist 
You should pass them like a queen 
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed 
And you're sweet sixteen old 
Beautiful girl 
What a gorgeous creature 
Beautiful girl 
Let me call the creature, what can I do 
But give my heart to you 
If I could write like poets do 
I sang my song all to you 
Beautiful girl, you're my desire 
But when I search for words or phrase 
I'm like a schoolboy in the daze 
When you come my way 
This is all that I can say 
Can't you see my heart just cry 
Beautiful girl 
You're a dancing apple 
Beautiful girl 
I could never travel if I have you 
You'll be my dream come true
