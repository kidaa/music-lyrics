Star havin' a great life 

Oh, what you hurry 
Little brother 
Don't you know that 
God loves ya' 
God loves ya' 
And she loves me too 

Star havin' a great life 
It's about living with inspiration. 
Star havin' a great life. 

Oh, look the living barren men. 
I doubt take it for granted man. 

This is the Carnival 
All for multi quailed dreams 
Behold daring your man 
On that plait trappings 

He's havin' a great life, 
He's living with inspiration. 
Star havin' a great life. 

She takes me twice around the world 
Oh, that music in my head! 

Star havin' a great life 
Star living with inspiration, 
Star havin' a great life. 

Star havin' a great life 
Star living with inspiration 
Star havin' a great life 
Star living with inspiration. 

Not the fucking planned man. 
Not the planned man, mmm, mmm. 
Don't take it for granted man. 
Star havin' a great life.
