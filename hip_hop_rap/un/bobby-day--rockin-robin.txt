He rocks in the tree-top all a day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song 
All the little birds on J-Bird St. 
Love to hear the robin goin' tweet tweet tweet 
Chorus

Rockin' robin tweet tweet tweet 
Rockin' robin tweet tweet tweet 
Oh rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight 

Every little swallow, every chickadee 
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
Flapping them wings sayin' go bird go 
Chorus

A wordy little raven at the bird's first dance 
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand 
He started goin' steady and bless my soul 
He out popped the buzzard and the oriole 

He rocks in the tree-top all a day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song 
All the little birds on J-Bird St. 
Love to hear the robin goin' tweet tweet tweet 
Chorus
