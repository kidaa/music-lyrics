Funny how I feel more myself with you 
Than anybody else that I ever knew 
I hear it in your voice, see it in your face 
You've become the memory I can't erase 

You could have been anyone at all 
A stranger falling out of blue 
I'm so glad it was you 

Wasn't in the plan not that I could see 
Suddenly a miracle came to me 
Safe within your arms I can say what's true 
Nothing in the world I would keep from you 

You could have been anyone at all 
An old friend calling out of blue 
I'm so glad it was you 

Words can hurt you if you let them 
People say them and forget them 
Words can promise words can lie 
But your words make me feel like I can fly 

You could have been anyone at all\ 
And let that catches me when I fall 
I'm so glad it was you
