I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love 
But to you, I give my affection, right from the start. 
I have a lover who loves me - how could I break such a heart? 
Yet still you get my attention. 

Why do you come here, when you know I've got troubles enough? 
Why do you call me, when you know I can't answer the phone? 
And make me lie when I don't want to, 
And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool? 
Make me stay when I should not? 
If you're so strong then resolve the weakness in me. 
Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by? 
I need to see you - I need to hold you - tightly. 

Feeling guilty, 
And I'm worried, and I'm waking from a tormented sleep 
'Cause this old love, you know it has me bound, 
But this new love cuts so deep. 
If I choose now, I'm bound to lose out; 
One of you is gonna have to fall... 
I need you, baby. 

Why do you come here, when you know I've got troubles enough? 
Why do you call me, when you know I can't answer the phone? 
And make me lie when I don't want to, 
And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool? 
Make me stay when I should not? 
If you're so strong then resolve the weakness in me. 
Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by? 
I need to see you - I need to hold you - tightly.
