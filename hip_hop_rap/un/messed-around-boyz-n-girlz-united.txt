Ohhhhhh Heyyyyyy 

Here we go
Riprock, AG, BNG
Chapter 1
Tell em how the story goes

Every little thing that you said was true
I believed in you
But it wasn't meant to be

Wasn't meant to be

And every little thing that you promised me

I promise, I promise
Wasn't honestly what you said it would be, yeah
And I swear
You'll never learn
So I'm givin' you what you deserve
What you deserve

Chorus:
You been livin' in a fantasy
If you think that you could be with me
You tried
Denied 
And now you've got to move on babe
Took a chance when you rolled the dice
Messed Around but you didn't think twice
What's done is done 
I want you out of my life that's right

Dirty 
Everytime the phone rings it's in your eyes
That you wear a disguise
Oh who could it be who could it be
Now you think you can just take me back
But I'll never go back
To what we used to be
'Cause I'll just be deceived
And you say
You've changed 'cause you've cried
But it's time for me to draw the line
Time for me to draw the line

Chorus:
You been livin' in a fantasy
If you think that you could be with me
You tried
Denied 
And now you've got to move on babe
Took a chance when you rolled the dice
Messed Around but you didn't think twice
What's done is done
I want you out of my life

I want you out of my life
I want you out of my life

Chorus 2x
