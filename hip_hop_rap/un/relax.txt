[Hook]
Relax and join this ride
Get ready to get down
Chill out and feel this sound
Rhymes with mad skills, I always keep it real
I will, yo, so I suggest you chill

[Verse 1]
Lay back but don't sleep on this track
My rhymes attack like face smack
Feel the facts blazin' in your area
Copycats I'll bury ya
Hilarious style'n'original Bag rides!
You can't fly with the Murlyn kings, if your wings are fakin' it
You breakin' in the wrong place, makin' it hard to amaze
MCs livin' in the real life
Survivin' this game to the next level they stride

[Verse 2]
We gets down to relax and that's that
Clarify the way so I can dirtify my style
And justify my life while I'm on it
Not a Luniz so I gets ten on it
Messin' with that everyday and every mornin'
Kickin' rhymes to satisfy, get ready to get down
This lyrisista got mad surprizes underground
Magical sounds for you to listen
Unbelievable things in your life that you been really missin'

[Verse 3]
Feel comfortable, as much as possible
I recover you, better than a hospital
With particles from me to all of y'all, relaxation enta this
Knocked down operation, yo, my fist you kissed
You wish you was in my list
I bless you with my lyrics
How could anyone resist this trip
To the unstressable, protectable zone
The correctable choice here is understandable
