GRACE: 
You're nobody's sweetheart now,
they don't baby you somehow.
Fancy hose, silken gown, 
you'd be out of place in your own hometown. 
When you walk down the avenue,
I just can't believe that it's you.
Painted li'l lips,
painted li'l eyes, 
wearing a bird of paradise.
It all seems wrong somehow that
you're nobody's sweetheart now.
