Mmmm.
Delightful.
Mmmm.

Sucking your thumb without a blanket-
is like eating a cone without ice cream!

My blanket and me


[LUCY]
Look at my little baby brother, Linus, with is little baby blanket.

[SALLY]
There's your baby brother with his silly little blanket.

[LUCY]
Well, you know how babies are with their balnkets.

[LINUS]
Whaddya mean?
It's a cozy sanctuary
But it's far from necessary
Cause I'm just as self-reliant as before
As a simple demonstration
Of my independent station
I will go and leave my blanket on the floor
Yes I'll walk away and leave it
Though I know you won't believe it
I'll just walk away and leave it on the floor

Yes, I'll walk
Away
And
Leave
It
On 
The...

Aarrrggghh!

Don't ever let me do that again.

[LUCY]
You're a hopeless case, Linus...
LINUS
I thought I could do it...
I actually thought I could do it.

It's foolish, I know it
I'll try to outgrow it
But meanwhile
It's my blanket...

[LUCY]
And me.

[SALLY]
And me.

[CHARLIE BROWN]
And me.

[SCHROEDER]
And me.

[LINUS]
And
Me.
