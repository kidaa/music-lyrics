How can I give a testimony of my life?
When I'm still trying hard to hold my head up high?
I'm tryin' so hard to hold my head up high.
But every time I turn around,
Feel as though I've let ya down,
Always something else
Every time I turn around,
Feel as though I let you down,
But I can't out run myself
How can I give a testimony of my time?
When its so hard to pen a simple valentine
It weighs a little heavy on my mind
But every time I turn around,
Feel as though I've let ya down,
Always something else
Every time I turn around,
Feel as though I let you down,
But I can't out run myself
Oh, you know....
If I told you once, I've told
you loads before,
I couldn't love you more
But every time I turn around,
Feel as though I've let ya down,
Always something else
Every time I turn around,
Feel as though I let you down,
But I can't out run myself
