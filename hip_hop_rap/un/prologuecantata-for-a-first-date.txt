Woman 1
And the Lord God said, "Let there be light." And there was light.

Man 1
And the Lord God said, "Let there be man and woman."

Woman 2 
And there was man and woman

Man 2
That night man asked woman if she was busy

Woman 2
And woman said, "Thank you, she'd have to check.

Woman 1 
But she's interested in anything long term, she still wants to see other people.

Women 1/2 
He he he he he he he he he he he he

Man 2 
And man said, "There are no other people"

Man 1/2 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Woman 1 
And woman said ok how about this, 
We get married, you vow you're eternal love for me,  
I expell a bunch of miniature humans
Who are totally depended on us for 18 years.

Woman 2 
You get a job, you stay home weekends, 
And you never see another women naked for the rest of your life.

Man 2
And man said

Man 1/2
Ah ah ah ah ah

Women 1
And then thousands

Man 1
And thousands

Women 2
And thousands

Man 2
And thousands of years past

Women 1
And as for man and women...

Man 1
First date, new romance, clean shirt, pressed pants, 
Aftershave, deoderent, electric razor, veloments.

Man 2
Mouthwash, toothpaste, bring the condoms just in case, 
Macho boy, slick the hair, modern man, debonair.

Man 1
I will splash on must.

Man 2
I will knot my tie.

Man 1/2 
And before I go I will check my fly.
It is women who have turned me into this.
A quaff up and dry cleanded guy.

Women 1
Facial creme from a spa, lingerie, wonder bra, 
Hairspray, hairspritz, wax the legs, shave the pits.

Women 2
Appitite, coy and pert, don't eat much, 
No dessert, sweet and low, half and half, smile a lot, fake a laugh.

Women 1
I have primed and plucked

Women 2
I have rubbed on nair.

Women 1/2
I have spent two hours on my face and hair. 
And I did all this for a guy I barely know, and I bet he won't even care.

Man 1
I'll behave real well. Show her just the good stuff only.

Man 2 
I could weave a spell, if I lie about somethings.

Woman 1
I hope he's mature, unlike every guy I've dated.

Woman 2
Still I will endure, someone somewhere dreams of me.

Man 1
But I got baggage, emotioal baggage, a plane load of baggage, 
That causes much saggage, everybody.

All
We've got baggage, emotional draggage, 
And we've been logging around this baggage a long long time.

All spoken
Time!?! Shit!!!!!!!!

All
Will my hopes be met? Will my fear dispell?
Will I captivate? Or will I repel?
Will I show him/her just how wonderful I am? 
Or will I be a date from hell?

All
First date, new romance, different partner, same dance, 
Ready now, almost time, here we go, door bell chime.

All at same time:
Men:                 Women: faster
