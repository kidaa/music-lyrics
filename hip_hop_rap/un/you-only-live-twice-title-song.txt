You only live twice,
Or so it seems.
One life for yourself,
And one for your dreams.
You drift through the years
And life seems tame,
Till one dream appears,
And love is its name.

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on.
Don't think of the danger,
For the stranger is gone.
This dream is for you,
So pay the price.
Make one dream come true,
You only live twice.
