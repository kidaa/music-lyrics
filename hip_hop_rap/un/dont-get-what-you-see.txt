Don't Get What You See 

It's so hard for me to be just what you see 
On E! or MTV you don't get what you see 
At home I don't dress up, I don't fix my hair so what 
Won't let me spend too much 
You don't get what you see 

I'm an ordinary girl doin' what I like 
I don't spend my time the way you think I do 
With all the flash and flare, glam and glitz, nose in the air 
I'm just an average girl doin' my thing for you 

So if you think you see something other than me 
Don't believe the hype it's not right 
I'm just me, I'm just me 
Just me, just me 

It's so hard for me to be just what you see 
On E! or MTV you don't get what you see 
At home I don't dress up, I don't fix my hair so what 
Won't let me spend too much 
You don't get what you see 

So by now I know you see this is really me 
Nothing more or less, this is all you get from me 
I walk with my same old friends, been with me through thick and thin 
Don't wanna live my life so the whole world can see 

I hope my point is clear, I want the world to hear 
That I'll stay the same, never change 
I'm just me, I'm just me 
Just me, just me 

It's so hard for me to be just what you see 
On E! or MTV you don't get what you see 
At home I don't dress up, I don't fix my hair so what 
Won't let me spend too much 
You don't get what you see 

Now you must realize what I display for you 
It's the real from the heart so I must be true 
Understand I'm the boy with the girlz you like 
So I'm my thing but remember don't believe the hype 
On the side I'm the same man with the same 'tude 
Hang with my friends and let's fight the rule 
Everything you see is a fashion rule 
But the truth is that I'm bein' real wit you 

You can't believe everything that you see 
My life ain't make believe 
It's not all fun and games 
Not caught up in the fame 
I thought you heard me when I said I'm just me 
I'm just me 

It's so hard for me to be just what you see 
On E! or MTV you don't get what you see 
At home I don't dress up, I don't fix my hair so what 
Won't let me spend too much 
You don't get what you see...
