Where did we go wrong 
Where did we lose our faith 
Mr brother is in me 
But can he depend on me 
Do you think if one of you tried 
Maybe you could find 
A better friend than any other 
If you gave more than you took 
Life would be so good 
Come on and try, now's the time 
Chorus: 
Because you're free 
To do what you want to do 
You've got to live your life 
Do what you want to do 
x2 chorus 
Are we all strangers 
Does anyone really care 
We're down with all the same 
Trying to hide our pain 
Do you think you could never trust another 
Because they're all out to get ya 
You have to live in this world together 
Open up your heart, love can finally start 
Come on and try, now's the time 
x2 chorus 
Do what you want, do what you wanna do x4 line 
When you're down and you're feeling bad 
Everybody has left you sad 
Feels like no-one will pull you through 
It's your life, what you gonna do 
Make that change, let's start today 
Get outta bed, get on yer way 
Don't be scared, your dreams right there 
You want it, you want it, reach for it 
repeat chorus to fade
