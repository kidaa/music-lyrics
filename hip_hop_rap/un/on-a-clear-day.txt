Why, Daisy, you're a bloody miracle...
Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue
What magic feats or wizardry and voodoo you can do?"
And who would ever guess what powers you possess
And who would not be stunned to see you prove
There's more to us than surgeons can remove
So much more than we ever knew
So much more were we born to do
Should you draw back the curtain, this I am certain
You'll be impressed with you
DAISY
Well, so long doctor, see you later!

On a clear day
Rise and 1ook around you
And you'll see who you are 
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You'll feel part of every mountain sea and shore
You can hear
From far and near
A word you've never, never heard before...
And on a clear day...On a clear day...
You can see forever...
And ever...
And ever...
And ever more. . .
