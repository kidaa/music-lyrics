thanks to Julie James for submitting   
the lyrics  

Looking under the washing machine 
I'm picking up our loveline 
Of dirtier change 
Maybe my old blue jeans 
I haven't worn in a year 
But deep in a pocket 
I've found the whole dollar bill 

Nothing ordinary when you're a kid 
There's nothing ordinary when you're a kid 

Collecting my tickets 
I've been scratching all day 
And maybe I'll get lucky 
I think of move away 
And maybe end of zone, oh 
Or maybe nights... 
And deep in a pocket 
I'm gonna see 

Nothing ordinary when you're a kid 
There's nothing ordinary when you're a kid 

Oh yeah, I think I'm a kid 
Oh yeah, I think I'm a kid 
Oh yeah, I think I'm a kid 
Oh yeah, I think I'm a kid 

I live in a sun baby 
What else could I do? 
I live in a sun baby 
Little too hot for you 
A little too hot for you 
A little too hot for you 
A little too hot for you 
A little too hot for you 
Ooh
