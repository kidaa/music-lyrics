I say goodbye to all my sorrows 
And by tomorrow I'll be on my way 
I guess the Lord must be in New York City 

I'm so tired of getting nowhere 
Seeing my prayers going unanswered 
I guess the Lord must be in New York City 

Well here I am, Lord 
Knocking  on your back door 
Ain't it wonderful to be 
Where I've always wanted to be 
For the first time I'll be free in New York City 

I say goodbye to all my sorrows 
And by tomorrow I'll be on my way 
I guess the Lord must in New York City 

I'm so tired of getting nowhere 
Seeing my prayers going unanswered 
I guess the Lord must be in New York City 

Well here I am, Lord 
Knocking  on your back door 
Ain't it wonderful to be 
Where I've always wanted to be 
For the first time I'll be free in New York City
