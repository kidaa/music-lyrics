[Verse 1]  
Stand, Navy, out to sea, Fight our battle cry;  
We'll never change our course, So vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y.  
Roll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh. Sail on to victory  
And sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!  
[Verse 2]  
Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh.  
Farewell to college joys, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.  
Through our last night on shore, drink to the foam,  
Until we meet once more. Here's wishing you a happy voyage home.
