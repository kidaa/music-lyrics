Introducing atl
Rapping: 
Im the one you done heard all them rumors about, 
You vibrate like my celly how you move it around in that new gear
Fresh on like she on the runway let's run the same bar sunday to sunday, 
Ya nails done and them braids all twisted if you got a flaw 
I guess I just missed it I'm not easy to reach my digits unlisted come close but don't stain with your lipstick

First verse: 
Been around the world seen so many girls but, 
None have moved me quite the way she does and 
I've done some things with some ghetto queens it was just for fun but now 
I think Im in love, 
I can't stop thinking bout her she everywhere that go and she know 
I just can't live without her whoa shes taken over me 
I can't control how she fills me up so much without a single touch. 

Chorus: 
Shorty your the one, your the only girl 
I need only one I want only girl meant for me, 
Got me open baby girl just let me know if you wanna go.

Second verse: 
Your a winner so you gotta be choosy cause you can't love everybody, 
I live my life like a movie act like you know somebody, 
Gonna give you what you need babe already told you star of the tape 
I'ts nothin else you need to know so come and get on board! 

Bridge: 
Your the one I'm diggin and I guess 
I'm hopin that your catchin the same feelins, 
Let me know, cause your my favorite girl in the whole wide world yes your so fine 
I gotta make you mine

Choruse: 
Shorty your the one, your the only girl i need, 
Only one i want, only girl meant for me, 
Got me open, baby girl let me know, 
If you wanna go let me sat it again
Your the one im diggin, and i guess im hopin that you catchin the same feelins let me know
Cause your my favorite girl in the whole wide world yea your so fine i gotta make you mine

Rapping: 
Like rocky road my chain be all chunky 
High school thought that I failed since they flunked me now I'm in double xl it's so funny 
High schools double my sales 
I'm gettin money get ya money money money!
Like my bunnies pretty with pink tummies call me pooh bear 
I'm baggin all the hunnies they sick to ponit where they nose is gettin runny yall freeze on the ave
I recline where It's sunny.
I can't stop thinking bout her she everywhere that 
I go I just can't live without her so, whoa she, she's taken over me 
I can't control how she fills me up so much without a single touch, 
Your the one I'm diggin and I guess I'm hopin that your catchin the same feelins, 
Let me know cause your my favorite girl in the whole wide world yea your so fine i gotta make you mine.
