What've you got?

[ALL]
Team!
There is no team like the best team
Whis is our team right here.
We will show you we're the best team
Of the very Little League this year
And in no time We'll be big time
With the Big League baseball stars.
For all we have to do is win just one more game
And the championship is ours.

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Dear Pen pal...
You'll never guess what happened today
At the baseball game.
It's hard to believe, what happened today
At the baseball game.
I was the manager, Schroeder was catcher
And all of the team was the same as always
But somehow or other disaster struck 
At the baseball game.
Huddle up!

[LUCY]
I got it!

[LINUS]
I got it!

[SCHROEDER]
I got it!

[SNOOPY]
Woof woof woof!

[LUCY to Charlie Brown]
I thought you had it

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Three balls, two strikes,
The bases were loaded with two men out
I pitched my curve, but somehow they hit it
A good strong clout
"Lucy" I hollered, "It's coming right to you"-
She caught it as easy as pie-- then dropped it.
I don't think it's good for a team's morale
To see their manager cry.

Snoopy helped out by biting the runner
And catching the ball in his teeth;
Linus caught flies from a third-story window
By holding his blanket beneath.

yes, we had fortitude,
no one could argue with that.
And one run would win us the game
As I came up to bat.

[LUCY]
All right, Charlie Brown, we're all behind you-sort of.
I mean this man can't pitch. He pitches like my grandmother,
Charlie Brown. Now all you have to is bear down, just bear
down- and when you get on first, watch for my signals.

[OTHERS]
Go Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown-
There is no team 
Like the best team
Which is our team
Right here
We will show you
We're the best team
In the very Little League this year
An in no time we'll be big time
With the Big League baseball stars

For all we have to do is
Win just one more game...

[LUCY]
...And the championship is ours!!

[OTHERS echoing]
Ours! Ours! Ours!

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Two me were on with two outs and me
With one strike to go

[OTHERS whispered]
One strike... One Strike...

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Then I saw her- this cute little 
Red-headed girl I know
Firmly I vowed I would win it for her
And I shouldered my bat and I swung...

[OTHERS]
Oh!

[CHARLIE BROWN]
Dear pen pal, I'm told where you live
Is really quite far
Would you please send directions
On how I can get where you are?

Your friend, Charlie Brown.
