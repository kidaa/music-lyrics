Well I got a silly little girl, she's on my mind  
Look at her, she looks so fine  
She's a best girl I've ever had  
Except that she's gonna make me feel so sad  

Na na na naa...na na naa na naa...  
Na na na naa...na na naa na naa...  

Hush, hush...I thought heard you're calling my name now  
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now  
Hush, hush...I thought I heard you're calling my name now  
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now  

Early in the morning, late in the evening  
Oh gotta believe me honey, I never was a dreamer  

Hush, hush...I thought heard you're calling my name now  
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now  
Hush, hush...I thought I heard you're calling my name now  
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now  

Early in the morning, late in the evening  
ohhh yeah...  

Na na na naa na na naa na naaa...  
Na na na naa na na naa na naaa...  
Naaaaa naa naa naaaaa naa naa naaaaa naa naa naaaaaaa...
