[SALLY]
"oh, yeah. That's what you think."

[SCHROEDER]
What?

[SALLY]
That's my new philosophy: "Oh, yeah? 
That's what you think!"

[SCHROEDER]
Well, why are you telling me?

[SALLY]
What?

[SCHROEDER]
Why are you telling me?

[SALLY]
"Why are you telling me?" I like it!
That's a good philosophy: "Why are you telling me?"
Why are you telling me?"

"Why are you telling me?"
My new philosophy
The teacher gave a "D" on last week's homework
She said, "Miss Sally Brown,
Your grades are going down."
I could have told her-

[SCHROEDER]
You new philosophy?

[SALLY]
My new philosophy!
[as teacher]
Miss B?
[as herself]
I'm she

Look see.
A "D?"
A "D."
Well, why are telling me?
And that's my new philosophy!

[SCHROEDER]
That's your new philosophy?

[SALLY]
Why are you telling me?
My new philosophy!

[SCHROEDER]
That's great, Sally, but I've gotta go practive Chopin's
Nocturne in B-Flat minor.

[SALLY]
No!! I like it! "No!" That's a good philosophy.
"No!" "No!" "No!"

[SCHROEDER]
That's you new philosophy, huh?

[SALLY]
Yes. I mean-- "No!"
Just like a bust bee
Each new philosophy
Can fly from tree to tree and keep me moving
When life's a dizzy maze
On alternating days
I choose a different phrase-

[SCHROEDER]
Your new philosophy?

[SALLY]
My new philosophy!

[SCHROEDER]
Sally!
Some philosophies are simple:
"Man does not eat by bread alone."
Some philosophies are clear:

[SALLY]
"Leave your message at the sound of the tone."

[BOTH]
Some philosophies pick and choose
Deciding what goes in it.

[SCHROEDER]
Some take a lifetime,

[SALLY]
Mine take a minute.

[SCHROEDER]
But, Sally, anything that takes only a minute can't be
very lasting. For instance, Beethoven took over two years
to complete his brilliant Ninth SYmphony.

[SALLY]
"No!"

[SCHROEDER]
I can't stand it!

[SALLY]
"I can't stand it!" I like it!
It's like a gurantee.
My new philosophy.
And things are sure to be a whole ot brighter
"Oh, yeah? That's what you think!"
"Why are you telling me?"
"No!"
"I can't stand it!"
Now life is free and easy,
Much more philosophy-zy,
With my brand new-

You know, someone had said that we should live every day as 
if it were the last day of our life.

[LUCY passing by and overhearing]
Aaugh! This is the last day!! This is it!! I only have 
twenty-four hours left!! Help me! Help me! This is the last
day!! Aaugh!

[SALLY]
Clearly, some philosophies aren't for all people.
And that's my new philosophy!
