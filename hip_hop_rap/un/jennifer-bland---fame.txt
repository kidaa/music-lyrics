Baby look at me 
And tell me what you see 
You ain't seen the best of me yet 
Give me time I'll make you forget the rest 

I got more in me 
And you can set it free 
I can catch the moon in my hand 
Don't you know who I am 

Remember my name Fame I'm gonna live forever 
I'm gonna learn how to fly high I feel it comin' together 
People will see me and I Fame I'm gonna make it to heaven 
Light up the sky like a flame Fame I'm gonna live forever 
Do you remember my name 

Baby hold me tight 
'Cause you can make it right 
You can shoot me straight to the top 
Give me love and take all I got to give 

Baby I'll be tough 
Too much is not enough 
I surround your heart 'til it breaks 
You have got what it takes 

CHORUS 
Remember my name Fame I'm gonna live forever 
I'm gonna learn how to fly high I feel it comin' together 
People will see me and I Fame I'm gonna make it to heaven 
Light up the sky like a flame Fame I'm gonna live forever 
Baby remember my name 

Fame I'm gonna make it to happen 
Light up the sky like a flame Fame I'm gonna live forever 
Baby remember my name 

REPEAT CHORUS
