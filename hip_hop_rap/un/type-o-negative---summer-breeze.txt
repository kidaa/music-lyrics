See the curtains hangin' in the window  
In the evening on a friday night  
A little light-a-shinin' through the window  
Lets me know everything's all right  

Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind  

See the paper layin' on the sidewalk  
A little music from the house next door  
So I walk on up to the door step  
Through the screen and across the floor  

Sweet days of summer - the jasmine's in bloom  
July dressed up and playing her tune  
And I come home from a hard day's work  
And you're waitin' there  
Not a care in the world  

See the smile awaitin in the kitchen  
Food cookin' and the plates for two  
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me  
In the evening when the day is through
