My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 

Strip of jerky, long and lean 
Serve it up with a side of me 

My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 

She's the one, she's crazy and wild 
Knocked me off with the hip in her style 

My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 

Got the number of the bathroom store 
It was late but she took my call 
Come on baby won't you give me a kiss 
She not may see me through the bold of this 
She's a meaner in a house on hill 
Kicks me in bed, to the big old VIP 
I rolled it up, oh baby you're so sweet 
And there's a running naked in a country hip 

She's the one, she's crazy and wild 
Knocked me off with the hip in her style 

My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 

Whoo- hoo! 

My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 
My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 

She's a meaner in a house on hill 
Kicks me in bed, to the big old vip 
I rolled it up, oh baby you're so sweet 
And there's a running naked in a country hip 

She's the one, she's crazy and wild 
Knocked me off with the hip in her style 

My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 
My baby's got the strangest ways of sayin' 
Whoo-hoo, hoo-wee! 

My baby, my baby 
My baby, my baby
