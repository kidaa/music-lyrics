One hundred days  
I still haven't found the words I wanna say  
So I thought it through  
I tried but I couldn't get a hold of it  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm fallin to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
One hundred nights  
Sit and talk to the moonlight  
Thought it was a phase  
Thought it'd slowly just slip away  
but it never fades  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm fallin to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm falling to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
I always thought it'd be so easy  
But now I guess I'll just get over it  
get over it, get over it  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm fallin to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm falling to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm fallin to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
My head is spinning around  
Think I'm falling to the ground  
I'm fallin down  
down, down, down, down  
falling down, falling down, falling down, falling down
