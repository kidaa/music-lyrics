[O'Dell]
Havin freaky dreams girl
I must be dreaming
Freaky dreaming
One, you know I can get the job done
Two, all night dreaming of you
Three, girl what's it gonna be
You know you like the thug in me
Four, let's do it on the floor
Five, constantly on my mind
Six, baby can you get with this
All the time I'm freaky dreaming
I've been having a hard time
With all the things you've put on my mind
Don't know if I'll ever sleep again
Can't stop these freaky dreams I'm having again
You don't know what you've been doin to me
Got me tweekin, girl I don't know if I'll sleep again
My body's calling, feel it's hard to find
Let's have our meeting, let's work it all through the night
One, you know I can get the job done
Two, all night dreaming of you
Three, girl what's it gonna be
You know you like the thug in me
Four, let's do it on the floor
Five, constantly on my mind
Six, baby can you get with this
All the time I'm freaky dreaming
[Mr. Serv-On]
It's miserable, you miserable, it's typical
I gotta need that sex, so if I see a few things on you boo, that's kissable
So messy, like Biggie, who you bee's with
The question really is you messin with this
Little girl , you might get yourself hurt playin with this
They like to hit you, I just wanna do some personal thangs with you
No shopping malls, just your legs up with your back against the shower wall
Ball you in knots, breathe in your easy spots
Cross your legs on my shoulder, roll you over, girl you excited soldier
Yeah I know what he put you through
But tonight I'm trying to find out what you don't wanna do
Dress you in Victoria fatigues, rub your body with my Mercedes keys
You know I'm a little heated, I can't promise I'm a be soft when I treat it
Last time we barely knew each other
By the way, how the finest woman in your house doin your mother
But you know what, 
It's time to worry bout what we goin do tonight
So when you come calling 
if you gonna be late in the morning cause I'ma do it right

Serv-On, O'Dell.
Ain't no limit shorty I told you.
Last time that we got together it was like the playoffs.
This time you like my homie Tee Martin in Tennessee.
Straight up run this whole thing.
It's the championship right now.
See tonight, one of us gotta leave the champ.
I represent the tank baby.
Freaky dreams baby, freaky dreams.
