[Hook]
Though I'm missing you
Although I'm missing you
I'll find away to get through
I'll find away to get through
Living without you
'cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only god may know why, still I will get by

[Brandy]
I would've known, that you had to go so suddenly, so fast
How could it be, that sweet memories would be all, all that we have left.
Now that you're gone, every day I go on I go on
But life it's not the same life's just not the same
I'm so empty inside, and my tears I can't hide but I'll try to face the pain

[Repeat hook]

[Gladys]
Oh there was so many things
That we could have said, un-huh
And time was on our side time was on our side
Ooh, yeah
Now that you're gone, I can still feel you near
So I'll smile, with every tear I cry

[Repeat hook]

[Chaka]
How sweet were the losses to spare?
But I'll wait for the day
When I'll see you again, see you again, yeah

[Repeat hook]

[All]
I'm missing you
