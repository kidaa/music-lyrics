1 - What's a sunny day without you 
Just another twenty-four that passes by 
What's a sunny day without you 
Just another twenty-four that passes by 

As I sit upon 
The grass in the shade 
I reminisce on what we had 
The moments that we shared 
Strolling through the park 
Two people in love walking hand in hand 

2 - But now, that you're gone 
I feel, so alone 
All I do is think of you 
Til the day you return 
It doesn't mean a thing 

Repeat 1 

It's funny how 
You learn from your mistakes 
Sometimes we take things for granted 
But now that I have a chance to make it right 
I wanna give you, I wanna give you all my love 

Repeat 2 
Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 

3 - What's a sunny day  
What's a sunny day that passes by 
What's a sunny day 
What's a sunny day that passes by 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 
Repeat 3 
Repeat 1 til end of song
