[Verse 1:]
Give me a sour power 
I'ma need a sponge roller and some sweet pajamas 
Give me some Donnie Simpson 
On Video Soul where I got my first attention 
'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar 
Want a guaranteed single, not an album filler 
Give me some 90's music 
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it 

[Chorus:]
All my people they hear this and be askin' 'what?' 
Brandy on the radio, turn it up! 
Timbaland, you know how to bang the club 
Give my people something to shake their butts 
All my people they hear this and be askin' 'what?' 
Brandy on the radio, turn it up! 
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs 
Give my people something to shake their butts 

It's something big! 

[Verse 2:]
The Kid n' Play reunion 
Give me House Party, give me House of Music 
Yup, gimme 92 and 
lemme do my thing on it so they won't refuse it 
Make it hot, get Babygirl's attention 
She's more than a woman and we sure do miss her 
I wanna represent her 
Timabaland, Missy, you get the picture 

Give it up, we gon' show you how we party 
Give it up, we gon' show you how we party 
Give it up, we gon' show you how we party 
Give it up, we gon' show you how we party 

[Chorus:]
All my people they hear this and be askin' 'what?' 
Brandy on the radio, turn it up! 
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs 
Give my people something to shake their butts 
All my people they hear this and be askin' 'what?' 
Brandy on the radio, turn it up! 
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs 
Give my people something to shake their butts 

[Bridge:]
Bang this joint for all the clubs 
All my people, all my folks 
Hit the streets and tell your friends 
Your girl Brandy is back again 
Is everybody ready? 
Here I come 
Is everybody ready? 
It's been long enough 
Is everybody ready? 
I'm overdue 
Is everybody ready? 
Here for you 

[Chorus:]
All my people they hear this and be askin' 'what?' 
Brandy on the radio, turn it up! 
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs 
Give my people something to shake their butts 
All my people they hear this and be askin' 'what?' 
Brandy on the radio, turn it up! 
Timbaland, you know how to bang the clubs 
Give my people something to shake their butts 

Give me a sour power 
I'ma need a sponge roller and some sweet pajamas 
Give me some Donnie Simpson 
On Video Soul where I got my first attention 
Give me a sour power 
I'ma need a sponge roller and some sweet pajamas 
Give me some Donnie Simpson 
On Video Soul where I got my first attention 

Give me some 90's music 
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it 
Give me some 90's music 
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it 
Give me some 90's music 
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it 
Give me some 90's music 
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it 

Give me some 90's music 
I want Timbaland on it, I know he can do it
