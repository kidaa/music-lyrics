[Chorus]
It's a shame you have to learn the hard way
Now I have to take my love away
U see I could've made it easy
For you to become a part of me

You could've even say I'm sorry
For all the hurt and pain you caused me
Now I am supposed to give my deepest sympathy
You see I had enough of cryin'
And I'm tired of all the lyrin'
You see I refuse to let you take advantage of me baby
[Chorus]

Never took the time to think of 
All the love that we have shared
I realized that most of the time 
You were just not there
It was hard for me to see when
When your love was blinding me
But now I know I have to let you go your seperate way
[Chorus]

Things will never be the same
Cause baby, baby you did me wrong
Hurt so bad I can't move on
Was it worth all of your pain
Cause, baby you've got to pay
Got to learn the hard way
[Chorus]
