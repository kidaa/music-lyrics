[INTRO]
Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
Baby please, 'cause it's not worth it
[VERSE 1]
You came into my life
And it's so funny
How you made everything right
And now you're saying to me
Something ain't right
What did I do
Did I hurt you
Baby can you tell me
How to dry your eyes
But let me say
I never meant to make you cry
If anything I meant to
Be right by your side
How did I go wrong
When my love was strong
And all I ever wanted was you
[B-SECTION]
If I can ease the pain
Whatever it takes to
That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you
[CHORUS two times]
Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
'Cause it's not worth it
[VERSE 2]
You mean the world to me
And all I do is try to give you all of me
I never do anything that wouldn't be pleasing to you
I never knew that you were hurting
And I'll take the blame for anything that I've done
That has caused you pain
I never meant to hurt you in any way
So this day, I wanna say
Baby please forgive me
[B-SECTION]
[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
Don't wanna see you this way
What must I do to make it all brand new
Let me take the pain away
Anything for you, 'cause baby I love you
[CHORUS out]
