[1st Verse]
Look at me I'm a mess y'all 
Ain't combed my hair in weeks 
No appetite my mama's so worried bout me 
My friends keep calling asking if I need company 
I say I'm okay y'all just let me be  
Cause I'm still going through withdrawals every now and then 
Y'all bear with me 
Cause I find time heals all wounds 
I'll be good soon I'll be me again

[Chorus]
I was once strung out on love but now I'm sober
Needed to rehab a bit but now I'm sober
He was my addiction he was in my system
But now I'm great and straight
Must not be strung out on love
but now I'm sober

[2nd Verse]
With every day I grow stronger
I try to get back on my feet
It's difficult quitting something cold turkey
The cravings there still alot of love in me
Can't give up this is how it has to be
Cause I'm still going through withdrawals every now and then 
Y'all bear with me 
Cause I find time heals all wounds 
I'll be good soon I'll be me again

[Chorus]
I was once strung out on love but now I'm sober
Needed to rehab a bit but now I'm sober
He was my addiction he was in my system
But now I'm great and straight
Must not be strung out on love
but now I'm sober

[Bridge]
Loving him almost killed me
I was like a junkie
Trying to get my fix of
What I thought was love
Was really just a drug
I had to break myself from

[Chorus]
I was once strung out on love but now I'm sober
Needed to rehab a bit but now I'm sober
He was my addiction he was in my system
But now I'm great and straight
Must not be strung out on love
but now I'm sober
[until fade]
