
Turn me up a little louder! 

I started writing the music in my head, 
I'm gonna find no words while I'm still open there, 
You give me hope, you give me love, you give me faith, 
So I sing this lyric about this love we share.

I don't know what I ever do without your love! 
But now I'm alright! 
I will never get enough! 
Will you take control of me, 
When you call me so, so sweet, 
And now I'm singing what I'm feeling! 

I can't until you get home, 
I wanna sing you this song! 
You can call me on the phone, 
I wanna sing you this song! 
I haven't seen you for so long, 

Wanna sing you this song! 
This song! This song! 
A little louder, a little louder! 
I can't until you get home, 
I wanna sing you this song! 
You can call me on the phone, 
I wanna sing you this song! 
I haven't seen you for so long, 
Wanna sing you this song! 
This song! This song! 
A little louder, a little louder! 

With the music on my ear you sound so clear! 
A simple melody and harmony's on air.
I can't hear you in the beat of my old drum, 
So I think about you while I sing this song!
