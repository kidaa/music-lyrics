[Chorus]
Thank you 
For all the tears 
All the tears all the stress 
Your the best 
I feel blessed 
Im a better woman now
Look how I smile 
All you did was help the next man
This experience made 
Me who I am 

[Verse 1]
I tried to make me love ya 
i tried to make me stay 
But every time i tried 
Myself and i got in the way 
Just for the sake of my daughter 
I tried to stick to the plan 
But i had to get rid of the weight
On my fourth finger, left hand 
To every body listening
Sorry if your disappointed
See the life i chose was only what
I thought i wanted
Nothings picture perfect
Looks can be deceiving
What i thought was love
Was something that i did not believe in

[Chorus]
Thank you 
For all the tears 
All the tears all the stress 
Your the best 
I feel blessed 
Im a better woman now
Look how I smile 
All you did was help the next man
This experience made 
Me who I am 

[Verse 2]
I always had the feelin'
That baby boy was cheatin'
I kept tellin' myself
If you aint happy Bran just leave him
I wasn't raised to quit
Cause quiters never win
But what do you gain
If you feel incomplete within?
Sick of all the questions
All the whats and whys
"What happened?"
"Why'd ya'll break up?"
"Why we never see you cry?"
But do you know how it feels
To hurt behind closed doors
When you go outisde
You wonder why your smiling for

[chorus]
Thank you 
For all the tears 
All the tears all the stress 
Your the best 
I feel blessed 
Im a better woman now
Look how I smile 
All you did was help the next man
This experience made 
Me who I am 

[Bridge]
Now that its over i can live
Now all you had belongs to him
My heart is open like a book
And everything he eats, i cook
What i am to him, he is to me
We are eachothers everything
But if i would have stayed with you
I wouldnt have it like i do

[chorus 2X]
Thank you 
For all the tears 
All the tears all the stress 
Your the best 
I feel blessed 
Im a better woman now
Look how I smile 
All you did was help the next man
This experience made 
Me who I am
