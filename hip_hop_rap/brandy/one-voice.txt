I ad a dream, a crazy vision 
It may sound strange, this intuition 
But it was true beyond description 
And somehow I knew that it was real 
When I saw 

One sky above, there is just one source of love 
If I've got one chance, one choice 
I'll sing it from the heart 
One song, one voice 

I've seen the fires of deep division 
The hearts of stone, the cold ambition 
But I have found my sacred mission 
To live in this world and still believe 
That there is 

One sky above, there is just one source of love 
If I've got one chance, one choice 
I'll sing it from the heart 
One song, one voice 

A song that heals 
A melody of reason and freedom 
With wordsthat will speak for the weak 
The hopeful and the strong 
Sing is for everyone 

Cause there is one sky above 
There is just one source of love 
If I've got one chance, one choice 
I'll sing it from the heart 
One song, one voice 

Yes there is only one sky above 
One source of love 
If I got one chance, one choice 
So sing it from the heart 
One song, one voice 

Sing it with one song 
One voice
