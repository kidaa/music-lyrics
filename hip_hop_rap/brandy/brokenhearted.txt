
Da da 
Da da da da 
Da da da da 
Da da da da, da da [repeat]

I'm young but I'm wise 
Enough to know that you 
Don't fall in love over night 
That's why I thought if I 
Took my time that everything 
In love would be right 
But as soon as I closed my eyes 
I was sayin' to love Goodbye

[1-]
But I guess I'm 
Lonely brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over

No more empty conversation 
Next time I will be totally sure 
Don't want the pain of falling 
In and out of love 
It's more than my poor heart should endure 
So I listen to all the advice 
And remember each time I cry

[REPEAT 1]

While I'm lonely brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over 
Da Da Da 
Oh Ya 
Da Da Da Da Da 
Wow Ya 
A Da, Oohh

I listen to all the advice 
And remember each time I cry

Only brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over

Lonely brokenhearted 
Life's not over 
I can start again 
While I'm lonely brokenhearted 
It's a hurting thing to get over [repeat till end]
