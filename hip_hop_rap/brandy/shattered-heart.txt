
Don't shatter my heart [x5]

I've been saving up this treasure for years 
I hid it somewhere so no-one could touch it, yeh 
With every love I had some reason to leave 
No other like it 'cause it's so authentic 

Many driver couldn't bear her though 
Try to break through the gate but didn't have the gaul 
When I looked in your eyes, I felt a glitch, yeh 
So I present you with my most precious gift 

I put my love in a jar 
In my heart, like a piggybank 
And I'm giving it to you 
So whatever you do... 

Don't shatter my heart [x9]

Never knew that love can be so epic, yeh 
But you save me 'cause you're all heroic 
Legend has it that you've earned this throne 
Since you came and pulled the sword out the stone 

Many driver couldn't weather the storm 
You came in my life and turned the lights on 
Now when you touch me baby, I can't resist 
So I present you with my most precious gift 

I put my love in a jar 
In my heart, like a piggybank 
And I'm giving it to you 
So whatever you do... 

Don't shatter my heart 

In a big emergency 
Don't break the glass, call me 
Our love can save anything like the father 
Believe me 
I'll give you my all 'cause 
My heart makes me stronger 
And if you pour into it 
I can go even harder 

I put my love in a jar 
In my heart, like a piggybank 
And I'm giving it to you 
So whatever you do... 

Don't shatter my heart [x25]
