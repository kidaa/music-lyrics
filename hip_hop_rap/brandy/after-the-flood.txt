
I'm dryin all up
I'ma change all the plans
So I can take a stand
I'ma clear it up [x2]
Storm is over

I'm in freezing, my mouth turning blue
This time not from screaming, but crying for you
You gave me a teardrop
I gave you a flood
But I'm lost in here now, and you just gave up

[Pre-chorus]
I can't believe in overtaking me
Feel like I'm drowning from the hurt oh no
My feelings were securing me
But now the dam has let my feelings go

[Chorus]
Love is a natural disaster
Can't stop it from happenin'
Just make the day after
Day after the flood
It's like a natural disaster
I'm gonna outlast it
Till the day after
Day after the flood [x2]

I'm dryin all up
I'ma change all the plans
So I can take a stand
I'ma clear it up [x3]
Storm is over

I'm floating in sorrow
I'm way past a leak
I feel a tsunami right here in my cheek
But after the storm I can see my relief
Cause all of my pain is floating around me

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

I'm dryin all up
I'ma change all the plans
So I can take a stand
I'ma clear it up [x3]
storm is over

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
