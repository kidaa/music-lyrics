[Chorus: 2x]
What's a sunny day without you 
Just another 24 that passes by

As I sit upon the grass in the shade 
I remains on what we had the romance 
That's we shared strolling through the park 
Two people in love walking hand in hand 
But now that your gone I feel so alone 
All I do is think of you till the 
Day you return it doesn't mean a thing

[Chorus x2]

It's funny how you learn from your mistakes 
Sometimes we take things for grated 
But now that I have a change to make it right 
I wanna give you 
I wanna give you all my love oh oh

But now but now 
That your gone that your gone 
I feel I feel so alone 
All I do is think of you 
Till the day you return 
It doesn't mean a thing

[Chorus x4]

What's a sunny day without you [x4]

[Chorus till fade]
