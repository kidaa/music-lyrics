[Verse 1]
I've been waiting, I don't have to wait no more
found what I was looking for
with you, I will spend my life, standing by your side
no more, lonely nights at home
sitting by the telephone
now that I have you, I won't let you go, I will give you all of me, baby

[Chorus]
You make me feel so good
I always knew you would
touch my spot, make me hot all over
you make me feel so good
I always knew you could
be the one to give me some, I need it now
you make me feel so good

[Verse 2]
When we're alone, when you hit the light, everytime you spend the night
even mornings, I always want some more, I can't get enough of you
my body, loves the way you feel
you know you got sex appeal
I can't help it, I can not say no
you know you have all control

[Bridge]
Everytime you touching me everytime your touching me
think I'm dreaming please don't wake me up no
cus you mean so much to me so much to me
I wanna give you my all give you my all
baby, when your close to me baby when your close to me
there's no where else I wanna be nooo
when your touching me it sets me free freee
take me up, I don't wanna come down
no no no no no, oh whoa

[Chorus]
You make me feel so good so good, yea yea
I always knew you would
touch my spot make me hot all over make me, all over
you make me you make me feel so good 
I always knew you could
be the one to give me some, I need it now
you make me feel so good

[Guitar plays]

You make me feel....

[Repeat chorus 1x]
