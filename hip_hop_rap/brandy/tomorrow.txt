
If you would only treat me right 
I'd stay here by your side 
But I am down to my last cry 
So I'm leaving you goodbye 
You turned away from opportunities 
To sit and talk things through 
But now when I say I'm leaving you 
You have so much to prove 

So long to all my pain 
Good night to my heartache 
Goodbye sorrow 
I won't cry no more 
I'm leaving tomorrow 

Stop writing me sweet letters and 
Calling me on the phone 
We argued constantely when I saw you 
Always left me in the cold 
I made the choice to finally go 
Cause I can't stand this pain 
It's time for my last tear to fall 
And me to smile again 

Sorrows and heartache goodbye 
I'm leaving you 
Don't wanna meet again 
Has got to be the end 
The end 

The sun will finally shine on me 
And clouds will drift away 
There's something that's in store in me 
That's my brighter day 

Now I just can't wait 
Tomorrow's too late 
I'm leaving you today
