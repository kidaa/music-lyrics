
I could feel it when I woke up this morning
I just knew it when I opened my eyes
Don't know what it is 
but I know something's coming up for me
Ahh yeah
And I don't even have no expectations
I've been burned 
I've been hurt
Yeah I've cried
I've survived all those trials and tribulations
And I'm back, alive, oh yeah

The most wide open
For love hopin'
Freedom to go wherever you are
Nothing can hold me down
Nobody's gonna talk me out of it
I don't know where or when
But I feel it in my heart

I'm gonna find my love love, love, yeah [x2]
I'm gonna find my love 
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
could you be

I have groomed myself to be a real good woman
Now I'm ready for the chance to love again
And I promise I will give my all
And all I have to give
Everything love oh yeah
With my arms open

The most wide open
For love hopin'
Freedom to go wherever you are
Nothing can hold me down
Nobody's gonna talk me out of it
I don't know where on when
But I feel it in my heart

I'm gonna find my love love, love, yeah [x2]
I've gotta find it

I'm gonna find my love
could you be, could you be
I've gotta find it
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
Gotta find my love

I keep my chin to the sky
Looking for loves high
They blind both of my eyes
Til the day I die
I hear the doves fly
In and out of my mind
I see the size of the time
Hittin' me like a punchline
Love
I'm not a shootin' star 
I'm stuck still in the sky 
You could catch me on a mountain high
You can bless me with the right guy
You could put me in his eye line
Hurry up it's about time

The most wide open
For love hopin'
Freedom to go wherever you are
Nothing can hold me down
Nobody's gonna talk me out of it
I don't know where on when
But I feel it in my heart

I'm gonna find my love love, love, yeah [x2]
I've gotta find it 
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
could you be, could you be
I've gotta find it
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
could you be, could you be
I've gotta find it
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
could you be, could you be
I've gotta find it
could you be, could you be
I'm gonna find my love
Gotta find my love
