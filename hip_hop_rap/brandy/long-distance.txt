
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time. 
And I'm running out of things to do to get you off my mind oh whoa. 
All I have is this picture in a frame oh ah, 
that I hold close to see your face everyday. 

With you is where I'd rather be, 
but we're stuck where we are. 
It's so hard, you're so far.. 
This long distance is killing me. 
I wish that you are here with me, 
but we're stuck where we are 
it's so hard, you're so far.. 
This long distance is killing me. 

It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are, you're so far. 
This long distance is killing me. 
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are, you're so far 
so hard, so hard, where we are, where we are, your so far. 
This long distance is killing me. 

Now the minutes feel like hours 
and the hours feel like days.. whoa oh whoa 
While I'm away way-ayyyy 
You know right now I can't be home ahhhhhh 
But I'm coming home soon ahhhhhh

With you is where I'd rather be where I'd rather be.., 
but we're stuck where we are oh oh.
