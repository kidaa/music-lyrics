[Brandy Talking]
An Angel is always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had u fooled
Cause she was an Angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So left me only to find hurt and pain involves her
But now you see your mistakes
And now u see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See baby my love is true
And most importantly Still I Love You

[Chorus x2:]
Angel in disguise she was 
But somehow you fell for her 
Until she broke your heart that day 
And left you in the rain 
But still I love you 

I found it quite strange 
The way you said her name 
And when you look in her eyes 
I see the lust you can't deny 
It's more to this tahn what you say 
Cause in your sleep you called her name 
You say she's just a friend 
I knew right then cause the rain began 

[Chorus x2]

She seemed so familiar the day that I met her 
Who was she foolin' I had a clue what she was doin' 
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention 
I fell in her game I'm so lost 
Please stop the rain 

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge x2:]
And when my music stops 
And when my tear drops 
And when the rain ends 
My heart will beat again

[Chorus x2]

I love you 
I will never do the things she did 
Take my heart and run away with it oh no 
'Cause I really really love you

[Repeat chorus till the end]
