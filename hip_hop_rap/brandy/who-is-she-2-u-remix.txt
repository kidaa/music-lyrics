Don't even think about calling me crazy. You know you peeped that lady Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah Yeah. Then when I turned
and looked at you, you tried to play it off. But I could tell that you 2 were friends. 
She was just too nervous. And she was looking like she was hurt. Like a memory had surfaed. It kinda got her pissed. I'm
kinda wondering myself and you're really no help to me. How you 2 know each other so well? Cause I wanna know now. You
better start talking...
