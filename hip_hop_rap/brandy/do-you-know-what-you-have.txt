[Intro:]
They say you don't know when you're losing a good thing
Until it's gone
And I sometimes think to myself
Does he know?

[Verse 1:]
Now all I hear you saying is don't stop
Did, did you forget that
What's that look on your face?
Are you surprised?
You act like you can't believe this
Gon and lay your head back what
While I set it off what
What you thinking bout what
Is it me or her? what
You say you'll never leave what
I ain't insecure what
What you yelling for
Already

[Chorus: x4]
Do you know what you got here do you know

[Verse 2:]
I don't think you recognize
Love
I'm certified ride or die
Trust
Why do I have to ask what
Is it good enough what
Don't you see in me what
What I'm committed for what
Take a bullet for ya what
If I had to what
Take my heart from me might point it at you

[Chorus: x4]
Do you know what you got here do you know

[Bridge:]
If you forgot what's
Waiting here
When you change your mind but
You're free to go
Just do me a favor
Leave your keys on the table
If you forgot what
The way this feels
When you changed your mind boy
You're free to go
Yeah yeah
Does he know?

[Chorus: x4]
Do you know what you got here do you know
