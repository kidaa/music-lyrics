[VERSE 1]
I know that it's late
And maybe I shouldn't be so into you
It's just that tonight
I am so taken, I've fallen for you
When I look in your eyes I can see
A million possibilities
And I know you'll be leaving me soon
But tonight
[CHORUS]
Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you baby
I will be good to you
And we can try
To forget tomorrow 
And make it last forever tonight
[VERSE 2]
So if you must go
Know that I'll be missing you, wishing you closer
So let's make the most of these
Moments together, we'll never forget
And it's breaking my heart 'cause I know
That tomorrow you'll be miles away
And I catch myself wanting so much more
Tonight
[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
So if youre leaving me now
Baby I don't know how
I will ever get over you
Because you opened my eyes
To this love that's inside
Oh baby, don't ever, ever leave me
[CHORUS out]
