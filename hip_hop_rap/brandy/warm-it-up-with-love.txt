
Warm it up with love [6x]
Said we gotta warm this up with love 

Only bout a day left till the world falls apart 
Wishin' we could press restart, feeling like it's time for change 
Gotta be a reason why we loose our minds, 
everyone's wrong but everyones right. 
Tell me why we make it, so complicated, what are we gonna do 

Can't let go when I fall 
Can't hang up, over call, when we feel so alone 
Everyone's watching me 
And I pray when you bleed, I love when you love, I cry when you cry 

[Chorus:]
That's the reason why I'm turning up this song for freedom 
It was up to believe it, cause the whole world is freezing 
Need to warm it up with love 
I've got so many reasons for the thruth that I'm speaking 
And the hope we can see, we need to warm it up with love 

Warm it up with love [7x]
Said we got to warm it up with love 

Running out of time and the game clock is winding down 
Tell me how we turn that ground, searching through the lost and found 
looking for hope 
What if we wake and the sun don't shine no more 
Everybody locks that door 
Tell me why we make it, so complicated 
What are we gonna do 

[Repeat chorus]

Warm it up with love [7x]
Said we got to warm it up with love 

[Bridge:]
It's like the pendant is broken, class act this place I'm hopin' 
We make it out alive, downside its looking better 
I need some help, I want it, strong enough to do this for me 
There's nobody here but us 

And that's why I'm turning up this song for freedom 
It was up to believe it, cause the whole world is freezing 
Need to warm it up with love 
I've got so many reasons for the thruth that I'm speaking 
And the hope we can see, we need to warm it up with love 

Warm it up with love [7x]
Said we got to warm this up with love
