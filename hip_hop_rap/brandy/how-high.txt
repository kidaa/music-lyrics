[Verse 1]
Remember back when I gave you my day time number, number, number, number. 
Like I known you all my life but were perfect strangers, strangers, strangers, strangers. 
Now I feel connected to you like a rib I'm one within you. 
We're unbreakable, unbreakable, inseparable, inseparable. 
So when 

[Chorus:]
When you say jump, Ill say how high, how high, how high, I want to touch the sky. 
Im so high. 
When you say jump, Ill say how high, how high, how high, I want to touch the sky. 
Im so high. 

[Verse 2]
Remember back when you took me to meet your mother, mother, mother, mother. 
She said she thought you found out the perfect lover, lover, lover, lover. 
Now I feel connected to you like a rib I'm one within you. 
We're unbreakable, unbreakable, inseparable, inseparable. 
So when 

[Repeat Chorus]

I think I knew you before I met you its dj vu. 
I fancy you, now I'm rocking you with my Jimmy Choo's.
This is your debut, you know you that dude. 
Im keeping you like my house on the hill in Malibu. 
Them other niggas is old news like old school. 
You keep me BranNu, You are my soul school. 
I love your smell I think youre so cute. 
And where you been up in with them last few. 
Baby you past due. 
I know youll never hurt me. 
You love is bulletproof. 
I want to marry you, want to mother another you. 
You know you got the sweetest taboo. 
You got me doing what I oughta do. 
Baby cause Im in love with you. 
Let's stay together like rhythm and blues. 
Cause me without you is a refuse.
You know I need you. 
I gotta see you like a point of view. 
Cause youre internal like the revenue. 
Never will be another you.

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
