
Oooohh oh

[Verse 1:]
You just came into my world
A little boy without a girl
You just smiled at me
I knew it was on
We spent weeks that were a blur
We made love so sweet and pure
Then I looked, you were gone

[Bridge:]
Where's this man I've come to know
With the heart I thought was gold?
You just turned me out and walked out the door
How could you just be so cold?
What a hard and heavy blow
Now I'm lying here alone on the floor

[Chorus:]
Are you in another place?
Or behind another face?
Where are you now?
Are you just a mental case?
Or did you just slip into an empty space?
Where are you now?

[Verse 2:]
I've searched inside my soul
For the reasons never told
And what bothers me is that you know
You should have told me from the start
Instead of playing with my heart
But you left me here with nothing to hold

[Bridge:]
So I'm taking it easy
I cleared my head
I've cried me a river
Said some prayers
But I often wonder
When I'm in my bed
Where are you now?
Hey...

[Chorus:]
Are you in another place?
Or behind another face?
Where are you now?
Are you just a mental case?
Or did you just slip into an empty space?
Where are you now?
