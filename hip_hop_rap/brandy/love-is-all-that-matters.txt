from ABC's telefilm Double Platinum 

[Brandy]
Sometimes we make each other cry 
Sometimes we're locked inside the prison's of our pride, oh yeah 
Sometimes we break our hearts with the words we say 
Let anger get in the way too many times 

But always after all, love 
Love is all that matters, love 
After everything one thing remains the same 
One thing we cannot change, oh 

We all have one heart, love 
And one heart needs another 
'Cause love, love is all that matters 
Love is all that matters 

[Brandy   Diana Ross] 
It matters after all, oh oh 

[Diana Ross] 
Sometimes we search this world for gold 
When all we really need is just a hand to hold 
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip 
With the words we forget to say too many times 

[Brandy   Diana Ross] 
But always after all, love 
Love is all that matters hey... {hey} 
After everything one thing remains the same 
One thing we cannot change, hey...{No} 

We all, we all have one heart, love 
And one heart needs another 
'Cause love is all that matters 
Love is all that matters It matters after all 

[Brandy]
After all that we've been through 
[Diana Ross] 
It comes down to just me and you 
[Brandy   Diana Ross] 
You need me and I need you 

'Cause love is all that matters {Love is all that matters} 
Love is all that matters {Love is all that matters} 
That only thing that matters {Oh} 

Love is all that matters 
The only thing that matters 
It matters after all Oh...{Oh}
