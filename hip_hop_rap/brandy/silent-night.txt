
I can't see you, but I can feel you
And I like to see you right there
And I remember, back in December
You left me standing right here

Seems like yesterday we were one
Now there's no shoulder to lean on
You're never coming back, your love's so far gone
Forever all alone

It was a silent night, another lonely night

I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no
I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no
It was a silent night, another lonely night

I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no

I wish this fly on this wall
Tell me where did we go wrong
Is there a bigger picture
That my eyes didn't capture
Or was it that I loved too strong?

Seems like yesterday we were one
Now there's no shoulder to lean on
You're never coming back, your love's so far gone
Forever all alone

It was a silent night, another lonely night

I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no
I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no
It was a silent night, another lonely night

When you looked me in my eye
Baby when you said goodbye
The salty tears I cried
And now I'm suicidal
But I'm my daughter's idol
If not for her I would've died
Did you ever love me or did you
Use me for the light I gave you?
Now I'm emptying out my bed
In an empty room

It was a silent night, another lonely night

I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no
I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no
It was a silent night, another lonely night

I can't believe you left me [x3]
Oh no... OH NOOO
