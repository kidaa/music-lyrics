Brandy got to make it hot  
LL Cool J got to make it hot  
Uh, Brandy got to make it hot  
LL Cool J got to make it hot  
Uh real love is hard to maintain 
Drama people try to make it reign  
Word to Marduke boo there  
Ain't no substitute naw  
The brothers wanna buy your lovin' with loot 
I represent something ginuwine  
Scoop you up in my arms in the nick of time  
Willy style keep my love flowing like tha Nile  
This here's real major exhale then tap me on my pager 

[Brandy]
Seems like ever since 
The first day we met 
There is no one else 
I think of more than you 
Can't seem to forget 
Can't get you out of my head 
Guess the verdict's in 
I'm crazy over you 
How can one be down 
Tell me where to start 
Cause everytime you smile I feel tremors in my heart 
I have but one concern 
How can I get with you 
Til my day comes here's what I'm gonna doCheck it 

chorus
Sittin' up in my room  
Back here thinkin' about you 
I must confess I'm a mess for you 
Sittin' up in my room 
Back here thinkin' about you 
I'm just a mess with a thing for you 

[LL Cool J] 
Peace uhh You know what I mean  
Yeah yeah got to blaze the joint baby  
It's tha butters uhh it's all sugary  
The flava don't cease when I'm in tha cut boo  
I pull tha silk out tha crease  
ohhh ten fingers swingin' the tension get released  
Tell you girlfriends chill I ain't no dog on a leash 
Roof I keep it true so who gonna get who  
Sprung cause Waiting to Exhale collapses lungs  
I make it hard for your ex to feel tha full effects 
I treat my honey good and that's what he don't expect 
Who's next not me I'm dedicated  
I never send my girl outside frustrated  
That's tha truth beavers cant break down the code  
I wrote my own book I call it Waiting to Explode  

[Brandy]
Sittin' up in my room  
Back here thinkin' about you 
I must confess I'm a mess for you 
Sittin' up in my room 
Back here thinkin' about you 
I'm just a mess with a thing for you

Second time Brandy sings:

Turn my heart around am I making ground  
Tell me what is up I say I need to know tell me
