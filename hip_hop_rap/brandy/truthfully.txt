
How could she ever fool around 
Don't know what she was thinking 'bout 
While you were giving love 
She let you down 
Boy I know that you want to be alone 
Cause she broke your heart 
And she sent you home 
And you're wondering why 
She was so cold 
Well when they lie 
They have to lie again 
Cause the lying never ends 
So... 

Truthfully 
Even if you don't believe 
You will always hear the truth 
Come from me 
Baby I'll never lie 
AAnd you're the reason 
I will always tells the truth 
Cause the truth resides in me 

Boy I know it's a crying shame 
Baby no no you shouldn't blame 
Yourself for what she did 
She was insane 
Maybe where you go I will go 
Whatever makes you happy 
Let me know 
My heart will be right there 
To console you 
Maybe the lies will never begin 
I will be your lover, your best friend 
So... 

Truthfully 
Even if you don't believe 
You will always hear the truth 
Come from me 
Baby I'll never lie 
AAnd you're the reason 
I will always tells the truth 
Cause the truth resides in me 

I will never say goodbye 
And I don't want to see you cry 
God only knows I love you 
But it's written in my eyes 
You are the only one for me 
There's no way I could ever leave 
I would never, no never never lie to you 
Truthfully
