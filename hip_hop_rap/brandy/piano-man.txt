Do you have a request book handy, I can flip through 
I do, he said my name is Rodney, good to meet you 
What do you wanna hear tonight he asked me 
He says that I can feel inside 
I've got what you need know exactly, why don't we give this a try 

[Chorus:]
Play me a song about heartache, I promise I can sing every word 
Play me a song about love lost, that's another one everyone's heard 
Strike up the band 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 

Play a song for us Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for love Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for us Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for love Mr. Piano Man 

He played a song filled with sadness, I believed him 
Even though, we're strippin with madness, I could see it 
We were lost in the music, everyone knew it 
Truth was in the air tonight I could see all the faces, they thought the same 
Won't you please...... 

Play me a song about heartache, I promise I can sing every word 
Play me a song about love lost, that's another one everyone's heard 
Strike up the band 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight Mr. Piano Man 

Play a song for us Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for love Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for us Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for love Mr. Piano Man 

[Bridge:]
He was going for hours, people crying showers 
No one ever really telled how it is 
I sang about hopeless cause everyone knows it, knows it 
And it was so honest 
Finally breathing some clean air, been through it and seen there 
I put my star to fame 
Now the spotlight was faiding, he just kept on playing 

Play me a song about heartache, I promise I can sing every word 
Play me a song about love lost, that's another one everyone's heard 
Strike up the band 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight 
We can have the whole world singing tonight Mr. Piano Man 

Play a song for us Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for love Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for us Mr. Piano Man 
Play a song for love Mr. Piano Man
