[Verse 1:]
Turn the lamp on
Let me talk to ya
See that light bulb
Does something to ya
Makes it little harder
To tell a lie don't it
Make it difficult
To run and hide don't it
Tell the truth to me
The truth to me
Come close to me
If that's you
I wanna see the details
Inside those beautiful eyes
Beautiful eyes

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

[Chorus:]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 2:]
Turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb took something from me
Gave something to me
I can't decide [x2]
I took freedom
Gave purpose
Can't blame him to perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

[Chorus:]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful

[Bridge:]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Whos the fairest of them all
Mirror mirror oh your so
Unfair to all of the beautiful ones ohhh

[Chorus:]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me [x4]
I'm scared to be beautiful
Beautiful [x3]...
