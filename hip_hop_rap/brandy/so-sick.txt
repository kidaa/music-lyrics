[Intro: Ad-libs]

[Verse 1:]
I'm sick cause it's 4 in the morning
And I'm sick cause I ain't heard from him
I done seen this flick before
G-g-g-gave him plenty warning
He said he wouldn't do it a-gain
You know my heart keeps telling me it's gon stop
Now there's a knock but the dead bolts lock
My-my-my conscious saying
You can do better girl
Cause right now he ain't ready
But the other side of my head side is saying
That I might not find no better

So when he a-a-ask just how could you love somebody so ooh
This feeling this question I asked still been unanswered
But is so ooh ooh so many
Yeah e yeah

[Chorus:]
Sick
When you take him back every time
Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick
When you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go
Cause you just can't help it
Cause the only left to do is cry
Cause deep inside
It makes you so sick
Ooh [x8]
Don't sometimes it makes you so
Sick
Ooh [x8]
Don't sometimes it makes you so
Sick

[Verse 2:]
Of course hes calling me it's 8:10
In the morning
But I ain't gon be late for work again
I can't afford this
I'm pulling off he pulls up pulls up
There's something he wanna discuss
I'm telling him last night I was all ears
But he was no where to be found
Told him last time that he made me feel this way
I wasn't gon be the one going back on my word
I was just gon let it end
Cause obviously conversing ain't working for me and you
Now I'm back home in the bed missing the hell out of you

[Chorus:]
Sick
When you take him back every time
Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick
When you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go
Cause you just can't help it
Cause the only left to do is cry
Cause deep inside
It makes you so sick
Ooh [x8]
Don't sometimes it makes you so
Sick
Ooh [x8]
Don't sometimes it makes you so
Sick

[Bridge:]
Oh how far
Can you tell me how far
Does someone have to push you for them to recognize
They pushed you over the line
The line [x2]
Baby
How far
Baby how far
Do you think I'm gonna let you push me
Before I cross the line
Before I cross the line

[Chorus:]
Sick
When you take him back every time
Cause the love is so amazing
And it makes you so sick
When it makes you go and compromise
Everything you said the night before
You wouldn't do ooh
Sick
When you love him more than you love yourself
You can't let go
Cause you just can't help it
Cause the only left to do is cry
Cause deep inside
It makes you so sick
Ooh [x8]
Don't sometimes it makes you so
Sick
Ooh [x8]
Don't sometimes it makes you so
