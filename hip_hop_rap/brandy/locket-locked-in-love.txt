[Verse 1:]
I here the rain drops
Fall on my rag top
And come down the windshield of my car
Parked on the same lane
We came a get away
And trade our kisses after dark

[Bridge:]
You were everything I want bad
Everything I'm gonna need bad
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I could'nt get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
And I'm alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love
So locked in love
And I gotta get free

[Verse 2:]
I feel the clouds start to form
In my mind but
Rain starts to pure then lust my eyes
Maybe there's one who's heart is worth
Wanting you than the one you left behind
By throwing my quarters out
Into the water I wish that you'd meet me here
Like you use to
A heart in a mind we share
How could you take your half
And oh no but it would never be the same

[Bridge:]
You were everything I want bad
Everything I'm gonna need bad
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I gotta get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
And I'm alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love
And I gotta get free Ohhhh

[Verse 4:]
My baby's gone
The vault is closed
My heart is closed
And still I'm alone
Sometimes I here my heart beating beating

[Chorus x2]

My hearts bleeding so freely
Won't you set me free

My hearts bleeding so freely
Won't you set me free
