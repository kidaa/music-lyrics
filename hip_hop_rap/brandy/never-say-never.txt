
Who would ever thought a guy 
Would want a girl like me 
Who would ever thought that I 
Would fall so easily 
Who would ever thought that we 
Would finally come to be 
I guess they don't know 
How much you mean to me 
Who would ever thought that they 
Would have some words to say 
We'll go on anyway 
It's alright - it's okay 
Take whatever comes our way 
Together we will stay 
I got three words to say 
Never say never 

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness 
By trying to pull us down with such a mess 
Why can't they let us live just like the rest 
And keep us out of all this crazy madness 
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame 
That all they do is sit and think my name 
When all that i do mainly 
Sit and think about my baby and me 

Now baby they can't believe that 
You and me are together 
That's why they should have never 
Never said never 
There were times when we thought that 
You and me could never be together 
That's why we should have never 
Never said never 

Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' round 
About the way me and you are gettin' down 
What are they jealous are they hatin' me 
I guess they all have their own Ph.Ds 
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me 
Stop tryin' to get the best of me 
No matter what they say baby 
We gotta move on cause we're gonna be happy 

We didn't let the thoughts that we had 
We didn't let the words that they said 
Keep us from the love we now have 
Never say never 
Simply for me to see when 
Never would've been never if allowed 
Now that we are together 
Never say never
