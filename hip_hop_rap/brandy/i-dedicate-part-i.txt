Yo yo what's up B? 
[Brandy] 
What's up bro, how ya doin'?

[Fuzzy] 
What's up yo, yo I'm alright 
You know this is the last day of the album

[Brandy] 
Sweet but just don't think it's complete 
Until I dedicate a song 
To the people who inspired me to sing 
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Fuzzy] 
Yeah right well all you gotta do 
Is what inspired you to sing

[Brandy] 
Well my daddy he taught me everything I know 
My little brother Ray J. he taught me a lot of moves 
And my mom she gots the tongue you see? 
Whitney Houston that's my mentor all the way 
And Aretha Franklin much respect to her 
Stevie Wonder, umm who else? 
Anthony, Grady, Lil' Grady and Terry

[Fuzzy]
Tear it up

[Brandy]
Jeff, Nyesha, Shena 
This is for y'all

Ooh, when I was and I was listening to you 
Your voice gave me inspiration 
That's when I knew that I wanted to sing 
For the world, was my motivation, hey

I dedicate to you 
This song's for you 
I give you my voice 
This song's for you
