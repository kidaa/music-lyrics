
How would I loose myself in love, yeaahh 
Let you have me completely, yeah yeah 
If I give u all my trust, 
Can I just let me go, can I not be afraid 
To let you find my way 

When you find someone that means so much to you 
Giving all you got is easy to do 

Just fall, don't be afraid 
Fall, to stammer my way, fall, to stammer my fate 
Fall, it will be ok, Fall, no other way 
Fall Just Fall in love 

Just fall, don't be afraid 
Fall, to stammer my way, fall, to stammer my fate 
Just, fall, it will be ok, Fall, no other way 
Fall, fall in love [x2]

I have waited to fall 
Fall [x9]

So I find myself right here 
About to lean over the edge 
In your arms I feel no fear 

There is no safer place than here in your embrace 
So catch me lest I fall 

Just fall, don't be afraid 
Fall, to stammer my way, fall, to stammer my fate, 
Just fall, it will be ok, Fall, no other way 
Fall Just Fall in love [x2]

Just fall, don't be afraid 
Fall, to stammer my way, Fall, to stammer my fate 
Fall, it will be ok, Fall, no other way 
Fall Just Fall in love [x2]

Fall [Repeat x8]
