Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend 
A helping hand you lend, in my time of need so I 
I'm calling you now, just to make it through 
What else can I do, don't you hear my please 
Friends may come and friends may go

But you should know that 
I've got your back, it's automatic 
So never hesitate to call 
Cuz I'm your sister and always for ya and I

[CHORUS:]
I don't know what I'd ever do without you 
From the beginning to the end 
You've always been here right beside me 
So I'll call you my best friend 
Through the good times and the bad ones 
Whether I lose or If I win 
I know one thing that never changes and 
That's you as my best friend

Whenever I'm down 
With all that's going on, It's really going on 
Just one of those days 
You say the right thing, to keep me moving 
To keep me going strong, what else can I say

Friends are there through thick and thin 
Well I've been told that 
And I believe that it's automatic 
Call me when you need a friend 
Cuz I'm your sister and always for ya and I don't know

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x]

I'll be there for you 
When you're going through, 
wouldn't you be my friend 
Friend you can count on me 
Call me when you need me

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x]
