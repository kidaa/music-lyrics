
We started off so good 
We were honestly happy 
You used to tell me, I was beautiful 
Where did it all go wrong? 
I can't believe 
There's nothin left for saving 
How'd it go... 
From being in love to alone 
It's like swimming on forever but it's moving us downstream 
We can't win together we're no longer the same team 
So you can watch my great escape tonight 

Make me wonder... 
What's the use of all this? 
What else can we call this 
Such a complicated love 
Make me wonder.. 
What's the point in crying 
Passed the point of trying 
I'm afraid that there's no saving us 

Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
Nobody can save us now 
Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
Nobody can save us now 
We're drowning 

Right when you walk inside 
No hello when u see me 
You're on the phone talking to your boys 
We don't even speak 2 words 
I like a chose 
To get a "hey baby" from you... 
I don't know, what happen to you and I... 
Wooooh.. 
I don't want to be the one living with regrets 
Thought about it finally I'm taking my deep breath 
Before I step outside you tonight 

Make me wonder 
What's the use of all this? 
What else can we call this 
Such a complicated love 
Make me wonder.. 
What's the point in crying? 
Passed the point of trying 
I'm afraid that there's no saving us 

Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
Nobody can save us now 
Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
Nobody can save us now 
We're drowning 

I can't find the raft to keep this love afloat 
Where did it go? 
There's no need for searching or rescue 
No more, no more 
It's so long for hope 
It's wondedup for the shore 
Baby, it's time that we both move on 
Cuz we've been drowning now for too long 

Make me wonder 
What's the use of all this? 
What else can we call this 
Such a complicated love 
Make me wonder.. 
What's the point in crying 
Passed the point of trying 
I'm afraid that there's no saving us 

Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
Nobody can save us now 
Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
Baby, I can't be your lifeguard 
we're drowning 
I can't be your lifeguard 
Nobody can save us now 
We're drowning
