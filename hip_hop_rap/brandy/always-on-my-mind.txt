Oooh...

[1] - Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

Everyday I see you
With loving eyes
I just wanna hold you
And make you mine
If you listen to me now sweet baby
I'll make a promise that you can hold me to

[2] - No matter how far
And no matter how wide
I promise baby that I'll stay by your side
Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is what I'm thinking of

[Repeat 1]

It's the way you look at me
The sight of you knock me off of my feet
I want to kiss and tell
And get to know you well
Let me introduce my heart to you

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1 2x]

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1 till end]
