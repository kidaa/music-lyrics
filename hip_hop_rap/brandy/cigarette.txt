
It's so obvious, wasn't good enough.
Deep down I could feel this wasn't really love but lust.
Now I'm back to dust, thoughts of self-destruct, crying like a dumb, miss you as fucked up as it was.

Never say what you wanna do because in love you become a fool.
Can't deny I'm blinded by a devil in disguise. 

So I'm taking shots to the head, and after that you can catch me smoking on a cigarette 'cause you left.

Still crazy in love, can't let go of us.
Boy, you got a hold on me like glue, you got me stuck.
Love is like a drug and I didn't get enough and I still make believe that you were my diamond in the rough.

Never say what you wanna do 'cause in love you become a fool.
Can't deny, I'm blinded by a devil in disguise.

So I'm taking shots to the head, and after that you can catch me smoking on a cigarette 'cause you left.
Taking shots to the head, and after that you can catch me smoking on a cigarette 'cause you left.

No turning back, no turning back.
Moving forward, like a train, I'm moving onward

Taking shots to the head, and after that you can catch me smoking on a cigarette 'cause you left.
Taking shots to the head, and after that you can catch me smoking on a cigarette 'cause you left.

Taking shots to the head, and after that you can catch me smoking on a cigarette 'cause you left.
