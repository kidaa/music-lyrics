Is there a problem? 
That you can't solve, whoa 
You're all alone 
And no one wants to get involved 

But I have a friend 
He'll always be around be around 
And He'll never leave you 
He will never let you down 

1 - All He said He wants from you 
All He said you have to do 
Give Me you 
All He said He wants from you 
All He said you have to do 
Give Me you 

You're always saying 
That love is such a heavy burden 
You need someone in your life 
Who will give more loving than hurting 

He'll never forsake you 
He will always be around be around 
And he'll never leave you 
He will never let you down 

Repeat 1 

You can call Him in the morning 
You can call Him in the noonday 
You can call Him in the evening 
Give Him you 
You can call Him in the morning 
You can call Him in the noonday 
You can call Him in the evening 
Give Him you 
Give Him you....
