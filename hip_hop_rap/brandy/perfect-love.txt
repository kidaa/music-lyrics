
Giving me everything, dont know why but it seems
The more you come around the more I feel lonely
You always stood right by me, yet my life is incomplete
The harder you try the more I feel guilty
cause you cant satisfy my love when your best is not enough
Even though they say you were meant for me

They think Im crazy

[Chorus:]
But Ill keep on waiting for the perfect love
cause I believe its gotta be
Deep as an ocean the kind of emotion that turns you inside out
That leaves no doubt
That its more than a feeling its love that would really change my world
Im just a simple girl looking for love 

love love love love...

There aint nothing wrong with you
And I love how you wear your cool
Sometimes I wish I could learn how to love you
Maybe I had an easier time to find the ones I broke their lives 
You could lose someone that loves you and end up all alone
cause I dont know that true love exist if its just a fantasy at best
But something inside of me tells me theres gotta be more

You think Im crazy

[Chorus:]

You say all we need is time, but time still hasnt change my mind
If I dont feel it by now when will it ever be right?

Dont think Im crazy

[Chorus:]

love love love love...
Im just a simple girl looking for love
