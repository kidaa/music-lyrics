[Verse 1]
I'm Standing On The Edge Of The Industry
Wondering If It's All That Important To Me
To Get My Records Back Out There On The Street
It Ain't Like I'm Hurting Or Anything
I'm To The Point Right Now My Money Ain't An Issue
I Can Go Where I Want
Do What I Want To Do
Too Tempted To Leave It In My Rearview
Because This Game Ain't What I'm Used To

[Chorus]
Should I Go?
Should I Stay?
I'm In Control
Either Way
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
There Used To Be A Few Artists At A Time
Now Even The Veterans Waiting In Line
Premature Release Of These Albums Of Mine
Making It Hard For Real Entertainers To Shine
If You Manage To Defeat These Odds Against You
Keep Doing Your Thing Cuz I'm Not Mad At You
Just Trying To Figure Out Where I Fit Into
All Of This Now Or If I Do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This Industry Was More Like A Different World
When It Was Just Me, Monica, And Baby Girl, Aaliyah
I Never Got To Tell You How Much You Mean
I Wish You and Me Both Were Sittin' Here Working With Tim
Just To Be In The Presence Of The People That You Affected
The Personal Level Just Makes Me Stop For A Second
[Breath]
You Were Such A Blessing
You Helped Me Answer All My Questions

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well I Gave You Some Time And I Made Up My Mind
Move Over This Is My Time
B-Rock Is Back On The Grind

[Chorus]
