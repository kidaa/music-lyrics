
I'm feeling things I can't explain inside me
It started when I looked into your eyes
Searched my life to find a heart as pure as mine
It's hard to believe it's taken so long for me to find you

[Chorus]
This must be love
You're the one I trust
I could never give this up
You mean everything to me
Touched my heart and soul deeply

I really feel like this is been worth waiting for
This experience is all I need and more
The way you listen to me
Makes me know how much you care
And now I'm falling for you
And now I know you are the one

There were times I gave up
Gave up on everything
I..I never felt someone would care
My life is better cause now you're here with me
I cherish the days so this must be love

[Chorus]

Day and night I'm thinking about you
All I do I do it for you
You've become a part of me
Promise you'll stay
For the 1st time I know dreams come true
Cannot believe that it is you
It's so overwhelming
Can't fight this feeling and you can't deny 

[Chorus x2]
