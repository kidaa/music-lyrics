[Intro]
When you feel your hearts guarded,
And you see the breaks starting,
When the clouds are far departed,
You'll be right here with me,

[Darkchild & Brandy]
B rock...
Darkchild..
We back..
You'll be right here with me

[Bridge]
You'll be right here with me
oh, oh [x16]
You'll be right here with me

[Verse 1]
When your life is going to fast,
off the train tracks
I can slow it down, oh
just when you think your bout to turn back
scared you might crash
I'll be your ground, oh

[Chorus]
Oh when you feel your hearts guarded,
And you see the brakes started,
And when the clouds above Departed,
You'll be right here with me,
And when your tears are dry from crying,
And when the worlds turned silent,
So when the clouds above Departed,
You will be right here with me,
Oh oh [Repeat x10]

I will be right here with you
you'll be right here with me
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
When your trapped and there's just no key,
And you can't breathe,
I breathe for you,
The fire's got you down on both knees,
And the walls are closing in but I will,
Break it through,
And when you feel alone,
I'm a be at home,
Whenevers comes and go,
You know I got you,

[Chorus]
Oh when you feel your hearts guarded,
And when you see the brakes started,
And when the clouds above Departed,
You'll be right here with me,
You'll see the sun
And when your tears are dry from crying, crying,
And when the worlds turned silent...silent,
So when the clouds above Departed,
You will be right here with me,

[Bridge]

I will be here right beside you,
Every step you take yea,
I will be your strength your shelter,
Shield you from the rain,
[Repeat]

[Chorus]
oh when you feel,
oh when you feel your hearts guarded,
and when you see the brakes started,
and when the clouds above Departed,
you'll be right here with me right here,
and when your tears are dry from crying,
and when the worlds turned silent,
so when the clouds above Departed,
you will be right here with me,

I will be right here with you,
You'll be right here with me,
