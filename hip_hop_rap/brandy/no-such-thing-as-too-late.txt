I know you think I be trippin
Thinkin I be playing you be sayin Im aint into you.
Just take a second to listen
Cause I aint into laying with just anybody
Baby I aint trying to give my body so soon

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let me know you're worth it
Do you deserve a chance to
To touch, to feel my love
Cause aint nobody perfect
Underneath the surface can you
Show me your love

[Chorus:]
And when its time
I wont even have to tell you so
You see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
Cause love aint got no where to go
It ll be way better if we wait
Cause theres no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
Cause theres no such thing as too late

You told me you're different
You be always saying you aint nothing like them other dudes
Im judging from my intuition Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You seem like somebody I could probably give myself to
Not so soon.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cause I want you to love me
Whenever you get that chance to
To touch, to feel my love
Cause aint nobody
Cause aint nobody perfect underneath the surface
Can you show me your love

[Chorus:]
And when its time
I wont even have to tell you so
You see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
Cause love aint got no where to go
It ll be way better if we wait
Cause theres no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
Cause theres no such thing as too late

[Bridge:]
Listen to my heart
And Ill listen to yours
And if they say the same thing
Then Ill know were ready

But until then we should be patient lets not start
But when we start, I promise you gon love it baby

[Chorus:]
And when its time
I wont even have to tell you so
You see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
Cause love aint got no where to go
It ll be way better if we wait
Cause theres no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait dont ya think
Cause theres no such thing as too late
