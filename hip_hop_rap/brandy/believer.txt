
Put your hands up
Everybody put your hands up
Put your hands up

[1st Verse]
The worlds so cold and my
own damn hart is making fun of me
Don't need a miracle to see
tomorrows right in front of me
I'm on my own, and
nobody knows who we
can come to be
So come along, you never
know the weak is set free

[Bridge and Chorus]
Now I close my eyes, and I
run to you aah
Cant close my heart, cuz I
know the truth aah
Cuz I'm a believer
We need a believer
Know I gotta believe aah
Any believe aah
Cuz I'm a believer
[2x] I'm a believer
[2x] we need a believer

[2nd Verse]
Is there one so bold, I
would raise a hand and
join a good fight
There's a legend told,
someone's gonna show us
what it looks like
Cuz if you are there, you
never know who it could be
You could come or hold
and lead us to love that
we believe

[Bridge and Chorus]
Then I close my eyes and I run to you
Can't close my heart cuz I know the truth
Cuz I'm a believer
We need a believer
Know I gotta believe aah
Any believe aah
Cuz I'm a believer
[2x] I'm a believer
[2x] we need a believer

[Chorus]
Cuz I'm a believer
We need a believer
Know I gotta believe aah
Any believe aah
Cuz I'm a believer
[2x] I'm a believer
[2x] we need a believer
