
No one can take your place, no way
No one else can come close
If you ask me, yes I do say
You're the only one for me
You pick me up when I fall down ooh yeah
And everything I do is for you
And even though I know you tell me lies
And every time you talk to me I hear

Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again
Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again

No one can take your place, no way
My heart belongs to you,
If you ask me for my hand and Ill say I do
Coz you're the only one for me
You pick me up when I fall down ooooh yeah
And everything I do is for you
And even though I know you tell me lies
And every time you talk to me I hear

Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again
Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again

When you don't talk to me
You don't say nothing
It sounds so good anyway
When you don't talk to me
You don't say nothing
It sounds so good anyway

When you don't talk to me
Just say, say, say it again
Just say, say, say it again

Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again
Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again

Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again
Sweet nothings in my ear
Its so clear,
Just say, say, say it again
