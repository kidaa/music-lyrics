[First Verse]
I'm sittin' home on a cold day
Underneath the covers like a little baby
Think I wanna hear some Coldplay
Especially that song when the man says

[Bridge]
'Did I drive you away?'
I know what you'll say
Oh I know
I know all about your ways
What you do
When you're gone
And I knew
All along
And they say people change
So I, tried to look the other way

[Chorus 2x]
I tried to be blind to your game
deep down I knew you wouldn't stay around
Shoulda left your side in the first place
But I thought I'd be cool

[Second Verse]
All I can see is yo-ur face
Givin' my lovin away at some woman's place
Maybe I should get up and go wash my face
Cryin' never kept you at home anyway

[Bridge]
Did I drive you away? No I didn't but you said it
I know what you'll say
Oh I know
I know all about your ways
What you do
When you're gone
And I knew
All along
And they say people change
So I, tried to look the other way

[Chorus]
I tried to be blind to your game Tried to be blind, yeah
Deep down I knew [Deep down I knew, inside oh]
Shoulda left your side in the first place 
But I thought I'd be cool

[Chorus]
I tried to be blind to your game I tried to be blind
Deep down I knew but I knew it, oh oh oh oh
Shoulda left your side in the first place 
But I thought I'd be cool

[Bridge 2]
I noticed it
The calls you get
Leaving the room and shit
And I knew
You had a bitch
I hated it
That's what I get

[Chorus out]
