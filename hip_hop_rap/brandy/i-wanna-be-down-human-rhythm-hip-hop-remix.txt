[Brandy]
Oh yeah ooh yeah 
I would like to get to know if I could be 
The kind of girl that you could be down for 
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me 
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on 

[Mc Lyte] 
Yeah I get exotic with tha malotic tune 
I get hypnotic with tha room but  
You got to put me down soon I flip a sideshow  
If you come my way up down and around even sideways 
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get 
We can go all out I ain't afraid of the sweat 
But yet I bet you got the techniques to freak a girl  
Inside out what's that all aboutoooh yeah 
Can I have some of that you got to put me on 
Word around town is your nine men strong  
I wanna be put on in tha worst way  
Since the first day I think it was a Thursday oh baby 
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in 
Make me wanna ask where tha hell you been  
I like the way you be with all that personality 
But I got flava too you needs to get with me 

[Brandy]
I wanna be down 
With what you're going through

I wanna be down with you 
No matter the time 
Of day or night it's true 
I wanna be down 

[Yo-Yo]
He was born twenty years ago just a pimp toes 
Everyday new clothes look at tha cut cool-toes  
On three got tha heat so bluff it sling' teshies  
Cause it's more than twenty duckets 
Struck it kind of rich now his pockets lookin' straight 
Slam the deese on tha benzo pancake  
By tha gate moms lookin' straight  
With her house she got great  
Loungin' in her new home that's about to state 
I'll be your call mail motel  
You can get it when you want it  
Even though you got chicks all up on you 
It don't matter cause brother you're fly 
I can't lie I've been mackin' daddy from tha corner of my eye  
Now baby bring it on don't be frontin' on your baby boo  
All I wanna is what's up with you  
How can I get with you seems like you got a hold on me  
It must vodoo cause baby I want you 

Repeat Chorus 

[Queen Latifah] 
About yey short about yey tall about so big about so small 
About this length about this width about this flow about this gift  
Instinct leading me right up your alley  
Way skip tha Moet let's chill with some Allazae  
Nuff stress in our day let me massage your mind  
As my mentals start to play a ghetto sauce who you are  
And I'll be your sexual chocolate bar  
And I got to keep it strong for tha cause  
And you got to keep me strong for the toss  
Brother mad at me damn tha family what else could we be  
When no one else understands us but me  
You were the first to tame me uh, Big Tif I'm out 

Repeat Chorus 

[Queen Latifah] 
Hey here we go here we go here go now  
And it's on yeah and you don't  
Stop Brandy is in tha house  
And you don't stop until tha body rock 
Keep it on and you don't stop rock on
