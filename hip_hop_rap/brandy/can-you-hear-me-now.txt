[Verse 1:]
Some things are best left unspoken
Don't waste time with that talk
Just keep that back in motion
It ain't that easy for me to get off
But I can be your guilty pleasure
Just be sure to put it down down down
Yeah I'm ready for whatever
But you gotta make mama proud

And every night your love for my affection
And please believe I'm guaranteed to turn you out
But you just point that thing in my direction
And when I'm almost there I'll start making those sounds

[Chorus:]
Can you hear me now
Am I getting closer
Can you hear me now
Well if not then you're supposed to
Can you hear me now
Ah I can hear you baby
I can see you baby
Ah I can hear you baby
I can see you baby
Ah I can hear you baby
I can see you baby
Can you hear me now

[Verse 2:]
I'm pretty sure that you notice
The swagger in my walk
Just pay attention and focus yeah-eah
Baby you just gotta play your part

And then you can get this treasure
But you gotta dig deeper down down down
When nobody love you better
But you gotta make mama proud

[Chorus: x2]
Can youx hear me now
Am I getting closer
Can you hear me now
Well if not then you're supposed to
Can you hear me now
Ah I can hear you baby
I can see you baby
Ah I can hear you baby
I can see you baby
Ah I can hear you baby
I can see you baby
Can you hear me now
