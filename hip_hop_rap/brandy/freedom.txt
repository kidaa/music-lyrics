
I saw the train coming for me
With the force of a million marching
I felt the eyes of so many,
The whispers and shouts about
My belief in us

I see the cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
That don't scare me
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it all in public
Hold a press conference
To speak about my freedom
My freedom

Just us- Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us- Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us- I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us- Freedom
Just us- Freedom

I flew away this morning, what if I ran away and never came back
And all of the fame means nothing, It's all a game and gladiator just won't win
And I see cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
Don't bring scared to me no no
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it all in public
Hold my head high
I'm a speak about my freedom
My freedom

Just us- Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us- Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us- I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us- Freedom
Just us- Freedom

Free to run on the water
Free to believe free to love
Free to speak that mountain off the ground
I believe in us

Just us- Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us- Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us- I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us- Freedom
Just us- Freedom

My Freedom
My Freedom
My Freedom
Freedom, Freedom
