[Verse 1:]
My baby got a lot to learn
Come here let mama bring you up to speed
A couple of changes,
A couple of things I want to go over
Couple of hours is all I need
So let's get it started

Remember when you're touching all over my body
And kissing and licking up on me
I know you wanna beat it up up
But I'm sorry that ain't really my thing
If you take your time then we can do whatever
Whatchu think we in here for
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
If you gon get the reaction you want

[Chorus:]
Just take it slow-wer
Slower [x4]
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slow-wer
Slower [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Baby wait a minute
Your closer to the ending
Together we gon finish up
You speed racer
Slow down
Nuh uh uh uh uh ooh oooh

Remember when you're touching all over my body
And kissing and licking up on me
I know you wanna beat it up up
But I'm sorry that ain't really my play
If you take your time then we can do whatever
Watchu think we in here for
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
If you gon get the reaction you want

[Chorus:]
Just take it slow-wer
Slower [x4]
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slow-wer
Slower [x4]

[Bridge:]
I got a vision of us
And there's a kiss with every touch
If I let you take control
Boy you better make me feel love
You never had nothin' like this
I'm gonna show you a thing or two
And if you ask we can go all night
Speed racer, go ooh ooh ooh slow

[Chorus:]
Just take it slow-wer
Slower [x4]
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slow-wer
Slower [x4]

Remember when you're touching all over my body
And kissing and licking up on me
I know you wanna beat it up up
But I'm sorry that ain't really my thing
If you take your time then we can do whatever
Whatchu think we in here for
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
If you gon get the reaction you want

Just take it
