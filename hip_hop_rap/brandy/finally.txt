Yo..Yo
This Is A Champion Song
Feel Me
Me And Brandy
We Have Rised To The Occasion
Come On Like This Talk To Them..Oh

[Verse 1]
I Coulda Stayed In That Place Too Long Ah
I Woulda Made It Ok, For You To Me Wrong
I Woulda Played The Role One More Day Day
If I Didn't Hear My Conscience Say Talk To Em
Stop Look Around
Is This Where You Belong
Look At Yourself
Are You Weak? Are You Strong?
I Realize That It's All Up To Me
I Made Myself Happy Come On

[Chorus]
Finally I Walked Away
Never Woulda Seen This Day
Giving up on Those Things That Hurt Me
Made Me Who I Am Today
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
Lookin Back On My Choices Made
I'm Thinking About The Things I Did To Make You Stay
I Wonder Sometimes Why My Love Didn't Turn To Hate
But Then I Hear The Little Voice Inside Me Say
Stop Look Around
Is This Where You Belong
Look At Yourself
Are You Weak? Are You Strong?
I Realize That It's All Up To Me
I Made Myself Happy Come On

[Chorus]

Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be

[Chorus]

Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya

Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
Finally I'm Where I'm Suppose To Be
