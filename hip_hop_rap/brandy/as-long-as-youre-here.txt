Don't let your fear of a broken heart  

1 - Well as long as you're here  
Can we sit together and work it out?  
Well as long as you're here  
Can we sit together and work it out?  

Before you walk out the door  
Give me one minute  
To save this relationship  
It's getting out of hand  
You said some things  
And I said some too  
But to be without you  
I can't understand  
Don't let your fear of a broken heart  
Don't let over rule our love  
Can we just work it out?  

Repeat 1  

I want you to be there for me  
To dry my tears, to calm my fears  
Have I made it clear   
That I want you here with me  
So whatever you want me to do  
Say the word and baby for you  
I'll beg and plead on bended knee  
Oh baby can't you see  
Don't let your fear of a broken heart  
Don't let over rule our love  
Can we just work it out?  

Repeat 1 2x  

Don't let another day go by without us  
Being together, but to be without you  
I don't wanna say goodbye forever  
Let's just work together  

Repeat 1 til end of song
