[Intro:]
It's not hard living inside of a drum
It's not bad bad bad bad
Let's live our lives on the inside of a drum eh
Eh eh eh eh

[Verse 1:]
It was your eyes that gave you up through that stupid disguise
You tryna hide behind that drink and you almost slipped by
I see you there sophisticated ignoring the beat
Your mouth might be closed
But baby listen to your heart and its screaming

[Hook:]
You're one of us
One of those beautiful fools you are
You're one of us
You were born in it so you should live in it

[Chorus:]
Live in a drum whoa
You'll never be in it alone
If you lived in a drum whoa
Right now you'll already be home
Live on live on
The drum life never gets old
Live on live on
The drum life keeps going on

[Verse 2:]
It was a lie when they told you you were stuck here forever
They're all alone
The music's begging to bring us together
You've been away and now you wont dance
Its the only way back to your homeland

[Hook:]
You're one of us
One of those beautiful fools you are
You're one of us
You were born in it so you should live in it

[Chorus:]
Live in a drum whoa
You'll never be in it alone
If you lived in a drum whoa
Right now you'll already be home
Live on live on
The drum life never gets old
Live on live on
The drum life keeps going on

It's not hard living inside of a drum
It's not bad bad bad bad
Let's live our lives on the inside of a drum eh
Eh eh eh eh.. [2x]

[Repeat Chorus till fade..]
