[VERSE 1]
I have a question
Can I takeover our creation of love
Gimme your attention
And give me all of your trust
Let me show you all of me
And additions to me
Rhythm's the strength to our love
So follow baby carefully and I'll be
Everything you want in me and you'll see
What we've been waiting for
[CHORUS]
Please touch me like this baby, do it like this
Please hold me like this hold me
Please love me like this it makes me feel so good
I need you like this
[VERSE 2]
If we goin' start touching each other
We goin' do it like this
I'll tell you where to kiss
And you'll begin to kiss
Baby I know how I feel
So just follow my lead
Don't be afraid, you're at the wheel
And I just wanna ride and enjoy it with you
'Cause I know that you'll enjoy everything I do
Relax and I'll show you
[CHORUS two times]
[BRIDGE]
You plan to be with me
Baby it's alright
Just do right
Let's just be clear on some thing
This is all for you
But there are rules
If you wanna celebrate me
And if you wanna keep me pleased
This is how my love has got to be
So please touch me
[CHORUS out]
