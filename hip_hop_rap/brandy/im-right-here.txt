
The sun stops shining
And the sky starts falling
And the world stops spinning
And I'm right here
I'm right here

Stars stop twinkling
The ocean is dry
The winds stop blowing
And I'm right here
I'm right here

Come what may, come what will
Come whatever, I'll be right here still
So when i get old
The world gets cold
One thing I know is
I'm right here
I'm right here woahh

[Chorus]
No matter what the world decides to throw at me
I'm right here
There is only one thing I can guarantee
I'm right here
Who you can depend on and just where I'll be
I'm right here [x2]

The Fans stop screaming
And the checks stop coming
My records stop selling
And I'm right here
I'm right here
My waist starts cleaving
And all my clothes don't fit no more
But I'm right here
I'm right here yeah

Come what may, come what will
Come whatever, I'll be right here still
So when i get old
The world gets cold
One thing I know is
I'm right here
I'm right here 

[Chorus]

Through my good days
And through my bad days
And in between
When the kingdom is crumbling
I'm still the queen
So at my best or at my worst
Cuz both I've seen
Said it really don't matter
I don't care
Cuz the love's in me

Woah Woah [x3]

No matter what!

[Chorus]

I'm right here, I'm right here
