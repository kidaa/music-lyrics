
Whoa, whoa...
Love, love, love, love...
Love, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Hmmm, oh, hmmm...
Love...
Whoa...
Oh...

Memories of yesterday
Lonliness my way to say
I needed you and all you do
To come and rescue me

The day I saw your face
Everything fell into place
The melody of you and me
The love song that we share

[1] - And they say...
Love isn't love
Until you got someone to share it with
And I got you
And it has made me realize
That love, oh love
Love is something that we take advantage of
Through you I've learned that love is on my side

I try
But the feeling still flows deep inside
It takes my breath away
When it trys to stay
I only love you more

Oh don't try to tell me I'm a fool
I know this is something new
Just let me through
I here to do whatever you want me to

[Repeat 1]

On my side, on my side
Love is on my side

I sit here and wonder why
I can't get you off my mind
A special scent
And all you mean to me
Whoa, it's the love that just won't go away
I hear it in the things you say
I can't ignore I can't ignore
I want you more I want you more
And more and more and more and more

[Repeat 1 till end]
