I don't even know
How it got this way
When I first met you
I never thought your love was true
But I'm glad I saw just what was in store
All the while you plan to be my man
Now I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
You make me happy 
You make me feel so good
With the things you do for me
Oh baby can't you see that 
You make me happy
Make me feel so good
With the things you do for me
Oh baby,baby,baby

In search of happiness 
Tryin' to find someone
Who can make my life so complete baby
If I only knew that someone was you boy
There would have been more happy days
So don't you go away
[Chorus]

No one can make me feel this way
You always seem to brighten up my day
[Chorus]
