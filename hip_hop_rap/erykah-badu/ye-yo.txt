Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo 
Help me 
Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo... 

Sometimes, 
Sometimes I get so lonely, lonely, lonely 
I feel all by myself up here 
That's when I take a minute 
To re-evaluate things 
All of the things I think are special 
Oooh like 
When you wake up in the morning 
And you see the morning sun 
And you need to know the world is on your side 
Who do you run to 
Who can you turn to 
Come on 
Then the evening comes to greet you 
You need someone to hold you close 
And you feel you need to rest your aching mind 
Who can you run to 
Who can you turn to 
Well see the sun's in the east and the moon reflects 
Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest 
If you wanna go to heaven lay up on my breast 
I'm ye yo, you're ye yo 
I say the sun's in the east and the moon reflects 
Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest 
If you wanna go to heaven lay up on my breast 
I'm ye yo, you're ye yo 
Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo.....
