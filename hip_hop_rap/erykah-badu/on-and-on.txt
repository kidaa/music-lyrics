Oh my my my
I'm feeling high
My moneys gone
I'm all alone

The world is turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day whay a day

Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learn,
If your knowledge were your wealth then it will be well earn

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
Whew on and on and on and on
I go on and on and on and on
Ohh on and on and on and on

I was born under water with 3 dollars and 6 dimes
Yeah you might laugh 'cause you did not do your math

Na qua 2..3.
Damn, yall feel that Oh...
Qua 2..3.
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day what a day what a day

The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
I go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think i need a cup of tea, the world keeps burnin'
Oh what a day, what a day what a day

You rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothin' left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is goin' get it
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Ooh ooh wee on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
