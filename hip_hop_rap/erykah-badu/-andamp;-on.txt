A one-one, two one two
On & on & on & on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
Say wait a minute, Queen
What's your name
I be that gypsy
Flippin' life game from the right brain
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a super nova star
She be the light
When they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
Across up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well well I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men

2 fish, 1 swimmin' up stream
1 swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns, smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow, zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling, melinated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this earth
What'

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

Bridge!
I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal

Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material

Cause you did not do your math
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Mad props to god ja born

Things just ain't the same for singers
Gotta sing on the beat the bring us
But that's all I have ain't got no mo
But still the people really wanna to know

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
