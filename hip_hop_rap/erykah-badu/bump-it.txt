Tongue roll stick 'em

Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, 
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah,
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, 

[Chorus]
Push up the fader 
Bust the meter 
Shake the tweeter
Bump it - Well Well Well
Bump it - Well Well [4x]

[Verse 1]
You know I love it when they play my beat real loud
Because it moves the band and then it moves the crowd
You know I love it when they play my sh-t sky high
It puts me in a daze

[Bridge]
And oh--oh--oh--oh
Ooh baby before you bump it
Won't you shake it just a little for me
Oh--oh--oh--oh
Wait a minute for you buss it 
Won't you roll a lickle something for me
And oh--oh--oh--oh
Ooh baby before you bump it
Won't you shake it just a little for me
Oh--oh--oh--oh
Wait a minute for you bump it 
Won't you shake it for me, shake it for me

[Chorus]
Push up the fader 
Bust the meter 
Shake the tweeter
Bump it - Well Well Well
Bump it - Well Well [2x]

[Verse 2]
You know I love it when they play my beat real loud
Because it moves the band and then it moves the crowd
You know I love it when they play my sh-t sky high, high, hiiigh, high 

[Bridge]
Oh, Oh, oh--oh--oh--oh
Ooh baby before you bump it
Can you roll a lickle for me
Oh--oh--oh--oh
Wait a minute for you buss it 
Won't you shake it just little for me
And oh--oh--oh--oh
Ooh baby before you bump it
Can roll a lickle something for me
Oh--oh--oh--oh
Wait a minute for you bump it 
Won't you shake it for me, shake it for me

[Chorus]
Push up the fader 
Bust the meter 
Shake the tweeter
Bump it - Well Well Well
Bump it - Well Well [4x]

Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, 
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah,
