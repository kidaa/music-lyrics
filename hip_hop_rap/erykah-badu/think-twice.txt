Maybe
May be

Maybe we ought to think twice
Before we start something nice
No need to sacrifice the spice in our lives...oh oh oh
Your loves like fire and ice
That's why we ought to think twice baby
No need to sacrifice the spice in our lives...oh oh oh

I really love you
You know I do
I really love you
You know its true

I really love you 
You know I do
I really love you
You know its true

You know I love you baby
You know i do
You know I love you baby
You know I do
Think twice
Think twice
You know I love you baby
You know I do
Think twice 
Think twice
You know I love you baby
You know I do
Think twice
Think twice
I really love you
