I'm from the South 
I'm a Southern Girl 
Home of the burning church 
Don't know much about the world 

Home of the pocket stones 
Home of the booty songs 
Home of the finger wave that lasts 
All night long 

Home of the On   On 
Home of the dominoes 
Home of the two piece and the cat fight 
Home of the teeth is gold 

Home of the never miss 
Home of the platinum hits 
I'm a Southern Girl Southern Girl 

Countryfied
Everything I eat is fried 
Gotta Southern draw 
I'm so country y'all 
Well that's way down South 
Yeah it's way down low 
Check my Southern fried style 
And my Southern flow 
Southern Girl 

Countryfied
I like my Tofu fried 
Got about a hundred friends 
That ain't caught on the trends 
Don't know about the internet 
Don't know about the radio 
Don't know about the television 
All I know is about my flow 
I'm ten-four check me out 
To make money for the house 
Hooked up with my boy Rahzel 
I sure hope the record sales 
Southern Girl 

Southern Girl, and I'll rock your world 
Fly as a bumble bee buzz 
Can't nobody f*** with me 
I'm a Southern Girl 
From way down South 
Got a dirty wave 
Cause I got a dirty mouth, dirty South
