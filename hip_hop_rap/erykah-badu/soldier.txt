And he's on the ball
Never miss a day of school
And he's a underdog
Wanna learn more and more
Cuz his mama taught him good
He's about to change the face
Of yo ghetto neighborhood
Walking to school today
Saw a brother on the streets
Seem like errthang was cool
Cept the brother's packing heat
Oop oop
Then everything changed
Cuz he saw his own wings
And his mother was sad
They will last
Time will past
