[Chorus:]
Humdi Lila Allah Jehova
Yahweh Dios Ma'ad Jah
Rastafara fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop

It's bigger than religion
hip-hop
it's bigger than my niggas
hip-hop
it's bigger than the government 
humdi luli lali lulo
This one fa' Dilla, hip-hop
humdi luli la, humdi luli la lilulo, humdi lulila humdi lulilaaa...

[V1]
we ain't dead said the children don't believe it
We just made ourselves invisible
underwater, stove-top, blue flame scientist come out with your scales up
get baptized in the ocean of the hungry
Humdi luli lalilulo, Humdi lulilalilu
My niggas turn in to gods, 
walls come tumblin...aaahhh

[Chorus]
Humdi lila Allah jehova
yahweh dios ma had ja
Rastafara fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop

It's bigger than religion
hip-hop
it's bigger than my niggas
hip-hop
it's bigger than the government 
humdi luli lali lulo
This one is the healer, hip-hop

humdi luli la, humdi lulilalilulo, humdi lulila, humdi lulilaaaa

[V2]
Told you we aint dead yet
we been livin' through your internet
you don't have to believe everything you think
we've been programmed wake up, we miss you.
they call you indigo, we call you Africa.
go get baptized in the ocean of the people
Humdi luli lalulilo
say reboot, refresh, restart.
fresh page, new day, o.g.'s, new key...

humdi lulila, humdi lulila lilulo, humdi luli la, humdilulila
