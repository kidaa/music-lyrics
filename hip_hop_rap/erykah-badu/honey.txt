So tell me Slim what you wanna do
When you know I'm in love wit you
Everytime that I turn around
Look for you but you cant be found
Fly free baby fine wit me
I'm in love wit a bumble bee
Ooh Slim, boy you killing me
But you soo sweet ta me
Oww

[HOOK]
Honey you so sweet
Sugar got a long way to catch you
You so sweet
All I gotta do is add a lil lemmon
You my favorite drank
Ya make me thank
Oww
Honey you so sweet

So tell me Slim, what its gonna be
It dont be like this usually
When it come to that ,"what it do.."
I dont fall for that "woop-tee-woo" bull
Ooh boy can you tell me please

Wanna know if ya feelin' me
Ooh Slim boy ya killin' me,
But you soo sweet ta me

You really turn me on
You got that honey
Stop acting funny
You really turn me on

So tell me Slim, what you tryin to do
Im trynna get me an interview
Look for you all over town
But you gave me the run around
Fly free baby fine wit me
I need to know if you're feelin' me
Can you stick your pinky finger in my tea
Cause you soo sweet ta me
Oww!
