A feeling I've been holding back so long 
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out 
On your loving

All night long, I waited for your love to come 
To the roof, to show you the groove 
It's you that I love, I love 
And for this loving, I'll be waiting 
For your love, anticipating 
Hurry I said, cause I can't wait to get it on

You've got me, shook up, shook down, shook out 
On your lovin' 
And boy, there is just no way, I'll ever, get over you 

All night long, I waited for your love to come 
To the roof, to show you the groove 
It's you that I love, I love 
Up on this rooftop, I'll be waiting 
For your love, anticipating 
Hurry up I said, 'cause I can't wait to get it on

All night long 
Climb up on the rooftop, don't stop 
My love's waiting when you reach the top 

Jamaica funk, that's what it is 
Let it get into you 
Jamaica funk, that's what it is 
Coming from Jamaica

Let it get into you 
Cause I feel the funk, deep down in my soul 
Comin' from Jamaica
