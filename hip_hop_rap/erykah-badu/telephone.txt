Telephone...
It's ol' dirty
He wants to give you directions home
Said it wont be too long
The day is gone..
It's 3:30..
To hungry for sum love, love
Last forever

Just fly away to heaven brother
Make a place for me brother
Fly away to heaven brother
Save a place for me brother
Fly away to heaven brother
Put in a word for me...
Telephone
Hmmmmmm

Telephone,
Its so dirty..
He wants to give you directions home
Said it wont be too long
Said it wont be too long

Telephone...
It's too early
We want to hear a long song..
Transition with a real slow fade

Just fly away to heaven brother
Make a place for me brother
Fly away to heaven brother
Save a place for me brother
Fly away to heaven brother
Put in a word for me...
Telephone
Oh

Transition time to go away
Time to go away
Slow fade...
Slow, slow fade oh

Just fly away to heaven brother
Make a place for me brother
Fly away to heaven brother
Save a place for me brother
Fly away to heaven brother
Put in a word for me..
Fly away to heaven brother

Gather on the hill
Two hearts up in the sky
Celebrate your life
Oh, say I love you

Gather on the hill
Two hearts up in the sky
Celebrate your life
Oh, say I love you

Gather on the hill
Two hearts up in the sky
Celebrate your life
Oh, say I love you
