You can see straight through me
Never thought you'd do me
The way you do
How can anyone be so cruel
When you know I love you, yes I do
Misunderstood
Turned your back on me and left me lonely
I wish I could
Open up my heart so you can know me

How can we make love when you don't love me
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love
No no 
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no

You have me calling out your name
What is this strange thing inside me
How can anyone be such a fool
When you know you love me, yes you do, yes you do
When I first met you
I could hardly see
But now I'm blind, for real
I wish you knew how to rescue me

From this misery

How can we make love when you don't love me
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love
No no 
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no

How can we make love when you don't love me
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love
No no 
You don't show no love 
You don't show no love
You don't show no love
No no

You make me feel like we can make love
But I know too much, much too much
You make me feel like we can make love
But I know too much, much too much
You make me feel like we can make love
But I know too much, much too much
Baby you
