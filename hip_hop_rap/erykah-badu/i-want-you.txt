[Chorus]
Love is on the way 
All I got to say 
Is it wont let go
We can pray to early May
Fast for 30 days
Still It wont let go
Got a good book and got all in it
Tried a little yoga for a minute
But it wont let go oooh
Tried to turn the sauna up hotter
Drank a whole jar of holy water
But it wont let go

And your words got a way
So what we gonna do

So what we gonna do
I know you really want this
So what we gonna do

So what we gonna do
I feel your love
