1 -     If you were worried 'bout where 
I been or who I saw or 
What club I went to with my homies 
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me 

If you were worried 'bout where

Somebody told me that this planet was small 
We used to live in the same building on the same floor 
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour 
And peep this Ethiopian Queen from Philly 
Taking classes abroad 
She studying film in photo flash focus record 
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score 
She said she love my show in Paris at Elyse Montmartre 
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart 
We knew from the start that things fall apart 
Intense and shatter, she like, that shit don't matter 
When I get home, get at her, pull out her phone 
Whatever, let's lay, let's get together 
Shit, you think that not? 
Think that dog went home and forgot? 

Time passed, now we back in Philly, she up in my spot 
Telling me the things I'm telling her is makin' her hot 
Started building with her constantly 'round the clock 
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me... 

Repeat 1

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight 
And sometimes I got to be out at the height of the night 
And that's when she flip and get on some... 

[Erykah]
Another loney night? 
Seems like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic 
I know you gotta get that paper daddy, keep that shit tight 
But yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me? 
While politickin' with my sister from New York City 
She said she know this ball player, and he think I'm pretty 
Psych, I'm playin' fool, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin' fool 
And when cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin', fool 
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl 
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills 
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme 
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind 

[Roots]
Yeah, so what you sayin' is I can trust you 

[Erykah]
Is you crazy?  You my king, for real 

[Both]
But sometimes, relationships get ill 

[Erykah]
No doubt 

Repeat 1 

[Roots]
That snake could be that chick or that rat 
Could be that cool cat that's whisperin' 
She's trying to play you for the fool, black 
If something's on your chest then let it be known 
See I'm not your "every-five-minutes" all on the phone 
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact 
That people bite back, fracture what's in tact 
And they'll forever be 
I ain't on some "Oh, I'm a celebrity" 
I deal wit the real, so if it's artificial, let it be 
I seen people caught in love like whirlwinds 
Listening to they squalls and listenin' to they girlfriends 
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends 
Lies come in, that's where the drama begins 
And she like... yo
