Everything around you see
The Ankhs, the wraps, the plus degrees
And yes even the mysteries
Its all me
Sometimes it hard to move you see
When you growing publicy
But if I have to chose between
I chose me

Had 2 babies different dudes
And for them both my luv was true
This is my last interview, oooh
Hey there's me, ooh
This year I turned 36
Damn it seems it came so quick
My ass and legs have gotten thick yea
Its all me
I use to pray to God above
But now Im filled with so much luv
But even if the world cant see
Its still me
Will I escape this vanity?
Or will I keep on smoking trees?
But I'll just let it go and be, be, be Me

Ah, leave it alone babe
Well well well
Ah oh, leave it alone babe
Just being me
Ah, leave it alone babe
Well well well
Ah oh, leave it alone babe
Just being me

Sometimes I dont know what to say
So many leaders to obey
But I was born on saviors day, yes
So I chose me
And in the world of greed and hate
They may try to erase my face
But millions spring up in my place
Ooh, believe in me
As sure is all and all is one
We all should grow before its done
So I salute you Farrakan, yes
Cuz you are me
Before I end this crazy dream
Before I take one for the team
Yo ass done matched the gasoline, yes
That's Collene
