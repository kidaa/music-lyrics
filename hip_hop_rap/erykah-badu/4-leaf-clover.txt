Buzilla baby

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way

Here I am, on a cloud
If you want me take the chance try love out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting cupid's arrow you just might try
So don't miss baby, take your time
You only got one chance, yes

[1] - Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Catch a four leaf clover
Love my getcha over
Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way

Like the way I am free
Going places, being things I wanna be
Settle down, is oh so hard
But I will pray you that one chance
So pick the one right one
And don't miss it, take your time
You only got one chance, do wee ooh wee ooh

[Repeat 1]

Free as a bird, yeah, yeah
To catch me is to catch a leprechaun
Hold on to your rabbit's foot
I just might be yours forever

[Repeat 1]

Catch a four leaf clover
Catch a four leaf clover
Catch a four leaf clover
Love might getcha over
Catch a four leaf clover
Catch a four leaf clover
Try and love might come your way
Maybe we'll get over
