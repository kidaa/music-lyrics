My eyes are green
Cos I eat a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
[x3]
I don't care, I swear
I'm too through with you, I am
You don't mean nothing to me
So go ahead and be with your friend
My eyes are green
Cos I eat a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
[x3]
I'm insecure
But I can't help it
My mind says move on
My heart lacks behind
But I don't love you any more
I'm so insecure
Never knew that love did this
Ooh, ooh
I can't remember the last time I felt this way
About somebody
You've done something to my mind
And I can't control it
But I don't love you any more
Yes I do, I do
Loving you is wrong baby
Ooh, ooh
La-di-da
Dum-dee-da-da
Dum-didi-da-da-da
Dum-didi-da-dum-di
I'm so confused
You tried to trick me yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh
Never knew that love could hurt like this
Never thought I would but I got dissed
Makes me feel so sad and hurt inside
Feel embarrased so I want to hide
Silly me I thought your love was true
Change my name to Silly E. Badu
Before I heal, it's gonna be a while
I know it's gonna be a while, chil'
[ad-libs]
I hope it's not too late
Too late, too late, too late
Feeling insecure
Your love has got me sore
I don't want no more
Oh, oh
It's too late, oh, oh ooh, ooh
I'm sorry I love you
At first when you was cool
You told me you loved me too, ooh
And then you lost your love [x3]
You wanted me to go away
But I can't go
See I can't leave, it's too late
I can't leave, it's too late [x3]
Just make love to me
Just one more time and then you'll see
I can't believe I made a desperate plea
Believe me yeah, yeah, no, oh
You see I can't leave, it's too late
I can't leave, it's too late
Don't you know, I can't leave, it's too late
Can't go no where, no
It's too late [x4]
Yeah
Come on babe
Don't you want be strong with me
You told me we could have a family
Want to run to me when you're down and low
But times get tough and there you go
Out the door, you wanna run again
Open your arms and you'll come back in
Wanna run cos you say you're afraid, afraid
Never knew what a friendship
Never knew how to really love
You can't be what I need you to
And I don't know what is up with you
I know our love will never be the same
But I can't stand the growing pains
