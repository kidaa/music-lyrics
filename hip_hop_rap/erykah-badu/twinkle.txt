They don't know their language
They don't know their God
They take what their given
Even whan it feels Odd
They say their grandfathers and grandmothers work hard for nothing
And we still in this ghetto
So they end up in prisons
They end up in blood

They keep us uneducated,
Sick and depressed
they end up in blood
Doctor I'm addicted now
I'm under arrest
they end up in blood
We makin' mo' money than a muthaf**ka
they end up in blood
With no choices there's no hope for us
they end up in blood

Started with a rhyme from old ancent times
Decedents of warlocks,
Witches with ill glitches
Children of the matrix be hittin' them car switches
Seen some Virgin Virgos hanging out with Venus Bitches

Cause
They don't know their language
They don't know their God
They take what their given
Even whan it feels Odd
They say their grandfathers and grandmothers work hard for nothing
And we still in this ghetto
So they end up in prisons
They end up in blood
They keep us uneducated,
Sick and depressed
they end up in blood
Doctor I'm addicted now I'm under arrest
they end up in blood
We makin' mo' money than a muthaf**ka
they end up in blood
With no choices there's no hope for us
they end up in blood
