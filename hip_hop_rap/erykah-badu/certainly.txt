who gave u permission to rearrange me
certainly not me
who told you that it was alright to love me
certainly not me

I was not looking for no love affair
and now you wanna fix me
I was not looking for no love affair
and now you want to mold me
Was not looking for no love affair
now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
and now you wanna control me
hold me

You're really trying to get creative with me love
and that's alright, but
you tried to get a little tricky turned my back
and then you slipped me a mickey.

The world is mine 
When I wake up
I don't need nobody telling me the time

Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
