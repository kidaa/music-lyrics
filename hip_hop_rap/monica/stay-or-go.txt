This is so annoying 
As I grow up and I know that you won't 
I don't understand whats so hard 
You either wanna be with me or you don't 

One day you love me 
Next day you wanna leave 
You're so up and down 
Well I'm about good and tired of this 
Too fly for you to not know what you want 

So let me know 
Whatcha gonna do 
Stay or go 
Cause I'm not waiting 
Boy yes or no 
I'm about to decide for you 
Stay or go 
Stay or go 
Stay or go 

Tried to give you real love 
That's when you up and run away 
But when I act like I'm done with you 
So done, So done, So done 
That's when you decide you wanna stay 
I don't got time to waste like this 
Too fly to put up with this day to day 

So let me know 
Whatcha gonna do 
Stay or go 
Cause I'm not waiting 
Boy yes or no 
I'm about to decide for you 
Stay or go 
Stay or go 
So let me know 
Whatcha gonna do 
I gotta know, know 
Cause I'm not waiting 
Not anymore 
About to decide for you 
Stay or go 
I gotta know 

La la la la la la 
Let me know 
Whatcha gonna do 
Stay or go 
Cause I'm not waiting 
Yes or no 
I'm about to decide for you 
Stay or go 
Stay or go 
Stay or go
