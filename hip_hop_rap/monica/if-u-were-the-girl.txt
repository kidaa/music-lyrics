[Jermaine:]
Let's kick a little something out there for all them cars that be bumpin. uh uh uh MO wassup

[chorus:] if you were the girl would you stay trippin' if you were the girl would you deal
with all stress, heartache, lonely nights while you are out late is it fair. if you were the
girl would you be a rider if you were the girl could you still try to work it out talk it out
while i'm stayin out trying to play around

[verse 1:] would you deal with me come home every night when i want to and when you ask where
ive been i just give you the same excuse, knowing that i was up in the club with my girls
like i aint got a curfew smelling like liquor and i'm shy cuz you're still sittin up now
could you deal with that if you were the girl

[Chorus]

[Verse2:] would you start an argument or just let it all ride and get some sleep tonight and
then bring it up soon as you open your eyes, cuz its been on your mind but i can do a whole
story on why i was late hopin you believe me and just don't make  you up and wanna leave me
but can you take all this and still and still love me

[chorus]
