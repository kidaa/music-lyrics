They say when you find the one there'll be no second guessing 
You'd feel it deep in your heart you'll know that it was destined 
The feelin inside will let you know 
Something that you cant deny just let it grow 
They say its better to love than never love at all 
To appreciate all the good sometimes you gotta fall 
But I was foolish 
I shouldn't let you go 
But now I miss you 
I gotta let you know 

I need you back back in my life 
I need your kiss kiss in my life 
And its been so long since you been gone 
Baby wont you come back home 
You only get one one one one love love 
One in a lifetime 
You only get one one one one love love 
One in a lifetime 
And I cant believe that I almost missed the signs 
Right in front of my eyes 
And now I know the love is real its hard to say why 
One one love 
One in a lifetime 
And that one is you 

They say that pleasure comes with pain 
And im so used to being whole its hard to be half again 
And you gotta feel the same way 
My tears are steady falling like a pouring rain 
Tell me will the forecast change one 

If you love somebody gotta let em know 
Tomorrow's never promised you gotta let it show 
If you love somebody you gotta let em know 
Tomorrow's never promised you gotta let it show 

I need you back back in my life 
I need your kiss kiss in my life 
And its been so long since you been gone 
Baby wont you come back home 
You only get one one one one love love 
One in a lifetime 
You only get one one one one love love 
One in a lifetime 
And I cant believe that I almost missed the signs 
Right in front of my eyes 
And now I know the love is real its hard to say why 
One one love 
One in a lifetime 
And that one is you that one 
And that one is you that one 
And that one is you that one 
And that one is you that one 
Is you 

I will climb the highest mountain 
Swim the deepest oceans for you you you cause you are the one 
I will walk across the desert just to get that message to you you you cause you are the one 
There aint a thing in this world that I wouldn't do 
Right hand to the man 
Boy I'm tellin the truth 
So all my ladies if you feel me 
Then put your hands up for that one 
For that one 

You only get one one one one love love 
One in a lifetime 
You only get one one one one love love 
One in a lifetime 
And I cant believe that I almost missed the signs 
Right in front of my eyes 
And now I know the love is real its hard to say why 
One one love 
One in a lifetime
