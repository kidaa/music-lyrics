Its just one of dem days 
When I want to be all alone 
Its just one of dem days 
When I gotta be all alone 

Verse 1: 
I wanna take some time out 
To think things through 
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong 
But I'm so in love with you 
So understand that I'm only in love 
You're the only one I need 
So have no thought that I want to leave 
And baby trust me please 

Chorus: 
Don't take it personal 
Take the bitter with the sweet 
Easy come, easy go 
Don't take it personal 
Take the bitter with the sweet 
Cause good things come to an end 
Don't take it personal 
Baby, baby, baby, baby 
Don't take it personal 

Verse 2: 
I sit and think about everything we do 
And I find myself in misery and that ain't cool 
Hey now I really wanna be with you the whole way through 
But the way you make me feel inside gets me confused 
As I swing back mood to mood 
Its not because of you 
I never want you to be insecure 
So understand that I'm only in love 
You're the only one I need 
I'll be there for you when you need me boy 
So baby don't you leave 

Chorus 

Don't take it personal, yeah 
Don't take it personal 

Don't take it personal 
Take the bitter with the sweet 
Easy come, easy go 
Don't take it personal 
Take the bitter with the sweet 
Cause good things come to an end 

repeat til end
