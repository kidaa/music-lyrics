When I hear the children of today
They're questioning me the way
The way that they should live
I often wonder
Wonder what to do
To help them make it through
And the world's going straight

Open my heart to see
That is time with me
Searchin' for the answers to these problems
I'm always facing things that are tryin' me
Testing all the things that I believe

Sometimes I feel so down
And no one here's around
But you, you never left me lonely
And now I see what a true friend means
And I trust that you would always be here for me
Lord I give you all

Open my heart to see
That is time with me
Searchin' for the answers to these problems
I'm always facing things that are tryin' me
Testing all the things that I believe

Now I'm here before you
So tell me what to do
Guess I'll do open my heart
My heart to you
Here I am
Searching for all the answers to my problems
Lord I'm facing things
Can you help me
You're trying all that I need
The things I belive
Lord, no no no no
Here I am
Here I am
I'm searching for searching for it
Lord I need, need, need
That's tryin' me
Testing all the things that I believe
Here I am
Lagging all the understand single things I can't see
I am your child
Oooh oh oh
That're tryin' me
Can't you help me
I'm lagging understanding
I'm your child no matter what they say
I'm with you every day
Protect me every day
Protect me oh oh..
