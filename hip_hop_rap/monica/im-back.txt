It's been a while 
Since I saw you
And since you hurt me
And it's been a while
Since I saw started
Back doing my thing
And if you wanna know
Why I've been on the low
What you see was me
Getting to know me
And now it's time to see
That I

I've learnd some things 
And I've been some places
That I chose to go
And I saw some faces
But I know that's the way life is
And it's time to get back to this
Back to

*Back to what I love, giving up hugs
Taking time to say, "What's up?"
To my girls and to all my thugs
Back to selling out shows, doing videos
Letting all my people know
I'm back and I won't lose track*

I heard some things
Things that weren't true
Supposed to be about me
But I have a dream
And I won't let nobody stop me
I tell you know now
That I'm gonna stay around
And that they can do them
'Cause I'm a do me
And now it's time to see
That I

I've learnd some things 
And I've been some places
That I chose to go
And I saw some faces
But I know that's the way life is
And it's time to get back to this
Back to what I love

[Repeat *]

Ooh, it feels good to be back
And, ooh, how could people think that
That I, I wouldn't get my spot back
And for those who thought that just know
That I'm back to what I love

[Repeat * x2 with ad lib]
