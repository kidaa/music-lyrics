I've been talkin to some friends of mine about you boy
They say you're bout to have a child
When you goin' tell me bout it
This other chick your sleepin' with
Now you gotta deal with it
Hope you've found happiness
I've found myself in such a mess

With you
and I put way to much love 
Into you
Through the one day
we'll be true
and time after time
I stuck with you
but now I'm too through

Cause I've been the fool
Sittin' round too long 
I think its about time
That I ring da bell and carry on
I forgave you before
But its too far long
I think its bout time
That I ring da bell and move along

You said it was a mistake
On one night you saw her late
Must of been for pure affection
Boy you didn't have protection
You had to think of me
But you did never see
Yourself in this predicament
You never thought that it would catch up

With you
and I put way to much love 
Into you
Through the one day
we'll be true
and time after time
I stuck with you
but now I'm too through

Cause I've been the fool
Sittin' round too long 
I think its about time
That I ring da bell and carry on
I forgave you before
But its too far long
I think its bout time
That I ring da bell and move along

Cause I've been the fool
Sittin' round too long 
I think its about time
That I ring da bell and carry on
I forgave you before
But its too far long
I think its bout time
That I ring da bell and move along

How awful the way
You treated me
Gave you everything
So hurt to say
You didn't tell me
Can't wait to leave
