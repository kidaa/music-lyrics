How dare u go and make me choose
My hustling is what made you, you
You never had nothing until I paid the dues
My word is law I laid the rules
Why you trippin' on a brother about the things he do
Look, work can never matter how I got the loot
But you never hesitate cause you drive the coupe
I made you ball, ain't that the truth

I never asked for that much
You stay out late every night
Down at the gentlemen's club
Seems like you can't get it right
I knew when I saw the G's
You would be harder to please
You wanted more than enough
That when it got to be rough

First time I was down for you
I thought you really wanted to
But you don't know how much pain it took
To put that cash up for your goods
I See your suit behind the bar
You can't even drive the cars
Sometimes I don't know what to do
And am I worth it to you, baby

See I'm in the Accolate
Coming through ride alone with flakes
The street's my home, up in the zone
Searching a n*gga car tryin' to get my bone
Get my name, wear that thang
I don't know but I'm searching man
Lookin' for that sweet lick
No time for no cheap chick
I'm working

You must believe I gotta get you out of the streets
I disagree when you tell me that you do it for me
I still believe, I know your in a little too deep
But I gotta do what I gotta do to get yu back here with me, babe

I like the cash and all that
But I just can't watch my back
And if they catch me with you
Who knows what they wouldn't do
You've spent too long in this game
Now baby you gotta change
Before I lose you for life
I wanted to be your wife

First time I was down for you
I thought you really wanted to
But you don't know how much pain it took
To put that cash up for your goods
I See your suit behind the bar
You can't even drive the cars
Sometimes I don't know what to do
And am I worth it to you, baby

See baby girl I gotta hustle
See it's something of mine dat I must do
Everything that I do, I did for us two
Getting' mine on the grind is a must too
Plus you want all them finer things
I bought a car, clothes, a diamond ring
Everything's on paper, they keep me on the caper
If it ain't gonna bread then I'm gonna holla at you later, baby

You must believe I gotta get you out of the streets
I disagree when you tell me that you do it for me
I still believe, I know your in a little too deep
But I gotta do what I gotta do to get yu back here with me, babe

Outta the Streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
Outta the Streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
Outta the Streets, streets, streets, streets, streets
Outta the Streets, streets, streets, streets, streets

You must believe I gotta get you out of the streets
I disagree when you tell me that you do it for me
I still believe, I know your in a little too deep
