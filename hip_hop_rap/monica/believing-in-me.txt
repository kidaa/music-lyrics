I apologize for what I've done
I admit that I was ruling control didn't know that I was selling my soul to someone who didn't care at all couldn't see that you were bad for me gave so much that it was making me weak now I cant believe the way that it feels to finally be free

[Chorus:]
Ive moved on
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
And I'm glad that your gone
Cause your not what I need 
I'm believing in me
Ive moved on
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
Cause I'm right 
And your wrong
Cause your not what I need
This time I'm believing in me

The love I had for you was so deep I didn't notice there was something wrong with me when someone asked me was there anything I need I would cry and tell them pray for me but now I know exactly what it is so I'm changing up the way that I live I'm never letting go of my dreams and maybe you'll see

[Chorus:]
Ive moved on 
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
And I'm glad that your gone cause your not what I need 
I'm believing in me 
Ive moved on
And I'm strong
Going back to the place 
Where I know I belong 
Cause I'm right and your wrong
Your not what I need
I'm finally believing in me

So I hope you can forgive me I'm not gonna be the way I used to be starting over can be so scary but I'm gonna believe promise I'm not gonna let me down and my transformation starting right now but I'm really glad you stuck around cause you believed in me

So Ive moved on
And I'm strong 
I'm going back to the place 
Where I know I belong 
And I'm glad that your gone cause your not what I need
I'm believing in me
Ive moved on
And I'm strong
Going back to the place where I know I belong
Cause I'm right 
And your wrong
You were not what I need
I'm finally believing in me

Finally
Finally believing in me ... me
