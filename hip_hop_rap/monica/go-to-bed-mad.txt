[Chorus:]
I think your wrong 
You think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise
Before we go to bed tonight
Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise we may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

[Monica:]
Time is ticking
My eyes are getting heavy but I know we gotta squash this
Before it was popping
It's time for dropping
Copping attitudes right now
Nothings, nothing
Cause this ain't nothing
Don't you know that I love you
So start to stopping
Think about it
You'll see it's stupid

[Bridge:]
Agrue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing
And just hang up the phone
I want
I wanna talk in the mood
See we need a resoltuion 
Like that Aaliyah song

[Chorus:]

[Tyrese:]
What time is it
I'm not on a mission
To stay up with you all night
It makes me so sick
To my stomach 
Everytime we argue and fight
I mean it girl my head gets lite
It just ain't right
I'm feed right up please
It's 2:15 in the morning
There is no need

[Chorus:]

[TyreseMonica:]
Am not trying to be mad at you
Why you make me wanna not fool with you
Can't you see I'm tired girl
Besides the fact it's a quarter past 2
A girl like me got things to do
So let's see each others point of view

[Chorus:]

[Repeat]

I just wanna love you baby
I place no one above you baby
You're the only one for me
Let's not argue my baby
Everything you want and need
And my baby come and take my hand
I got you baby
Let me be the man you want in your life baby
