La, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 

So let them say its wrong 
For me to love you 
They could never feel 
The way that I do when we kiss 
When we're close like this 

They can't see inside my soul 
They can't know the love we know 
All they do is waste their time 
They can never change my mind 

1 - It's what my heart says 
    That is what I listen to 
    It's what my heart feels 
    That tells me, tells me what to do 
    It's what my heart knows 
    That's the only, the only truth I know is real 
    All I hear is what my heart says to me 

La, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la 
What my heart says 

Let them say that I'm a fool 
To fall so deeply 
Cause they will never ever be 
Loved so completely 
How can they even talk that way? 

They can't see it through my eyes 
They can't feel this love inside 
All their words don't mean a thing 
They can't change the way I feel, no, no 

Repeat 1 

And I have never felt so sure about anything 
See you are the one, the one that I need 
It doesn't matter what they think 
Or what they say 
I'm loving you anyway, oh 
All I know is what I hear 

Repeat 1 

La, la, la, la, la 
What my heart says 
Oh, what my heart says
