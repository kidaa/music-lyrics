HERE'S NO REASON TO GO ON

SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE HAS GONE

AND HAS CHANGED OUR DEEP EMOTIONS

WE HAD FEELINGS YOU AND ME

BUT OUR LOVE'S NOT MEANT TO BE

AND THE MAGIC RING HAS BROKEN

HEAR THE SOUND OF YOUR GUITAR

NOTES ARE COMING FROM AFAR

PLAYING SOFTLY TO YOUR LOVE TALK

I'VE BEEN UP BY ALL THIS GAME

AND ITS SUCH A CRYING SHAME

BUT THE MUSIC NOW IS OVER

SO MANY NIGHTS WE SAT TOGETHER

BUT WE'RE TOTAL STRANGERS NOW

WE TRY TO SPEAK

THE WORDS UNSPOKEN

AND NOW I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE.

I DON'T WANNA TAKE THIS FAKIN'

Can't go breaking my heart like you want

I DON'T WANNA TAKE IT, MAKE IT

YOU CAN'T SPIN ME AROUND, ROUND YOUR SOUL

IS THAT PITY IN YOUR EYES

YOU LOOK SAD TO ME TONIGHT

WHERE'S THE FEEL OF SWEET VIBRATIONS

I AM CLOSING DOWN ON YOU

BABY WHAT I WOULDN'T DO

NOT TO LOSE IMAGINATION

SO MANY NIGHTS WE SAT TOGETHER

BUT WE'RE TOTAL STRANGERS NOW

WE TRY TO SPEAK

THE WORDS UNSPOKEN

AND NOW I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE

I DON'T WANNA TAKE THIS FAKIN'

Can't go breaking my heart like you want

I DON'T WANNA TAKE IT, MAKE IT

YOU CAN'T SPIN ME AROUND, ROUND YOUR SOUL

EVEN IF YOU KEEP ON SAYING "DON'T LET GO,

LEAVE DECISIONS TILL TOMORROW"

MY HEART SAYS I HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR HEART

BUT I DON' T WANT NO MORE,

NO I DON'T WANT, NO I DON'T WANT, 'CAUSE

I DON'T WANNA TAKE THIS

SPIN ME AROUND, ROUND YOUR SOUL

I DON'T WANNA TAKE IT, MAKE IT

YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH MY HEART AND MY SOUL
