From Soul Food Soundtrack 

Verse 1: 
I was all alone, I was feeling rather low 
I needed someone to lift my spirits up, so I drooped in on a dance 
Just to take a glance and there this lovely thing was 
She was more than enough, I asked her for her hand 
Said would you like to dance, so pleased that I had asked 
She quickly took my hand, and we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam 
Ohhh 

Chorus 
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet On a slow jam 
For my baby and for me 
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet On a slow jam 
For my baby and for me 

Verse 2: 

Seems what you say is true, I feel the same way too 
You see I waited all night long just to dance with you 
And when you touched my hand, I knew you were the man 
To turn my world around, and make my dreams come true 
The magic in your eyes made me realize that everything I feel has got to 
be real 
And we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam 

Repeat Chorus 

Usher: 
I've been trying to find someone who I can give my good lovin to 
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone 
Monica: 
Now I've been tryin to find someone too 
I prayed to heaven and then I found you 
I swear I fell in love the night you danced into my heart 

Repeat Chorus
