Hey, yeah...
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
Oh...oh...oh...oh...
Oh, yeah
Oh...oh...

When I think of what I've done all the pain that I've brought
Baby, you should have walked out on me
And when I've turned away from you whenever there were
hard times
How could you still be with me

And if it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should have been mad at you

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

Never gave you my heart 'cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt when deep inside I knew
that
You're really what I need

And I always gave you up whenever I saw
Something better come along
And right when I come back you're waitin' for me
And you welcome me home

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

And if it takes my whole life I'll make it up to you
'Cause I've been so cruel
And you've given your love to me in spite of
everything
I-I don't deserve you

From this day forward I'm truly yours
But it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for loving me

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl
