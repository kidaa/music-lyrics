Mirror, mirror
Oh, oh ooh yeah, yeah

The very second I laid eyes on you
In the mirror in that dressing room
Seeing you with me I finally knew the picture was complete
I used to have my share of lonely days
Beneath the make up and the darkest shades
But ever since you came I know the meaning of true love again

It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul
I'm so exposed

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize
The girl all about the glitter
Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror

No, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Forget the fortune, you can keep the fame
Maybe if I had to choose, you know I'd trade it every time for you
Cause this reflection that I'm staring at
Is so amazing I can't turn my back
And every time I look at you and me together, boy, I know the truth, oh

It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul
I'm so exposed

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize
The girl all about the glitter
Cause now I see you by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror
I can't help it

Now she's running from love
That's all I'm guilty of
And I don't have to search no more
Found what I'm looking for
In the mirror
In the mirror

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize
The girl all about the glitter
Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror

Baby I see you
Baby I see me
Hope that we could be, forever
In the mirror
In the mirror

Baby I see you
Baby I see me
Hope that we could be, forever
In the mirror
