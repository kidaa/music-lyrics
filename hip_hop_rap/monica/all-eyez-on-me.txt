[Rodney Jerkins:]
I see you girl. Darkchild. 
I got my eyez on you. 
Let me see what you workin' with. 
Let's dance yeah come on, come on. 

[Monica:]
[Verse 1:]
When I step in the club
There's so much Love
All Eyez on Me
All the girls and thugs
Glasses go up
It's that time baby
If you're looking right
And your game is tight
Come chill with me
Get up on the floor
And dance some more
The night's just beginning 

[Chorus:]
I can feel your eyez on me
You're watchin'
And off up in the club
Tonight it's poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it, too
Know u do [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Now when I'm doin' my thang
You checkin' for me
Just step my way
Don't you be
Too shy or be ashamed
You get love from me
So when we movin' close
We're toe to toe
Just dance with me
And when we've come to an end
Me and my friends
We'll do it again 

[Chorus x2]

[Breakdown:]
Come on let me see you work it out
I'm a pretty young thang
Imma turn it out
Party all night
Workin' it out
Till the lights out
Till the early morn [x2]

[Bridge:]
Don't you know now is the perfect time
I can make it right
Makin' you all mine
Baby tonight if you hold it down
I can give you all that I got 

[Chorus x4]

[Ending:]
I see you ah baby!
You watchin' me ah baby!
I see you ah baby!
All Eyez On Me ah darling! [x2]
