I can't believe you're gone
Why'd you leave
Sometimes they hurt so bad

Verse 1:
He's the kind of guy
that runs the streets
But he treats me good
and he makes his dough illegally
That's how he's taking care of me
and I respect the fact that
He's chosen that life
but it keeps me up late at night
And I just can't spend my time
wondering where he's at, is he okay?
I wanna be by his side
but I commit a crime
I need to exclaim
 I don't wanna live that way

Chorus:
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more
Often need to understand
So I wrote him this song
Could not get him ???
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm singing sweet goodbye

Verse 2:
Though he promised that he would never put me in harm's way
That's something that he can't control
Cause the game remains the same
Now he says he wants out of here
But he's in too deep
And the only way that he will go is killing him or leaving me
So this is where I'm at and it hurts so bad
That I had to choose if I wanna live, or die with you

Chorus:
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more
Often need to understand
So I wrote him this song
Could not get him ???
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm singing sweet goodbye

Bridge:
I tried to give him hope
And promised him my life
But I don't know what made him want to leave this life
And as he went away
The tears fell from my eyes
And there's no turning back
There's only goodbye

Chorus:
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more
Often need to understand
So I wrote him this song
Could not get him ???
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm singing sweet goodbye

I love my baby so
But he's not here no more
Often need to understand
So I wrote him this song
Could not get him ???
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm singing sweet goodbye

I love you so
I need you so
It's hard to imagine
My life here without you
I love you so
I need you so
It's hard to imagine
My life here without you
Without you
Without you
