[Missy:]
Holla, new monica shit. yes. oh baby. yep

I been feeling something
U been treating me cold
U no longer want to touch me
The love has turned cold
And i don't feel special
The feeling i need to feel
In my gut i'm feeling something...
Another woman, keep it real

[CHORUS]
I, i had to go move on had to go move on
Cause you're not worthy of my love and all we did was fight and fuss fight and fuss
And she would, she would call your phone
And you would act like i was wrong for cursing you all night long

Now to you if zip means nada
So don't call don't page don't follow
And you can see me in the club, don't holla
And if you see me looking good don't bother
I know you hate to see me with my baby father
On the level as me, dun dada
Your loss, but you gon have to swallow
I do bad by myself
Stop proper..stop proper

Now the last few months been different
Cause you don't seem bad with time
U say you wanna stay with me
Did u go and change your mind
U getting phone calls after midnight
It's not exceptable
It don't take a scientist for me to know
Another chick is on the low

[CHORUS]
I, i, i i had to go move on gotta move on
Cause you're not worthy not worthy, not worthy of my love and all we did was fight and fuss
And she would, she would she would call your phone

And you would act like i was wrong for cursing you all night long

If you cared if you cared
You wouldn't play games like this
