Yeah...yeah
Oh...oh...
Oh...
Listen

Boy, it's been a long time
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothin' changed
Since we've been together
I must admit that I go crazy for you

And I can see it in your eyes
That there's somethin' you want to say to me
'Cause usually right now
You'll be holdin' on to me
But instead you tell me

Things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had is 'bout to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
I know things are different now, you've gone and
settled down
And I thought for sure you'd always wait me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have
took the chance
Boy, when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I'll always have your heart
I had the chance to have all the love oh, how I'm missing now

I hate that there is someone new
Comin' in and takin' my place
Doin' the things that we used to do
And makin' love to you

And oh, what am I supposed to do
It's killin' me 'cause I want you
And you should have known my love was true
And there's no one else in this world for me but you

But things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had is 'bout to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
You know things are different now, you're gonna settle
down
And I thought for sure you'd always wait for me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have
took a chance
Boy, when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I'll always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love oh, how I'm missing now

I know that I'm the one to blame for losing you, oh,
yeah
I really, really wish that I could be happy for you
There's just one thing I need you to do
Don't you touch her like you used to touch me
Don't you love her like you really need me
Don't you love her like you used to love me

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
But things are different now, you're gonna settle
down
And I thought for sure you'd always wait me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have
took a chance
Boy, when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I'll always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love oh, how I'm missing now

What hurts the most is letting go
Just to let you know I love you so
What hurts the most is letting go
Just to let you know I love you so

What hurts the most
