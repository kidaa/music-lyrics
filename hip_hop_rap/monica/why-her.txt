[Monica: ab-libbing]

[Verse 1:]
My last tear just fell from my eyes
Told myself that I wasn't going to cry no more
you did what you did, it is what it is and that's why I walked out the door.
Moved on with my life, but not really
Spent too much time wondering how could you
you do this to us while we we're in love I guess I was thinking too much

[Bridge:]
I was thinking that the sex had your love
You never could get enought cause I kept it hot
I listen to you tell me your dreams
And your fears
I wiped your tears
I was there and this is why this is hurting me

[Chorus:]
Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth it, to make you put her first and deceive me.
You wanna come back but I gotta know why her?
I thought she was all that? Then why you at my door?
Now look at you, look at us, what's all this for?
Hope you got the answers to my questions
Why her?

[Verse 2:]
This going to be the last time we say goodbye
Aint going to be no reruns of this episode
you did what you did, it is what it is Maybe if you would of told me
You weren't happy, you weren't satisfied
We could of worked it out
Maybe we could of tried
but you didn't say nothing All of alone fakin' it in front of me. Why?

[Bridge:]
I was thinking that the sex had your love
You never could care enough but you know I cant deny
I listen to you tell me your dreams
And your fears
I wiped your tears
I was there and it hurts me

[Chorus:]
Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth it, to make you put her first and deceive me.
You wanna come back but I gotta know why her?
I thought she was all that? Then why you at my door?
Now look at you, look at us, what's all this for?
Hope you got the answers to my questions
Why her?

[Monica: talking while ab-libbing in the background]

Now ladies, yall know I speak from experience right?
I used to look at him and wonder why.
Why her?
Yah know what I'm saying?
But ladies, I learn not to worry about them living a happily ever after
Because that shit just build on a lie
So it should of fall
That's why I stand tall baby, baby, baby
I just looked at him and said this is why you

[Chorus:]
Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth, to make you put her first and deceive me.
The grass looks greener on the other side
But I promise youll be back tonight
Now look at u, look at us, whats all thios for, hope u got the answer to my questions
Why her?
