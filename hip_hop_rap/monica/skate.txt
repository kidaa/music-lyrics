Chorus:
Everybody skate to the music, put your hands in the air 
Don't stop 'til it grooves ya, and you feel it everywhere 
Just skate to the music 'til you feel it going on 
Don't stop 'til ya lose it baby 
Everybody skate 
Verse 1: It's Sunday night, and we're about to have a ball 
The place is packed, been thinkin' bout it all day long 
People are jammin' and waiting for their favorite song 
With everyone in a world of their own 

Hook:
Can't wait to get up on the floor 
And bounce around to the sounds 
Don't just sit up on the wall 
Get down, baby get down 

Chorus

Verse 2: 
The beat is bumpin', the lights are movin' to the groove 
All in the light, we roll until the night is through 
Only a minute, before it puts you in the mood 
And from there, it's all up to you 

Hook: 
Can't wait to get up on the floor 
And bounce around to the sounds 
Don't just sit up on the wall 
Get down, baby get down
