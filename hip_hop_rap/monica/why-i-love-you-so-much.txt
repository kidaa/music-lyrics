Oooh baby 
You mean the world ooooh and everything that I want for 
Since I've been your girl 
Oh my whole life has been much better than ever before 
You got a tender sweet love, yes you do 
That weakens me and takes over me whenever we touch 

1 - Baby that's just why I love you so much 
Baby that's just why I can't get enough 
Baby that's just why I love you so much 
I love only you 

Now you say that your down 
Oh you said you won't play around 
No, no not with my heart 
And when your boys come around 
No your not disrespecting me 
And not trying to be Mr.-wanna-be-hard 
You let them know that I'm yours yes you do 
By holding me, and kissing me 
Let them know that for sure 

Repeat 1 

Yes, you don't ever say I'm too young thank you baby 
I've been around enough to know enough to know just what I want 
You don 't move too fast or make me rush 
No one day we're gonna talk about making love 
No doubt baby when the time is right 

Repeat 1 

Baby no one else 
Can do what you're doing to me 
You take me and you hold me 
You run me in your arms baby 
And I love you for that baby 
You don't run in front of your friends 
And you stand up and be a real man 
I love you I love you and I love you for that baby 

Repeat 1
