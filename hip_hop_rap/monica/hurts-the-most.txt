[Verse 1:]
Boy its been a long time,
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothings changed
Since weve been together
I must admit that Im still crazy bout you
And I can see it in your eyes
That theres something you wanna say to me
Cuzz usually right now youd be holding on to me
But instead youre telling me.

[Bridge:]
That things have changed
Theyre not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

[Chorus:]
And baby what hurts the most
Is letting go
I just want you to know
That I love you so
And though things are different now
Youve gone and settled down
I thought for sure youd always wait for me
Ill tell you what hurts the most
Is that I shouldve took the chance
Boy when you come to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought, Id always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love
And oh how Im missin you now

[Verse 2:]
I hate that theres someone new
Comin in and taking my place
Doin things that we used to do
And making love to you.no
What am I supposed to do
Its killing me cuzz I want you
And you shouldve know my love was true
And theres no one else in this world for me but you

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I know that Im the one to blame for losing you
Oh yeah
I really really wish that I could be happy for you
Theres just one thing I need you to do
Dont you touch her like you used to touch me
Dont you love her like you really needed me
Dont you love her like you used to love me

[Chorus]

What hurts the most
Is letting go
Just let you know
I love you so
