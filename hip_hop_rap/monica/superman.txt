[Verse 1]
You're my super hero ooh you rock my world 
If you show me how I can be your super girl 
Give you super super love Cause you're super super hot 
Give you more than a little bit Give you everything I've got 
Do you think of me Like I think of you 
Hoping that what I feel is what you're feeling too 
I want too go through a few ways to describe 
just what's in my heart 

There is no height that I won't climb 
There is no light that I won't shine 
There is no time that I won't find 
And I'm so glad I found the time tonight 

[Chorus]
There is no other place that I'd rather be 
There is no other face that I'd rather see 
The way that you do me is somethin like a movie 
Waking up to you is just like waking up to 
Superman 
It's a bird it's a plane it's 
Superman 
I can be your Lois Lane 
Superman 
There aint nothing you can't do 
I Just want to be with you 
And I hope you feel it too You're my 
Superman 

[Verse 2]
It's beating in my heart, It's the shaking in my soul 
Everytime I touch you baby I go 
It's the power of you're love, It's the passion in your kiss 
That I'm always lookin for 

There aint no sea that I won't swim 
There aint no void that I can't fill 
And There's no time that I won't find 
and I'm glad I found the time tonight 

[Chorus]
There is no other place that I'd rather be 
There is no other face that I'd rather see 
The way that you do me is somethin like a movie 
Waking up to you is just like waking up to 
Superman 
It's a bird it's a plane it's 
Superman 
I can be your Lois Lane 
Superman 
There aint nothing you can't do 
I Just want to be with you 
And I hope you feel it too You're my 
Superman 

[Bridge]
Let me touch the sky Please don't hit the breaks 
Fly me to the moon I want to see heavens gates 
I want to feel what it's like to be with superman 
I'll stay by your side an if you take my hand 
Then there's no dreams that we can't see 
And there's no thing that we can't be 
And there's no time that I won't find 
and I'm so glad that I found the time tonight 

[Chorus]
There is no other place that I'd rather be T 
here is no other face that I'd rather see 
The way that you do me is somethin like a movie 
Waking up to you is just like waking up to 
Superman 
It's a bird it's a plane it's 
Superman 
I can be your Lois Lane 
Superman 
There aint nothing you can't do 
I Just want to be with you 
And I hope you feel it too You're my 
Superman
