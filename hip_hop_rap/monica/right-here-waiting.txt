Oceans apart
Day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice
On the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
I see you next to never
How can we stay forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted
All the time
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter and I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh can you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we came so survive
This romance, but in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaance

[Instrumental Break]

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
I'll be, I'll be right right here, oh waiting on youuuuuuuuu 
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I'll be right here waiting for you
Oh, I love you
Oh whatever it takes
Whatever you do
Where ever you go

I'm never leavin' you I Will Be Waiting 
I'll be right here waiting, for youuuuu oh oh, youuu
