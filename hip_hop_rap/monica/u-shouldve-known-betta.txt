I didnt ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didnt need the shopping sprees
In L.A. or Melrose, boy if you didnt know it, well, now you know, 
I didnt need the furs or the jewelries 
Because material things they dont mean much to me 
And ever since you've been gone 
I have been holding us down on my own

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied 
So you can stop asking, asking me why
Why I never left you, and why I kept it real
And why im still with you 

You shouldve known better than to think I would leave 
You shouldve known better than to doubt me 
It dont matter if you are up 
matter if you are down
Either way im gonna be around 
You shouldve known that I would stay by your side 
You shouldve known your girl was gonna ride or die 
And it just dont matter if ya rich or poor 
Out or in doing 5 to10 
You shouldve known better

What makes you think that I would forget about you 
Think about  it who comes to see ya 
Every Saturday and Monday I was on that receiver
Its me your girl your life your world  
My family and friends they just dont understand 
They say I should leave you lone
But I say that they should just leave us lone 
Dont u get it 

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied 
So u can stop asking, asking me why
Why I never left you, and why I kept it real
And why im still with you 

You shouldve known better than to think I would leave 
You shouldve known better than to doubt me 
It dont matter if you are up 
matter if you are down
Either way im gonna be around 
You shouldve known that I would stay by your side 
You shouldve known your girl was gonna ride or die 
And it just dont matter if ya rich or poor 
Out or in doing 5 to 10 
You shouldve known better

You shouldve known better than to think I would leave 
You shouldve known better than to doubt me 
It dont matter if you are up 
Matter if you are down
Either way im gonna be around 
You shouldve known that I would stay by your side 
You shouldve known your girl was gonna ride or die 
And it just dont matter if ya rich or poor

You shouldve known better
