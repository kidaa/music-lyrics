[Verse 1:]
Started as a little girl
Singing so changed my world
Flipped my world upside down
I got lost and I couldn't be found
So much on my shoulders
So much on my mind
Since no one can help me
I think I just need some time

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Getaway from all the heartache and pain that life can bring
I really don't want to sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody needs some time
That they can getaway

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I wish I was invisible
'Cause then no one will know
Where I am to ask me for anything
'Cause I've given so much of me
When it's a time for me to receive
'Cause Monica has her needs
Who's going to look out for me?

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Getaway from all the heartache and pain that life can bring
I really don't want to sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody needs some time
That they can getaway

[Verse 3:]
You know I'm not superwoman
And I'm not made of steel
I try my best to handle
All I have to deal with
It's not as easy as it seems
And to think this was my dream
Now for everything I have I'm grateful
But sometimes I want to get away

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Getaway from all the heartache and pain that life can bring
I really don't want to sound
Like I can't hold my ground
But everybody needs some time
That they can getaway

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I wish I could hide away
Looking for a place to getaway
Getaway from all the heartache and pain that life can bring
I really don't want to sound
Like I can't stand my ground
But everybody needs some time
That they can getaway
