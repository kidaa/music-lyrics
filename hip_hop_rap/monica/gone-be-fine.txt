Can't believe you would leave me this way
Feeling kinda bad from the last things we said today 
Can't believe you would turn and walk away 
I'd know we would do this again and again 

You say you love me I'll come back with I hate you 
Only takes a day to 
Realize I'm in love with you 
You say you'll leave me 
I'll come back with just stay boy 
If you dont want my love 
Then I have no choice this time 

Tell me Baby what to do 
I ain't trippin' over you 
Any, Any other time 
Remember I'm gone be fine 
I, I remain the same 
I don't know what's up with you 
Any, Any other time 
Remember I'm gone be fine 

You said you didn't mean it that's fine 
You wanna take it back cause your havin a change of mind 
Sometimes saying sorry won't do 
Then somedays I can't do without you 

You say you love me I'll come back with I hate you 
Only takes a day to 
Realize I'm in love with you 
You say you're sober 
I'll come back with your stank boy 
If you dont want my love 
Then I have no choice this time 

Tell me Baby what to do 
I ain't trippin' over you 
Any, Any other time 
Remember I'm gone be fine 
I, I remain the same 
I don't know what's up with you 
Any, Any other time 
Remember I'm gone be fine 

Tell me Baby what to do 
I ain't trippin' over you 
Any, Any other time 
Remember I'm gone be fine 
I, I remain the same 
I don't know what's up with you 
Any, Any other time 
Remember I'm gone be fine
