Oh oh oh, oh yeah yes, oh oh oh, my, my 

Here we are face to face 
With the memories that can't be erased 
Although we need each other 
Things that changed, it's not the same 

Sometimes it makes me wonder 
Where would I be, if you hadn't discovered 
Which I did, inside of me 
I know there was something, that we could compare 

Oh, well, I, 

1-Never meant to cause you no pain 
I just wanna go back to being the same 
Well I, only wanna make things right 
Before you walk out of my life 

Remembering the good times 
From a portrait hung on high 
It's filled with so much color 
And the laughter we left behind 
I made the choice and you couldn't decide 
I made the choice, I was wrong you were right 
Deep down inside, I apologize 
rpt 1 

Though I made plans with you 
To always have time for you 
Before you walk out of my life 
I guess it's true, cannot live without you 
Don't ever go away, ooh oh yeah 
rpt 1, 1 

Before you walk out of my life
