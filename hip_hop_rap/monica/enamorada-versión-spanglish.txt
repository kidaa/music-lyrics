[You're in love]
Mmm...

Enamorada
Enamorada, eh
Enamorada
Enamorada, eh, eh

You're in love
It's obvious
Not with me 
And not with us
Looks like this time it's serious
If it's love
Go if you must

And I 
I just can't cry anymore
But I can't give you up

All I have is not enough, someone else has won your love
Mrate, ests enamorada enamorada
Part of me but only part knows you must obey your heart
You're in love, ests enamorada
Enamorada
Enamorada, eh
Enamorada
Enamorada, eh, eh

Some things you
Don't have to say
Somehow you
Communicate
It's a deep dark secret you've locked away
Can't escape
The hand of fate

And I 
I just can't wait any longer
Too much in love

All I have is not enough, someone else has won your love
Mrate, ests enamorada enamorada
Part of me but only part knows you must obey your heart
You're in love, ests enamorada

Enamorada, eh, eh

You're in love
It's obvious
Looks as though 
It's serious
Love can make you delirious
Doubt your faith
And lose your trust

You just don't care anymore
Too much in love, hey...
