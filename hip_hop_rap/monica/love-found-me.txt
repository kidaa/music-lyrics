I BUILT A WALL AROUND ME

WOULDN'T LET ANYONE INSIDE

LOVE WOULD JUST BRING MORE HEARTBREAK INTO THIS

HEART OF MINE

THOUGHT I WAS FINE ALONE

THEN YOU TOUCHED ME WITHOUT TOUCHING ME

HELD ME WITHOUT HOLDING ME

MOVED THIS HEART OF STONE

GAVE THIS HEART A HOME

THOUGHT THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY BUT ME

THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS BETTER WITHOUT LOVE

DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN LETTING SOMEBODY IN

WASN'T SAVING MY HEART FOR SOMEONE

DIDN'T THINK I COULD CHANGE

THEN YOU CHANGED EVERYTHING

JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I'D NEVER FIND LOVE

LOVE FOUND ME

YOU BROKE THROUGH ALL THE WALLS

YOU SAW SOMEONE NO-ONE COULD SEE

YOU SHINED THE LIGHT OF LOVE WHERE THE SHADOWS USED TO BE

THOUGHT I WAS FINE AND FREE

THEN YOU REACHED ME WHEN YOU REACHED FOR ME

TOUCHED SOMETHING SO DEEP IN ME

SHOWED MY HEART THE TRUTH

MY HEART BELONGS WITH YOU

THOUGHT THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY BUT ME

THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS BETTER WITHOUT LOVE

DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN LETTING SOMEBODY IN

WASN'T SAVING MY HEART FOR SOMEONE

DIDN'T THINK I COULD CHANGE

'TIL YOU CHANGED EVERYTHING

JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I'D NEVER FIND LOVE

LOVE FOUND ME

I KNOW I TOLD MYSELF

I'D NEVER GIVE MY HEART TO SOMEONE ELSE

BUT YOU CHASED OUT ALL THE DOUBT FROM MY MIND

I'VE WAITED FOR YOU FOR ALL MY LIFE

THOUGHT THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY BUT ME

THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS BETTER WITHOUT LOVE

DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN LETTING SOMEBODY IN

WASN'T SAVING MY HEART FOR SOMEONE

DIDN'T THINK I COULD CHANGE

THEN YOU CHANGED EVERYTHING

JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I'D NEVER FIND LOVE

LOVE FOUND ME

LOVE FOUND ME
