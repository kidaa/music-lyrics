[DirtBag]
Now listen baby im a dirt bag
I dont know the different faces, I cant take it 
But I got a jeep, so you lead and Ill follow 
Lunch up in a diner, if ya act right we dine in the Bahamas 
Now wow lil momma, im a gangsta 
Anywhere ya wanna go imma take ya
Oh my god you caught my eyes like from 20 yards 
You so damn fine 
Listen I dont eat peaches but the way you look to night 
I just might take a bite
Come closer, feel that 
Its a woman and a man and a latex
Out the shower, hotel flowers on the bed, 
Choice of wine white or red
What more can I say 
Monica, DirtBag, ATL MIA

[Monia]
You remember when I was just a young one 
And I was to afraid to quickly let you show me thangs
Not sure if I was ready for some good love, and im bout to set it off
Can you please be gental cuz I am the fragile kind 
And even tho im ready for the move of my time 
Now buckle up yo seat while I set it off

Baby let me set it off, do you mind it I get it off 
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call, if you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

I know your anxious but please lets make a compromise
Im so energized All in my neck my back my thighs 
Make sure the lock is safe before I set it off 

Baby let me set it off, do you mind it I get it off 
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call, if you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

Now imma get it , you can tell them Mo Said it 
And you betta not forget it, now dont sweat it 
And we can really go at it, if you let it lets protect it 
Now I bet it be good is you ready
But  the jump of heavy, my style varies
The club down I shut it, how I do it
I set it in me

Baby let me set it off, do you mind it I get it off 
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call, if you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off
