B] - Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute? 
[M] - Um hum sure. You look kind of familiar. 
[B] - Yeah you do too but umm I just wanted to know do you know somebody named 
you you know his name. 
[M] - Oh yeah definitely I know his name. 
[B] - I just wanted to let you know he's mine. 
[M] - Huh..no no he's mine. 

[Chorus] - You need to give it up 
Had about enough 
It's not hard to see 
The boy is mine 
I'm sorry that you 
Seem to be confused 
He belongs to me 
The boy is mine 

[B] - I think it's time we got this straight 
Let's sit and talk face to face 
There is no way you could mistake 
Him for your man - are you insane 

[M] - You see I know that you may be 
Just a bit jealous of me 
But you're blind if you can't see 
That his love is all in me 

[B] - You see I tried to hesitate 
I didn't wanna say what he told me 
He said without me he couldn't make 
It through the day ain't that a shame 

[M] - Maybe you misunderstood 
Cause I can't see how he could 
Wanna change something that's so good 
Because my love is all it took 

[Chorus]

[M] - Must you do the things you do 
Keep on acting like a fool 
You need to know it's me not you 
And if you didn't know it girl it's true 

[B] - I think that you should realize 
And try to understand why 
He is a part of my life 
I know it's killing you inside 

[M] - You can say what you wanna to say 
What we have you can't take 
From the truth you can't escape 
I can tell the real from the fake 

[B] - When will you get the picture 
You're the past, I'm the future 
Get away it's my time to shine 
And if you didn't know the boy is mine 

[Chorus]

[M] - You can't destroy this love I found 
You're silly games I won't allow 
The boy is mine without a doubt 
You might as well throw in the towel 

[B] - What makes you think that he wants you 
When I'm the one that brought him to 
This special place in my heart 
Cause he was my love right from from the start 

[Chorus]

[B] - The boy is mine 
[M] - Not yours 
[B] - But mine 
[M] - Not yours 
[B] - But mine 
[M] - Not yours 
[B] - But mine 

I'm sorry that you 
Seem to be confused 
He belongs to me 
The boy is mine
