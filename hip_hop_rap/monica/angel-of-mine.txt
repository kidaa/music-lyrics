Verse 1: 
When I first saw you I already knew 
There was something inside of you 
Something I thought that I would never find 
Angel of Mine 

I looked at you looking at me 
Now I know why they say the best things are free 
I'm gonna love you boy you are so fine 
Angel of mine 

How you changed my world you'll never know 
I'm different now you helped me grow 

Hook: 
You came into my life sent from above 
When I lost all hope you showed me love 
I'm checkin' for you boy your right on time 
Angel of Mine 

Verse 2: 
Nothing means more to me than what we shared 
No one in this whole world can ever compare 
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind 
Angel of Mine 

What you mean to me you'll never know 
Deep inside I need to show 

Repeat Hook 

I never knew I could feel each moment 
As if they were new 
Every breath that I take 
The love that we make 
I only share it with you 

Verse 1 only to first Angel of Mine 

Hook 

How you changed my world you'll never know 
I'm different now you helped me grow 

Verse 1 only the part after first Angel of mine to Second Angel of mine
