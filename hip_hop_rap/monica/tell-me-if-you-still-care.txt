Tell me, if you still care 
Tell me, if you still care 

Let me know 
Have you started to lose your love for me 
And if so 
Will you still continue to be on my side 

Tell me, if you still care 
About me Tell me that you care 
Tell me, if you still care 
About me 

Must we both, go on being confused 
And placing blame 
My heart knows, that you're my number one 
Do you feel the same way too 

Tell me, if you still care 
About me Tell me 
Tell me, if you still care Will you still care for me baby 
Oh yes 

Yes, I know, that I still love you 
You're forever on my mind 
And it's so hard to let go, what I feel for you 
You blow my mind 
But you captured all my love with your sweetness 
And you gave it to me baby, from your heart 
Oh, so if we really care for each other 
Then tell me baby, why are we apart, yeah 

Tell me, if you still care That you still care 
About me About me 
Tell me I wanna know if you still care 
Do you feel the same way too Do you feel the same way baby, for me 

Tell me, if you still care Will you hold me and will you kiss me 
About me Can you tell me 
Tell me, if you still care Will you hold me and will you kiss me baby 
Can you tell me Do you feel the same way too 

Tell me, if you still care 
Listen to my heart beat 
When you hold me, when you kiss me 
If you still care Can you tell me
