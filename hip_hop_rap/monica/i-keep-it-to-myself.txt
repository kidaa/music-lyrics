I looked at you a thousand times
This time when I looked at you
There was something new
How could I be so blind
We shared our secrets in the dark
Though we were only friends
I don't know when the feeling changed
Within my heart
Baby, oooo I keep it to myself
Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you
Oooo the harder it gets
But you don't know the love I'm feelin'
Oooo I keep it to myself
Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you
Oooo I don't wanna push you away
'Cause no one makes me feel like you do
I dream of you all through the night
Holding you tenderly
Right here wrapped in my arms so tight
But when I start to tell you how I feel
You tell me 'bout someone new who's right for you
If you only knew my love's for real
Baby, oooo I keep it to myself
Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you
The harder it gets
But you don't know the pain I'm feelin'
Oooo I keep it to myself
Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you
Oooo I don't wanna push you away
'Cause no one makes me feel like you do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
Then we both could be together forever
So why do I hide all my feelings inside
If I know you're the only one for me
The deeper that it gets
The harder that I fall
Baby, oooo I keep it to myself
Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you
Oooo the harder it gets
'Cause no one knows the pain I'm feelin'
Oooo I keep it to myself
Don't you ever leave me, you know baby
Oooo I don't wanna push you away
Don't you ever go away from me, baby
I love you baby
Love you crazy
I love you baby
And I love you crazy
[Chorus until fade]
