Who's textin' his phone?
I'm bought to go 
All in this thang again
Why you keep slippin'?
Oh really?

Get yo hands off

Girl you already know
Oh yeah
He's signed, sealed, delievered
He belngs to me, yeah
And I'll show up
At ya front door

He's my man
And I don't play this, yeah
'Cause he's seen 
All the crazy things
That I do
Hey, hey
If I find out
You're the one disrespecting
His phone
I'm coming, coming, coming
Straight after you
Boy, I don't play these games

[Hook:]

Ch-ch-checked
Checks his 
Black-ber-er-er-ry
Yup, that's me, me

That checks his phone
When he falls asleep
Early in the morn'

Betta have a co-co-code
In yo phone
And lemme alone
WIth ya 
Black-ber-er-er-ry
I'm the one 
That checks
Yup, that's me, me

[2nd Verse:]

'Cause I already 
Got the code to ya phone

Seen the thangs

So why you
Keep on, keep on
Playin' around

[Repeat Hook 1x]

[B-Section:]
Pictures that's 
On yo phone
I listen to your voicemail
When you leave home
You lookin' real mad
'Cause I broke your code
Don't feel bad about it
You already know

[Bridge:]
So 'bout 5, 6, 7, 8
You stayed out late
Tried to be slicker
Still wanna play
But I know better
I knew right
Out the gate
And I ain't
Bein' ya fool

It's too late
I gotta make a move
I'mma bout to bounce
And you about
To lose
You can take back
All of the shoes
What? Not all of the shoes

[Repeat Hook 1x]

I'll break the code
And I'll call them back
You a liar
And I don't want you 
No more
And I'm walkin' out 
The door
Boy, bye-bye
Bye-bye
