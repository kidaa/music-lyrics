I'VE BEEN THINKING

ABOUT ALL THE LONELY NIGHTS

I'D BE WAITING PATIENTLY,

 MY LOVE WAS BLIND

I COULDN'T SEE THAT,

YOU HAD NO LOVE IN YOUR HEART FOR ME

IN YOUR EYES,

 I CAN SEE,

YOU'VE BEEN ACTING UNFAITHFULLY

AND I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE,

DON'T LOOK BACK,

BECAUSE YOU'RE HISTORY

SO BABY GO JUST WALK AWAY "I AINT GONNA CRY"

TO MAKE YOU STAY,

YOU'LL COME RUNNING BACK TO ME SOME DAY

BUT BABY I'LL BE GONE

ANOTHER NUMBER,

I DIDN'T RECOGNISE

TOO MANY CHANCES FAR TOO MANY LIES

SECRET MOMENTS,

TOO MANY RENDEZ-VOUS

LISTEN BABY WE ARE THROUGH

NOW I KNOW,

 I BELIEVE,

YOU'VE BEEN ACTING UNFAITHFULLY

AND I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE,

DON'T LOOK BACK BECAUSE YOU'RE HISTORY

SO BABY GO JUST WALK AWAY,

 I AIN'T GONNA CRY LIKE YESTERDAY

AND BABY YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE ME STAY
