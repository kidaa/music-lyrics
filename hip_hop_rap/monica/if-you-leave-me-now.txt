If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survive
Somehow
Baby when you're gone

Holding you close to me
Always made me feel so right
Love is fantasy
Sometimes it can change your life

Tell me what are you feeling?
Tell me you still care
But I can't help believing
You will not be there

If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survive
Somehow
Baby when you're gone

If you leave me now
Holding on to the mystery
I can fight
Somehow
I will carry on

You held me in extasy
Then you let me slip away
The things that you said to me
Made me think you'd always stay

But you can't fight the feeling
Every night and day
When it's over, it's over
There's nothing I can stay

If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survive
Somehow
Baby when you're gone

If you leave me now
Holding on to the mystery
I can fight
Somehow
I will carry on

Carry on, carry on
Hey...! carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on...!

Want to tell me Tell me what are you feeling?
Tell me you still care
But I can't help believing
You will not be there

If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survive
Somehow
Baby when you're gone

Want to tell me what are you feeling
I will survive
I will survive without you

Can't fight the feeling
Can't fight the feeling no more
Can't fight the feeling
Can't fight the feeling no more
Can't fight the feeling
Can't fight the feeling no more
