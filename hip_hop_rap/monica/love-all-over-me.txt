[Verse 1]
Must not have been paying attention 
I stepped right on it didn't even notice how deep I was 
I went from the ground to the top of the cloud 
And now as I look down I see where I fell into your arms 

[Chorus]
Now I got Love all over me 
Baby you touch Every part of me 
Ooh 
I got Love all over me 
And I don't want to get it off 
I'm completely covered up in your love 

[Verse 2]
Even my skin is changing ooooooo
I'm feeling warmer no more icey blue hearts for me 
You put the color back in my life 
And now where there was black and white 
you're becoming iridescent

[Chorus]
Now I got Love all over me 
Baby you touch Every part of me 
Ooh 
I got Love all over me 
And I don't want to get it off 
I'm completely covered up in your love 

[Bridge]
Before your love baby I was muddy 
So deep with pain till you took it from me 
You showered me with a new beggining 
Now I'm clean 
Took me by surprise when you ran up on me 
I came to life baby in that moment 
You put your hands on my heart and baby 
now it beats 

[Chorus]
Now I got Love all over me 
Baby you touch Every part of me 
Ooh 
I got Love all over me 
And I don't want to get it off 
I'm completely covered up in your love
