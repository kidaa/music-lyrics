Male 
Monica baby, I'm sorry 
I know I was wrong, but I think we can work it out 
Just try to hear me out 

Monica 
Nah, you hear me out 

Verse 1 
I gave you so much love, but you had to play with my affections 
My heart was in your hands, but you had to play with all my feelings 
You got your mack on, but now I'm gone 
Cause I'd rather be all alone 
Away from all these silly games 

Chorus 
I gave you no reason why 
Just said do your thing on the side 
But now I'm gone 
Cause it will never be the same 

You were busy kicking it with your boys 
Instead of taking care of your girl 
But now I'm gone 
Gone away from you 

Verse 2 
I thought I knew you well 
But you ran away, didn't care about me 
You told so many lies 
Thought you could run away from this thing called reality 
But I'm long gone, I got to go on 
There's someone waiting for me 
To love me honestly 

Chorus 
I gave you no reason why 
Just said do your thing on the side 
But now I'm gone 
Cause it will never be the same, yeah 

Your were busy kicking it with your boys 
Instead of taking care of your girl 
But now I'm gone 
I'm gone away from you, oh my boy, hey 

I gave you no reason why 
Just said do your thing on the side 
But now I'm gone 
Cause it will never be the same, naw 

You were busy kicking it with your boys You shoulda been taking care of your girl 
Instead of taking care of your girl 
But now I'm gone 
But now I'm gone, oh now I'm gone, now I'm gon' away from you 
Monica speaking 
You see, the things you did to me back then, I'm long gon' from it now 
Baby I gotta go my own way 
They say they say 
That you never miss a good thing 
Until it's gon' Until it's gone away
