If I told you
I'll be the one to make all your dreams true
If I gave you
All the things that make a man feel so good
If I made you
Commit to me before I give it to you
If I had to
I would change the world and make it feel love for you

[Chorus:]

If you do what say do
I promise we can do whateva'
You want to cause I want you
Say love me & I'm down 4 whateva'

[repeat]

[Verse 2]

Now that it's clear I hope you understand the way I'm feelin
And now that you're here you can't stop thinking of what I want to hear
Now that it's true I can stop holdin' back and do what I do
And when we're through I lay in your arms and say I love you

I believe we can be
Whateva we want to no matter the dilemma
And I believe that you will see it may take forever
But we finally got together
And I believe it will be all about us cause baby I love you
And then they will see what we mean
When we say we were together for eternity

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]

Tell me what happens when you think of me
Do you think of the things I'm feeling
Cause when I see you I start trembling
My knees start shakin' just glad to be with you
Tell me your love will always be with me
Promise me you would never leave
And then take me where I want to be
Cause I need you baby, I'm needing you crazy ohoh!I!!

[Chorus Out]
