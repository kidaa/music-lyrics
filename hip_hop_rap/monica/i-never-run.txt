I DID MY VERY BEST TO HELP YOU

I TRIED IN EVERY WAY TO MAKE YOU STOP

YOU CLOSED THE DOOR TO PROBLEMS

THAT YOU SAY ARE YOURS

YOU DON'T WANT ME AROUND

YOU'RE TOO PROUD TO SAY YOU NEED ME AND

I STAYED BESIDE YOU IN THE BAD TIMES

I KISSED YOUR EVERY STEP AND EVERY MOVE

I CAN'T PRETEND IT'S EASY TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU

YOU TOOK ALL MY AIR

AND YOU TOOK MY ENERGY

OUR LOVE WAS ONE THEN

WE WERE STRONG THEN

NO GHOST INVADED ALL OUR NIGHTS OF PASSION

DON'T BLAME YOURSELF

OH! BABY

DON'T BLAME ME

I'LL NEVER RUN IN THE NIGHT WITHOUT YOU

THE HANDS OF TIME HAVE NOW CHANGED DIRECTION

I'LL NEVER RUN I'M ALONE WITHOUT YOU

I'M IN A PRISON OF LOVE

A PRISON FULL OF OPEN DOORS

YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW I SUFFER

TO SEE YOU GOING DOWN A DANGER ZONE

YOU'VE LOST THE LOVING FEELING YOU HAD DEEP INSIDE

TAKE ANOTHER ROAD

YOU'RE IN TIME TO BUILD A HOME

REMEMBER ONCE HOW

YOU WERE STRONG AND

YOU HAD THE POWER

YOU COULD CLIMB A MOUNTAIN

DON'T LOSE YOUR SELF RESPECT

YOU WON'T BE FREE

I'LL NEVER RUN IN THE NIGHT WITHOUT YOU

THE HANDS OF TIME HAVE NOW CHANGED DIRECTION

I'LL NEVER RUN I'M ALONE WITHOUT YOU

I'M IN A PRISON OF LOVE

NEVER RUN WITHOUT YOU

I'LL NEVER RUN IN THE NIGHT WITHOUT YOU

I'M IN A PRISON OF LOVE

A PRISON FULL OF OPEN DOORS

A PRISON OF LOVE

I DID MY VERY BEST TO HELP YOU

I TRIED IN EVERY WAY TO MAKE YOU STOP

I'M IN A PRISON BABE

I'M IN A PRISON BABE

I'LL NEVER RUN WITHOUT YOUR LOVE BABE

I STAYED BESIDE YOU IN THE BAD TIMES

I KISSED YOUR EVERY STEP AND EVERY MOVE

I'M IN A PRISON BABE

I'M IN A PRISON BABE

I'LL NEVER RUN WITHOUT YOUR LOVE BABE
