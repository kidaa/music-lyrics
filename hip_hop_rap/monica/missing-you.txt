Verse 1: 
Didn't think I'd be without you 
Didn't think that I would see 
Didn't think that I would lose my love 
How could this happen to me 
I must have took for granted 
That you would always be there baby, believe 

Sometimes I sit and wonder 
When everything is over 
How can I go on 
Knowing that you're gone 
Sometimes I sit and wonder 
When everything is done 
Will I ever get over you being my love 

Chorus: 
The only one for me 
Wanting you so much 
That I don't know what to do 
Strung out on your love 
Baby, I been missing you 
Crazy for your touch 
Lonely without you 
I be missing you so much, yea 

Verse 2: 
Can't take one night without you 
Don't wanna do anything 
But sit around and think of 
How I want you with me 
Just can't erase these feelings 
Somehow I know that time will make it better 

Sometimes I sit and wonder 
When everything is over 
How can I go on 
Knowing that you're gone 
Sometimes I sit and wonder 
When everything is done 
Will I ever get over you being my love
