Chorus: 
I should I should 
Make a move, but I won't 
I know you probably think something is wrong 
Knew that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night 

Monica - Verse 1: 
Saturday Night 
Feeling kinda light 
I wanna get close to you and let you call me your baby 
Know it ain't right 
It's just the first night 
Sitting here looking and it's driving me crazy 
Knew it was wrong for feeling this way 
The thought of giving in on the first date 
Couldn't let go it stayed on my mind 
At the end of the night I had to decide 
I was thinking... 

Repeat Chorus 2x 

Monica - Verse 2: 
My body's telling me yes 
You put me to the test 
But I don't know how much longer I can keep my composure 
Trying my best to deal with all of this 
But at the same time I can feel us getting closer 
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong 
And look how we are carrying on 
Trying to say things to get me to stay 
But my watch is telling me it's getting too late 
I'm thinking... 

Repeat Chorus 2x 

JD: 
Tonight little kiss touch 
We ain't gotta do all of that stuff 
I'm just sitting here trying to chill with you 
We ain't gotta rush 
I just wanna ball with you 
In and out the mall with you 
Out of town on the phone all night call with you 
Cheat Cheat 
Baby I do my shit correct 
You and me just met 
You ain't supposed to be ready yet 
Cause u don't know if I just want sex 
And I don't know if you want my checks 
Even though u probably expect for me to be kissing on your neck 
Now Baby 

R.O.C: 
If you show me yours 
I'll show you mine 
I see u get hot and I know it's time 
At 69 we can draw the line 
Or you could give me yours and I'll owe you mine 
When I meet the girl 
Creep the girl 
I freak the girl, I please the girl 
If you need the girl, man keep the girl 
Better hope R.O.C. don't see the girl 
If I should I should make a move 
Make it smooth 
Take her to that crib 
Lay her back put her in a groove 
Make her ahh, make her ooh 
Cause money come money go 
So do a honey though 
Love when they go "how low?" 
Front, back, to the floor 
Now keep on working that 
Where Jersey at? Where Jersey at? 

Repeat Chorus 2x 

Bridge: 
If u want me 
You got to know me 
And if you want my love you gotta wait my love 
Baby that's the way it's got to be 
Get to know me so we can do this 

Repeat Chorus til the end
