To get out of a bad situation
To get out this relationship

I promise you he'll never change
I know you really want him to
So all the things he promises
I hope you don't expect him to do

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me

You hate when I step off with honeys and rabies break
Who sayin' I want a baby chase, you can't relate
Pump your brakes, mami, please 'cause you buggin' me out
And treat me worse than them streets, it's like doggin' me out
But I could look into your eyes and see you achin' inside
You hope I da-da-da-da-da-da-da
