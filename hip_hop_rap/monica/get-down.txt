Verse 1: 
I don't want to make this sound so cold 
But every now and then I'm gonna let you know, ohh 
There's gotta be something givin' to me 
All you need to know is that I'm a fly young lady 

So do what you got to do if it's me you chose 
But I got the oohhh's baby, yah hear ohh 
I'm gonna give up some time if it's worth my while 
Cause it's my world, I'm playin' my game 

Chorus: 
You gotta get downecho 
With the way I'm runnin' things 
Or you won't be aroundecho 
You gotta get down with me, me 

You gotta get downecho 
With the way it's gotta be 
Turn your frown to a smileecho 
You gotta get down with me, me 

You gotta get downecho 
Ooh baby, oh you gotta get down with me 
Downecho 
Hey... 
Downecho 
Down, umm yeah 
You gotta get down with me, me 
Verse 2: I've heard your kinda nice what's yours now it's that slow??? 
Take the time, learn the ways then we can roll 
Have you ever met a girl that knows her thang 
Lookin' kinda fly but baby can you swang 

So do what you got to do if it's me you chose 
But I got the oohhh's baby, I got the oohs baby 
I'm gonna give up some time if it's worth my while 
Cause it's my world, I'm playin' my game
