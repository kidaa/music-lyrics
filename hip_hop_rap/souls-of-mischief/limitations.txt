[Opio]

Understand this man is the grand-est
The mighty dreaded, niggaz step and get beheaded
Shredded, left a battered broken man
Chosen hand busted from the tussle from the mic which I ignite
Like a pyromaniac don't play me that's
not recommended, you're winded your girl lays me back
and I attack the twat viciously
Got it twitchin, she's a bitch to the dopefiend beat
Hope we meet in the next lifetime
For the strife I'm, the nigga with the better rhyme
Hoes think I'm adorable, MC's think I'm oracle
Foolish mortal, I got the flows so call your crew
And crush the earth's crust because I bust
Thunderous, I'm breakin niggaz down to dust
The rhyme sorceror forces you to shout my praises
Phenomenal phrases hit you like exploding razors

[A-Plus]

Now who put the West up on the map?
Perhaps you should run laps, you're wack with a stack of dumb raps
Thumbtacks mark your headquarters
You're dead when I slaughter, and now your head's leaking red water
You shoulda been a donor, I'm prone to bone ya hoe
Though she know I can flow, cuz I showed her
And now she's up on my shit, I'm slick
I rhyme quick, and I'm the shit, dick
Hieroglyphics in the house like punishment
Who is running shit, A-Plus is the one to get
foul, if you think I'm flippin on the man with the skills
Niggaz get the dills, still
Hieroglyphics sound the lights, surround the mics
I pound the lights cuz they haven't found the light
But I never taught ya discipline, feel my fist again
If it's in your face, get a taste, cuz you commit the sin

MC's should know their limitations, their limitations
MC's should know their limitations

[Tajai]

*singing* When Captain Tajai throws his weight it's hard
The verbs they scourge I fly nerds while I be fine
Put on your radar, I don't stay far
That's why men are noid, I irritate like hemmaroids ouch
You made the proper preperations, I still ate ya
I hate ya, I rate the
mindstate of niggaz that I'm greater, none of that later
We can do this I wreck blocks like Brutus
It's not a chore ta, make you come up shorter
Cuz niggaz know I'm sure to serve without takin no orders
So here's a tip from the hip to your dips
Get with the man who rips, stop being stalled by them drips
I'll do you swell, I got better aim than Willie Tell
I rung so let me ring your bell
DING-DONG!  My sing song swells like a Samolian
stuck in my pocket, I simply rock it

[Casual]

Call it splat on your face when you try to face the match
You're tripping you're slipping you're sliding off my fly blend
of wording, soon to be hurting, a nerd teen rabbit
Peace to the niggaz who got my back and
Everyone else can get the dills
I hit your skills up, like my tag
You rag and boast about your coast but it really don't phase me
You're style's lazy, you must be drinkin that Crazy
My thinking's phat and it pays me!
Your days be decreasing be-cause we beats men
I seen at least ten enemies daily!
But what you'll get bold, and try to play me maybe that
imbecile, while my bat, is sensible
His brain I got ta beez giving niggaz lobotimes
I trife with these, individuals criminals of my own rap
On behalf of Phesto, I like to laugh

MC's should know their limitations, their limitations

Yeah, now I got something to say, on the behalf of Hieroglyphics
This the D-E-L, and umm, I'm sick of all you weak-ass
booty-ass motherfucking rappers
And uhh, next time I see you on the motherfucking street
I'ma bust your motherfucking nose
Uhh, fuck you!!  Peace
