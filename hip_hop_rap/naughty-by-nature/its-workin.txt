It's workin', It's workin'
Party people if you're ready to rock let me hear you scream!

I play for keeps, sidewalks and streets, we reign and we pop, and daily
routine sweeps.
It's the fanatic, can't kick the habit, so there you have it, I'm a
addict.
When I'm near the mike I gots to grab it. Rip the system to shreds, grab
the braids in my head.
Everybody get lifted, remember the rhyme said. This is your introduction
to the new episode.
With the Double I countin' down to explode.
Naughty kicked in the door, here come 235 more, livin' rotten to the
core
everybody to the right, cause all I got left is my flow. 
I'm floatin' with Boogie Beat fishin' in a record ocean. Uh oh, I guess
it's going' down, not now, right now.
So I got down with the git down for Illtown.  Figure it's the fine
fanny,
I miss my mammy.
And you could ask my uncle Randy, I'm grateful for my granny nanny
that's
my mother's mammy.  Two tittle brothers with different fathers but we're
still family. 
Forget how rough I had it, let's see how smooth it gets. Cuz I might
wind
up doing that same old cruddy shit.
Like clockin', sellin' rocks in my neighborhood.  Back cockin',
buckshottin', your ass is shot.

[CHORUS]
It's workin', It's workin'
