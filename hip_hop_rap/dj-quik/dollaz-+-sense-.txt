If you haven't heard of me I wouldn't be suprised
I bet you know my relatives their names will never die
My mother is a saint and my brother is a God
But all I am is Jesus' brother Bob
CHORUS
Jesus' brotehr Bob, Jesus' brother Bob
A nobody relative of the son of God
If only I'd been born just a little sooner
I'd be more than the brother of God junior
I have to pay the ferry to cross the Galilee
But not my brother, no not him, he walks across for free
I finally get to work 'bout a quarter after nine
Already he's turning water into wine
CHORUS
One day when I was home I heard a mighty roar
There were a thousand people right outside the door
Help us Jesus, help us  came the cheering from the mob
Then they got a look at me,  Oh nuts, it's only Bob.
CHORUS
He died upon the cross, I thought that I was free
Finally people would get to
know me for me
This was my big chance to
finally get ahead
The next thing you know
he's rising from the dead
CHORUS
Bob
