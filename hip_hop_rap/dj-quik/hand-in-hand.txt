Let the wind blow
Let the grass grow
But don't let her go

Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
Woah-oh

Let the moon glow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow

Well I just got to know
Let me please know oh oh oh
Know she'll be a part of our life
Know she'll be a part of our life
Forever

Let the bees make honey
Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give them sunshine tomorrow

But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her tell me now

Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall
Let the grass grow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow

But don't take her out of my life
Please keep her a part of our life
