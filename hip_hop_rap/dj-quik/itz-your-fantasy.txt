I was a little unhappy
and yet a little bit stronger
and I wasn't gonna take things as they come

You are a little unhappy
or did I say that already
you do a very good job in messing up

First you name it
then I tag it yeah
hey we're a good combination I must say

what if I tend to lose this time
I can't be who I was for old times' sake
Well I've changed beyond a doubt
and I wonder if it lasts,
if it lasts you
you as in I

I was a little unhappy
and a little bit stronger
and I wasn't gonna take things as they come
