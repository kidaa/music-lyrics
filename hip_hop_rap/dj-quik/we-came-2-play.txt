It doesn't seem to matter what you say
you will never feel the same
It doesn't seem to matter what you do
I will fall in love with you

And everyday I think we grow apart
I guess I saw it from the start
I guess I knew that you and I won't be
It doesn't mean that I can't dream about you

Think about you still you complete a part of me
I never knew I had to fill
I'd give you anything
like the times I'd sing on the phone to you
was not the easiest thing to do
You know its true, you know it could have been this way and
I swear by my heart there is nothing on earth that will keep us apart

And all I have I swear I give to you
All that I say you and I will begin this way
When you fall in love with me

It doesn't seem to matter what I say
You will never be the same
It doesn't seem to matter what you do
I will fall in love with you and everyday
I wonder how you feel if your sincerity is real
I took the time I softly called your name
I know I should've screamed instead

Do you miss meaning everything to me
'cause not a day goes by if I had kissed you it just might
have changed our destiny 'Cause we were meant to be
I'm standing on one knee won't you please just marry me
You know its true You know it should have been this way.

You know i swear on my heart, There is nothing on earth
hat could keep us apart
And all I have I swear I give to you, All that I say,
You and I would begin this way if you fall in love with me
like I fell in love with you

Doesn't mean that I can't dream

You say you were on your way
Make it all come true
Swear to god I'd die for you
And give you anything
Like a memory
And all the times we've had
No I'd never take it back
You know it's true
You know it should have been this way

And I swear by my heart
there is nothing on earth that won't keep us apart
And all I have I swear I give to you
All that I say
you and I would begin this way
if you fell in love with me
