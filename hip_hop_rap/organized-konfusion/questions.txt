Prince Poetry:
  what, nigga you can consider it the bomb
  if i spit on it
  get on it
  ride for a little bit
  feel how your inner get
  from internet
  intellect
  vibes that I'm sendin it
  now your soul bubblin' brown sugar so you remember it
  legitimate
  imminent
  crash course for illiterate
  from ???? to heavenly
now some pop some shit
but labels get the big shit from sales
45 projects
keepin it naughty like treach
