[narrator]
Where most niggaz would stop, he would JUST be gettin started
Go all out
I seen people stop in mid-stride, reverse, change directions
Go through buildings to avoid passing him
[Organized Konfusion - mostly Prince Poetry]
Nine times out of ten, a nigga wanna shine
But nobody shines brighter than the light Organized
Extra-tight, one hundred percent, drama full armor
The persona is to ";Crush Kill Destroy"; the bad karma that
hums superb, lyrics emerge from the slums
of the latest gun drug runs, fun feds and dum-dums
Priority and confidential
Organized mission is rippin any instrumental, believe that
[Pharoahe Monch]
Wa-wa-wa-wa-watch me-me-me get-get me-me so-so-in-in-incred-
-di-di-di-dibly-bly-bly ov-bly-bly over your head, head
I shed styles like reptile skins
While nigga rhyme the SAME, rip beginnin to the ends
of they LP's, try to tell me shit
With they pussy-ass poems and they bullshit bullshit skits
Shit I'm hitting you harder than Nancy Kerrigan on the shin
FUCK IT if niggaz can't comprehend
[Prince Poetry]
Fuck yo, consider me iller than ill, with skill, nigga chill
Still, some sleep, too deep, not to get bitten
when I reveal technique - wherever I speak
I'm goin in for the kill, for real
Future street prodigy follow the model is hollow
Speak your name if your lyrics hold sorrow - ain't that a damn shame?
Konfusion with the K and whole effects like rain
with acid from tomorrow, Prince Poe Bizarro
maintains the status, apparatus throughout the stratus-phere
Here stands one of the biddest
City crispy rhyme rebels clear like crystal
O.K. be the initials, ghetto dope officials
