South Side's a town with a lot of hustle and bustle
A kid got stuck, for a buck under the trussle
Died with pride, he thought he had a big heart muscle
He fought back, but the attack was brutal
Futile to his survival and the event that his crew will
seek revenge on the assailants who rushed him
They crushed him, snuffed the life all out of his body
He had friends a Benz with rims by Gotti
Guys wanted to beat him, girls wanted to greet him
Kids wanted to be him when they saw him in the Coliseum
Lots of cash hoppin fast on the Avenue
Pump up your system loud, and he'll laugh at you
Cause under the Tec is a gooseneck
and a Glock 9, when he stops at the light
Pumpin rides into the top in ...
South Side repeat 10X
I grew up on the rough side of town, kids play stick-up
Playing the game of survival going Uptown to pick up
Supportin the taste, with leathers and bamboos and black Timbs
Benz parked, at the curb while puffin herb word
Cruisin, one-six-oh, with the lean
sportin BV's on the Beamer with the Italian wintergreen interior
while the Alpine pump, you get open
Hoppin hopin to catch them all open, girls scopin as you unlock
Now you gotta go gotta go
Hoppin down Merit to get back to the four-oh
Back in the days Queens never got props
but South Side had citywide respect plus knockouts
Forty, Baisley, Suptin, Merit
Queens wack step back I don't wanna hear it I'm from
South Side 16X, scratching intermixed
Projectiles are fittin, inside of a clip and
personally there's no particular name that's written
on the side of a slug, damn it's bugged
when pretty women begin to bend over a drug
She used to be the type of girl that was flashy
Now the scars from the concrete make her knees look ashy
Cops constantly stay on high speed chases
Trying to remember faces from previous arrest cases
Bulletproof vest is the hottest items to invest in
shots fired one was hit with the hollow-tip and it caved his chest in
Kids are gathered around him coffin quiet
Softly they're standin cause there's baby left as an orphan
Cause the life of an illegal entrepeneur
is more than a rag-a-ma-jaga a Scorpio buy my cure
South Side repeat 4X
Your man wants to get rid of ya
Cause now you're the number one neighborhood pharmeceutical distributor
How could you ever expect this
from your man that he would plant product inside of your Lexus
Today you're having lunch with a cutie
You gotta hunch you're the type of brother that's moody
So instead you drive a sterling, lime green
to match the colors inside of your eightball sherling
So today he escapes fate, to live another day
to pick up scale weight inside of a ghetto
Inside of the ghetto, cars gather together
Gettin ready to hop, under the summer weather
Armor All glistenin in the sun, it's four cars
and they're each two deep, but you still find it necessary to carry a gun
Hoppin to the beach, with a Jeep
full of chinese cut broads passin by perpetrators
perpetratin frauds, you're on the beach, playin cards
Thinkin about, pickin up a convertible Saab
As the sun sets, you all jet inside of the ride
But your mentality flips, cause you gotta get back to the
South Side repeat 16X
