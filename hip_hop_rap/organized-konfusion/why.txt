So yo, why you trying to play me though?
	Out like a sucker Repeat 4x
[Pharoahe Monch]
You're sneaking around like a sneaker baby, what's the beeper for?
Used to do my chores, now you're acting like a whore
Phones at my grip with you off to the store
For now, you don't love me no more?
Hey, by the way who's Curt?
Left a message on my machine said you didn't come to work
You AWOL from the job, plus who's Rob?
The way you're acting, I think you've been slobbing him
Sometimes I swear I think about robbing 'em
But my papa told me never to snuff no girls
You give 'em diamond, jewels, furs, pearls
Rings and shoes and cars and things
From time to time I wanna diss her
You couldn't play me if I cheated like Amy Fisher
And dismiss her from the courtroom in a Yugo
You know, something like Joe Buttafuco
Well deep inside my heart, the pain still stings
When I think back and remember I was gonna swing her a ring
For her fing finger, yes I used to bang her
Like ";inga binga bunga"; but I'm out like  Philip Summers

I reminice back when I was swinging with Mish pretty young thing
she got a kick outta, my jeep and a meal at Burger King
And a shotta, ??? down with my maturity
Getting papers from Port Authority doing security
Uh, she just used to climb up in my whipper whip
Just to stress a nigga quick, young she's on a ego trip
Quit being ";ha ha"; I had to stop the pigeon
Step, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living
So I met a girl around the way from the uptown
Set, we used to drown in sweat, uh
She was my dollar til I lost my 9 to 5
She started dissing listen pretend then shitting on my pride
She tried to crush my pride so cut off to the next
Uh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects
Gossiping with the next about the next
Loved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet Meow
It's major in a which, when she wanted to flow
Flowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows
Doing a demo, demo, dembo, dembo
Dembo you can't front, you used to bust a load on Prince Po
And fall fast asleep into the morn
Girlfriend started flipping, so yo Prince had to be gone
I'm just another brother trying to get around the Feds
And keep my mental state, no matter what it takes
	So yo, why you trying to play me though?
