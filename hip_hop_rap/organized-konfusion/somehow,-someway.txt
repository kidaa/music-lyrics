Chorus: repeat x2
Somehow, Someway
We be comin up wit funky fly shit
Like Every single day
[Prince Poetry]
Check it
Intelligent wordz, iz colaz
Inside of this rap visual, liquid dye
Focus, clistion unlike baptism
I bless souls thru the worldz second religion
From the left With angles to enlarge the prizm
Prince Po, I, out of the south-side slums
Claimin spots around all these hypo-critical tongues
Repeatin tha same topic, misleadin the sea topic
Wit 2 yearz outta da picture
I still rock it and rock well
A level that my stiggy gets you gel what
I strickly international ghetoo, clientel
Freaky like James Bond, wit infra-red views inject propellin
Was a 7, my steps, and wit da few 
I make power jewels, drop jewelz, wit da crewz
Inside a, outta da eyez of god can't lose
batter and bruise crewz
and let the heat spark, the feuls
Got ya boyz cryin while youre stretched out in front of da church fews
Foolz hit da dance floor, to shake shoes
Intect ya like a hip hop monsta who sucks Oooohhhs
Outta da power that I used that I used ta sock prower
Want more, I stick ya butt naked and raw
Chorus
[Pharoahe Monch]
Only inches beyond my eyez, lord hail out the soul
Of a nigga who fights the lyrical which's inside himself
Pharoahe, egar to see febal intermediate MCs
Immediately, to leaded, repeatiatly
Y'all know the unpresidented without herb
every single word'll be verbally demented
Presented, so that when it desinigrates
unsentaments, are meninetated
Standin aloneit gets you tinimented
It's it bug how I bust lyrical slugs
And thugs that mug niggaz for loot and sell drugz
When the band gets struck, by thesis
I'm only rollin wit da most superior Profile, to my species, see my thesis
Release these bombz by all meanz
Yes, attack the mic rapz until itz a crack fiend
Mase the bass with aids and misplaced the vaccine
Pharoahe pullin out on the pole
To compare cause ??? wit scriptures that I wrote and know
My physical form iz like Nam and sane like Sadaam Hussein buit still calm
Chorus
