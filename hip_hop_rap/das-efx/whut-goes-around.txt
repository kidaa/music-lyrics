Intro/Chorus: Das EFX, miss jones
Aiyo yo, whut go around, no doubt come around
				Comes around, comes around

Another day, another plot to scheme
Stock to cream, kiggity-can't stop my team
				Can't stop my team
Verse One: Dray, Skoob
Well iggity-open up, let me in so I could begin
Roll film at the slim trim ready to win
I got the what?, head rocker, getcha tipsy like vodka
Don't mean to shock ya but I operate like a doctor
Show 'n' tell, excell past the start
Makin grand with my man Pushin luxury cars
Rock an ill rap word, still strapped wit the rhymes
Diggy Das blow your mind, no doubt, one of a kind
Niggity-no digga, the tiggity-tongue flipper, the funk ripper
The bum sticker, d' ??? what nigga
I'm iggity-out to make a bundle in all spots
like the tiggity-tunnel, we start bleedin from the concrete
jiggity-jungle, we holdin it down, son, no diggedy
Niggas be wettin the flow, wet the flow, slippery
Hickory dickory, what up doc? We bust shots
Niggity-nuff props to all my people prayin up top
Chorus x2
Verse Two: Dray, Skoob
Yo

See we do it all night just to keep the crowd high

So swim or drown, kid, kiggity-come up short or hold it down
Biggity-been to mad places, seen all these changin faces
Court cases, and riggity-rip shows for all races
Son, I diggity-do my thing for the CREAM, the higgity-hip-hop fiend

Figgity-finger on the trigger, vision on the sparrow
The diggy dark shadow, holdin it down and camouflage your town
Chorus
