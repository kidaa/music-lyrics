Verse 1: Dray
Well I'm suprised, open your eyes because it's me, G

So hi-ho I'm Silver, I'm makin the pape's when I kicks

For the chicks, I be on my good foot, you get that ass kicked
So yibbida yabber yoozy, [fuck] that floozy Suzy Chapstick
So here boy, here boy, come get some, it's Krazy
I'm swingin my Dukes of Hazard just like ???? on Daisy

They oughta be usin my terms for sperm and makin babies
Hey ladies, I know my A-B's, I'm makin CD's
I heard you was eatin your spinach boy, you better be eatin your Weeties
Comprendo, so let your friends know I'm losin my noodle
cos when it be time to doodle, I lose my scruples, ask my pupils
I'm the slippery slang slipper, quick to clip a QB

Hangin loosely, oh yes G, niggas be wantin to test me

Verse 4: Books
Hear ye, hear ye, don't look any further G, see he here is
Still mic checkin [shit], still Dead Serious
Hello there, I didn't go nowhere, whatup with the static G?
I be damagin niggas' fronts like them creases in your cavity
For real though, jumpin jallopy's, I'm rougher than hockey 
I drop these bumpy cos my style is knock-kneed
So me and my-a, I'm flyer than the witches sweeper
Jeepers, keep ya jump, jump into it like Aretha
I Boogie Bang bang the thang like a cramp style slant
Niggas be tryin to hang but they can't G
Will agains, I'm gettin elegant with the skill again
It don't mean a thang if I ain't got my philly, kid
