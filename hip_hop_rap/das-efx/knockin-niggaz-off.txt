Chorus x3:
We just be knockin niggaz off, knockin niggaz out
Verse 1: Dray, Skoob
Well let me get busy on the track one time, who's this?
It's diggity Das EFX and, yo, you know we never miss never miss uh
Cos son you know I get mine a day
I don't play so hey, check the shit I say Dray
I'm comin thru with the flow and, yo, my nigga Boogie Banger
Flipped from here all the way to Alabama
And, yo, you know I gots to get nice, precise
and plus I get the slice from dice
So Boogie Banger, son I know you got my back
React, cos on the track you never come wack
Yo the Boogie Banger bringin danger to the rap game no doubt
I kick a rhyme and rip the spine out'cha back frame
Yeah, I'm at the peak of my career
and wacked niggaz ain't got a motherfuckin prayer
I swear this day must be my lucky why?
cos niggaz wants ta be me and bitches wanna fuck me
Chorus x2
Verse 2: Skoob
Sufferin suckertash, another smash is in the makers, niggaz hatin
my stiggity styles, they bringin home the bacon
It's the East Coast niggaz, we rolls niggaz like whatevers
My place or your place, northface and levers
Hot 'n' tated, I ain't afraid of you
MC's who wanna test me, so let's see what you made've
Put ya batter up and you'll get your batter shot
No matter what season, I'm comin thru, ha
Chop-fullin nut-swingin the funk worker
I quick to flip a mic just like a wave can flip a surfer
I'm first to rope a dragon, and the oki-choki style be a forgotta
For nutta, when I heat up the flow I spit lava
Packin 'istol that cream your army like some ??? crystal
Wipin out MC's like I had the fuckin swiffle
It's too tragic, fat like blue magic, you faggot
I bring your whole fuckin crew saggy
Chorus x4
Verse 3: Dray
Yah, uh, yo
Well um, here I come so do me if you can
but I'ma end your shit like PDP did MC Sham yeah yeah nigga
I keep it goin, son you know I never stop
We hold it down the block and got the real hip-hop
Now cock your Glock and money bust a few
The crew - it's diggity Das EFX I though you knew
Chorus x6
