Intro/Chorus:
No diggedy - can I kick a rhyme for your mind?
No diggedy - do we bring it real e'rytime?
No diggedy - can I kick a rhyme for your mind?
No diggedy - Das EFX we rip it e'rytime
*repeat*
Verse 1: Dray, Books
Yo yo
Well biggity back from the gutter, ya beat the butter flow comin at'cha
Check the rapture that I miggity manufacture
Body snatcher, here to throw the pitch again
Gotta switch again because we back up in this bitch again No doubt
We roll like Michelin, the rapper's know the pedigree
Flowin steadily, yo Boogie Banger rizzy ready G?
I'm miggity made of snakes-n-snails and rock Wally tails
jiggity joined by the balls in case all else fails
Higgity hails from the land of gunsling and I tell ya one thing
diggity Das EFX we run things, hunting
down hardcore clowns and love singers
and I got more styles than Brooklyn got drug slingers word up!
Police oppress me, MC's wanna stiggity stress me
Tickity talkin more trash than a Hefty
Heaven-to-Betsy when Dray spark the sess, we left
you faggot MC's marked for death
Chorus
Verse 2: Dray, Books
I line up rappers then I drop em like they're dominos No diggedy!
And naybody from their poppa to their momma knows No diggedy!
We got the flows to get ya hyper, plug up the mic-uh
phiggity-phone and then it's on because I'm just the type-uh
And ain't no diggedy, I flow until infinity, you must be kiddin me
ain't niggity nuttin gettin rid of me
Big up to PMD, forever gettin blunted
Flooded in the triple black Benz 500
I riggity rap like Saram from here to Pakistan
Me and my man came to kick styles out the can
Fridge you with the flow, yo it's the big chill
Ship all pounds plus stack my grants in a hill
So you better set the *?backra?* or ya head'll splat
I smiggity smoked the pot that called the kettle black
Provoke and get your jiggity jaw broke
B-K-L-Y-N we no joke!
Chorus
Verse 3: Dray, Books
Well yo the 1 is for them suckers, the 2 is for my shortys
the 3 is for my knuckers puffin els and crackin 40's
Diggy Das EFX you know the text we never slackin
We back and fliggity flex a nigga, check the rappin
Niggas be actin shady!!!!
so I got eyes behind my back and I biggity black the 80
Yo we crazy as they come smokin blunts by the carton
Beg your pardon but MC's is a pain like ????
Sharpen up your skills, it's on the real to break em down
My sound is strictly hardcore underground
