The shit the man kick'll make ya fuckin ass sick
I bring you from the pit and never quit cos it's the Krazy
Poppin all this shit cos his rhymers don't amaze me
It pays me to rock it so why not I stop it
I make it by the bucket so fuck it, I stock it
It's just for safe keepin so when I'm sleepin I sleep safe

Back in the place I'm gettin stupid in ya sector

Fuckin flow to final, motherfuck the title
My nigga DJ Dice is on the vinyl motherfucker
That's my recital, kid I flipped it til the end
I bring it from the sewer , here my nigga come again
The Books in reverse kicks a verse
I'm takin it to ya face, I'm iggity on the case I persuit
to stomp an MC like grapes and then scrape em with the boot
I bring swing to the ring like Luke Doover
Diggity-got land like a cruiser, Pop Duke he rip a cougar
For pages, I kick it raw til my jaw caves in
Amazin and plus off-beat like caucasians
Me get done? Never son, I hold it down for 7-1-A
where niggas fuck around and where niggas lay
Ain't nuttin slim, I got game like Tim Hardaway
Fouls like the proudest so I'm labbin in RCA
Aw shit, I got you buggin, flippin that shit that you lovin
plus I got another back in the oven
Some heard the style and then construction on it
but they just touching on it, bitch ass niggas ain't got nuttin for it
C'mon, broke my blocks or I'll blow ya spot
I rock like that bald-headed nigga on Fox
So how we do? No shorts from niggas or they fuckin girl and what you
got?
more styles than the last got served no doubt
So if you wit me and you're higher than a hippie, hold tight
cos e'rything gon' be aight! No doubt
