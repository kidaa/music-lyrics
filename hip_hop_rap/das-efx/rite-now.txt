Verse One: Dray, Skoob
Diggity-drop the new talk, from Jersey and New York
We holdin down the fort in the sport, what y'all thought?
Diggy-Das what? Lick off shots and hip-hop
It don't stop, I riggity-rock blocks when my shit drop
Boogie Bang Banger, cock back the rap hammer
Bust grammar, I stay bent like a coathanger
NIGGITY-NO MANNERS Up in here with my skullie on
fully on, riggity-rockin fatigues like Desert Storm
Yo, figgity-face it, we lace it, far from basic
Taste it, shine like diamonds in ya bracelet
HIGGITY-HEY KID Me and my Squad about to blow
Let it go, briggity-bringin the hook and let em know
Hook
Verse Two: Skoob, Dray
Yo, yo
I bought a Glock off a Puerto Rock Where?
Off a block and fo' green back when I was 14
Now my thug's punk crilli, the thug willies
We're mack milli, cowardly cats get smacked silly
Wanna beef? Get back, on and the street get splashed
from your cheek, past your ass til your feet.....
Crab nigga duck shiggity-shots from the aimed Glocks
Fall on your head like raindrops til your brain pops
Yo yo
I got a chick that'll lie for me
die for me, shoot ya in your eye for me
Get high with me, the unfadeable, ungradeable
You wiggity-waste your time cos I'm unrateable
See, figgity-find me in the Benz on the backstreet
Listenin to Blackstreet, fuckin in the back seat
What? '98 thug mania, bring the pain to ya
And ain't no savin ya when I start blazin ya
