back up in the scene, 
here to make the green 
and niggaz out there know just what I mean

short and stocky 
never sloppy
the honeys wanna clock and knock me
It don't shock me,

Dollar dollar dollar place your bets across the table
one mo' time cuz its show time without the cable
holdin down the spot and any wack penetrators 
is fallin to the flames of my rap incinerators
I'm afraid I got some bad news for crews 
by the twos son it's hard like booze so don't snooze

the skunk derelict ghetto lyrical specialist
say yes its thick 
the restless clique
from PMD to fool with the Lexus whip
now true indeed a few MC's they just don't know what they doin
cuz when I smoke the blunt, nigga, 
they just had the blunt canoein'
so yo, now I gotta dis cause niggaz piss me off
the way that y'all be rhymin if you want like Doggie Diamond
Here it is...

A black Champion like my hoodie
