Yo it's the slick fuckin trick-tight nigga from the Heights again
I'm gettin nice again as the pussy's like *?Micalin?*
So I pretend to be somethin that you ain't
You got me laughin til the fuckin bank'll bust, I'll do ya somethin sick
I'm bad to the bone, gnaws at the gristle
Puttin the squeeze on niggas so what? fuck Mr Whipple
If you live along my end, yeah baby girl I might tickle c'mon
I drink Gold E like Fred D drank the ripple
Word to God, niggas wanna play hard rap-a-dosis
That shit got to go, I cock back, shot the flow POW!
CAUGHT, now hook em to the respirator drip
The shit bag to his hip while he vision in the escalator
Now play the humble in the tunnel with the bright light
at the end of it, word is bond, time to end this shit
Chorus:
Here we go
Here we go yo, time to get dumped
Yeah that's how it is yo and that's how it go
*repeat x3*
Well guess who's next up to flex, no need to introduce
We're holdin down the spot just like the pimps that wanna 40-deuce
So here's the story, kid you bore me, don't ignore me
You're gettin killed in my territory word up
You think ya clever son but you're never son
Gonna get a chance to fuckin call me like Edison
I think ya better run cos I'm comin at'cha
And what the fuck you gonna do when I catch ya
Ya little bastard ya get the last hit
When I blast it you're gonna end up in a fuckin casket
I kicks the mad shit, I come to show the flow
You're fuckin with a pro but yo I guess by now ya know, so
Chorus
Well now I got you niggas stumblin, I see you fumblin, kill the mumblin
Cos when I'm on the track I'm never wacked when I be rumblin
Like dis, like dat, I'm fatter than the fattest
Niggas wish they had this, they know my style's the fuckin baddest
You got the saddest but yo you're just a pussy
My fuckin girl'll make you do the wa-toosie
You need protection when in my section
With the injection, the number one in my fuckin collection
I blast off like a rocket, so don't knock it
til you try it, I come deep like a riot
Ya can't deny it, I keep it on lock
A 40 and a blunt motherfucker and you don't stop
I'm on the scene with the nicotine puffer
I gut ya clean and make ya fuckin spleen rupture
Nice with the ways is the dazed axe nigga
I know a lotta rap figures and pushin-crack niggas
Perhaps wacked niggas need to play the back step
I got styles with days but styles ain't even hatch-ed
I'm super fly hatin but never violatin
We use to smoke a pound a week but now we're gettin higher lately
Rhyme-sayers need prayers cos sniper's gettin hot
When you make the sign of the cross, X marks the spot
Ill clips to my ribs with my niggas to the side
3-80 stash in the 3-25
Oops I'm at the eight now, bees think I push
more rock than Mr Slay, I'm fat like Ricki Lake
Chorus
Here we go
Here we giddo, time to get diddo
That's how it is yo, axe how we go
Here we go
Here we go, time to get dough
That's how it is yo, axe how we go
Here we go
Here we go yo, time to get dough
That's how it is yo, that's how we go
Here we giddo, time to get diddo
That's how it is yo, act like we kniddow
