Comin straight from the sewer, I biggity-be's the rough slang slinger
Singer, dame look at me swing it like a swinger
I riggity-rock the miggity-microphone, I'm goin to rock it
Don't jock it, I'm quiggity-quick-quick, thiggity-thick, yo drop it
I'm flippin the flap so check out the rap, skills, ill ain't it?
I friggity-fry the funk so give me your tracks so I can train it
or drain it like Draino, *?this mako?*, cos I'm a
rhymer, I stiggity-stun the *?cuns like angina?*
Singin the soft drink, ya did finger or leg lock
Huh-tutz, spit, can I rock?
The finger-lickin, criggity-crispy chicken
Spiggity-spark the biggity-blunt style is what I'm kickin
So next up, I kiggity-call my nigga wit the slang
The iggity-ill paprika, yo speaker.......

Crack a 40, I smiggity-smoke nuff blunts that orgy
Bringin funk from Crown Heights straight to Californi
I-A, B, see me on the free
style, chill more props than Benny Hill, umm
Well I'll be god damned, they bringin me in the master mix
The nappy head, go betcha dog, question mark, asterisk
I flip up, bang, knock a baby out your ????
The figgity-funk, triple packs an Uzi in my zip-up
Remember the time I ripped it, smacked it, flipped it
You're figurin I was a tip, tip so I kicked it
Hook:
Straight from the sewer, straight from the sewer
			";Noth-nothin can save ya";
*repeat x3*

So light, camera, action......

Tiggity-tap a livin in the lapper
The ghetto, leakin the nigga' petrol as I let go
My verbs with the *?lecko?* from Bismore to Plepto
The umm, boogity woogity Books can make ya clock turn
I riggity-rocks the spot just like my cock butts burn
I friggity-freaks the ill rap, I'm still strapped, don't test me
I pops shit, pop tarts and piggity-pop cherries
Correct, G, my style is fat so I swung it
Want it? The riggity-roughneck Brooklyn nigga brung it
Hook x1 1/2
