Cant put my finger on it 
Its running through my brain 
Cant put my finger on it 
Im losing time again 
Cant put my finger on it 
No stopping up this hole 
Cant put my finger on it 

I sit 
and watch the world go by 
I wait 
and I dont even know why 
You know I listen to your voice 
it runs through my brain 
and then I wonder 
what is it I was thinking 

Cant put my finger on it 
No stopping up this hole 
Cant put my finger on it 
Im losing control 
Cant put my finger on it 
Got no place to hide 
Cant put my finger on it Now something seems so terrible and wonderful in one 
You know I feel the need to learn to run 
I jump so high that my feet touch the sky 

Cant put my finger on it 
Its running through my brain 
Cant put my finger on it 
Im losing time again 
Cant put my finger on it 
No stopping up this hole 
Cant put my finger on it
