Flower days have to wait 
sunshine through the filtered haze 
we settle down and wonder 
about the rhymes we've known since nine 
how they've changed the way we see 

In the dark you and me 
We could feel but not see 
and we were so young 
and we were in need 
but we just couldn't care 
in the time of blue leaves 

Through the door open wide 
well we put aside our only pride 
and we settle down our hunger 

In the dark you and me 
We could feel but not see 
and we were so young 
and we were in need 
but we just couldn't care 
in the time of blue leaves Baby in that night 
gently by the firelight 
well we settle down to dream 
beyond the walls and beyond the seams 
I see my love in green 

In the dark you and me 
We could fell but not see
and we were so young 
and we were in need 
but we just couldn't care 
in the time of blue leaves 

And we were so young 
and we were in need 
but we just couldn't care 
in the time of blue leaves
