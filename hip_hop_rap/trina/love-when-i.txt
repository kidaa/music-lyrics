I said You and me, we see in circles 
Not so unfamiliar 
We reach we touch 
move together 
unh together 

A love on the inside shinging through 
no need to be spoken that much we can do 
mmmm I just want to feel you 
I said I love when I walk with you 
I want to take your hand 
breathe your every motion 
love when I talk with you well 
You fill me with such deep devotion 

I can see in my mind 
a love so rare, so divine 
when I look at you 
I can hardly hardly believe my eyes A love on the inside shinging through 
no need to be spoken that much we can do 
I just want to feel you 
love when I walk with you 
I want to take your hand 
breathe your every motion 
love when I talk with you well 
You fill me with such deep devotion 

I said love love 
I said love 
I wanna walk the walk 
I wanna talk the talk 
I wanna live with you every day of my life
