A story lies behind your eyes 
And I know 
A story lies behind your pride 
And I know 

These things we hold indefinitely 
Wanting to be free 
The strings we tie remind us 
over and over again 

I wanted to write the world for you 
Give you new eyes to see 
I wanted to right the world for you 
To set you free A history built on a thousand lies 
And I know 
A history fallen from seeded skies 
And I know 

Desperately wanting identity 
Hoping for what could be 
Clinging to reach ahead and see 
While falling all over the past 

I wanted to write the world for you 
Give you new eyes to see 
I wanted to right the world for you 
To set you free
