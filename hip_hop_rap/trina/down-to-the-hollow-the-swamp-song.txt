I wonder when the level runs deep 
Will I go deeper in or pull out of the spin 
Can I go that far? 
My spirit says, ";Yes"; 
but my mind says ";No"; 
There's something so scared 
I've just got to go 
Can I go that far? 

I'm going down to the hollow where the trees meet the soul 
and then I'm trying not to follow another long, lost, lonely road 

Now I see you my mind gets weak 
I don't want to look I fear deceit 
Can I trust you now? 
And now the hands of fate are turning blue 
They've held the cold on back from you 
Well some things don't last that long 
I said some things they go so wrong 

I'm going down to the hollow where the trees meet the soul 
and I'm trying not to follow another lost 
I'm going down to the hollow where the trees meet the soul 
and I'm tyring not to follow another lost, lonely road 

And now I wonder when the level runs deep 
Will I go deeper in or pull out of the spin 
Can I go that far? 
My spirit says ";Yes"; 
but my mind says ";No"; 
There's something so scared 
I I got to go 
Can I go that far? 

I'm going down to the hollow where the trees meet the soul 
and I'm trying not to follow another lost 
I'm going down to the hollow where the trees meet the soul 
and I'm trying not to follow another lost, lonely road
