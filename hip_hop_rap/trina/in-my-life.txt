I see a house
I see a light
I see a little chair set just right
I look around me, I take it all in
Then I start to look again


I try to find you, see you in my life
Try to put you in my chair, see you in my light
Somehow it fades and it dims in my sight
Where am I gonna put you in my life


Not as I planned and not as you see
The things we are, are things we can be
Waivering left, and I'm waivering right
Well I'm losing strength and I don't want to fight
I try to find you, see you in my life
Try to put you in my chair, see you in my light
Somehow it fades and it dims in my sight
Where am I gonna put you in my life


Do I set you on a pillow or hold you in the air
Do I put you on a shelf and dust you with care
Do I hide you in a closet or shut you in a drawer
I really don't know what to do anymore


I try to find you see you in my life
Try to put you in my chair see you in my light
Somehow it fades and it dims in my sight
Where am I gonna put you in my
Where am I gonna put you in my
Where am I gonna put you in my life
