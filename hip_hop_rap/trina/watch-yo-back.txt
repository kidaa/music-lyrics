feat. Twista

[Chorus - Twista]
better watch yo back there boy 
get on yo square or
my gun'll beat your chain 
got the nigga figured out 
showin you off tellin shit aint the same 
go ahead and kick him out cut him up
catch him sleepin fuck him up
only he must not know your name
pimpin is a deadly game 

[repeat Chorus]

[Trina]
oh nigga you mad now actin bad pullin out your gat
its not all you care about its cash so my feelings they asked out
and its so sad how I do fo you 
be da woman come through fo you 
when you do wrong police come through fo you
i even break the truth fo you
but the fact of the matter is
nigga you gon' love who you gon' love
you gon' trust who you gon' trust you gon' fuck
who you gon' fuck
but you wont trust me, no way no how
ya gotta give ya whole life fo a nigga nowadays 
cant be in yo house cant even speak yo mouth
cant even beat him down why the fuck is this so
crazy, derranged that im into your thang 
brings misery and pain
plus they call us lame bitches and heiffers and sluts
think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and battles and cuts
bitch y'all better get tough 
and at the same time y'all better lock the game
and re-rock the game get a glock ready
sit back cock and aim 
and try and stop the pain cuz ya got alot to gain
instead of sittin home waitin on niggas to call
puttin 911 in their beepers and all
we dont deserve this at all y'all

[Chorus - 2X]

[Trina]
nigga how you tame a bitch 
talkin bout your game legit when you aint the shit
then get wit a chick dont maintain a bitch you restrain a bitch
insecure niggas they blame a bitch then reign a bitch
get a ring try to rename a bitch get an attitude
play games with the dick and try to tame a bitch
y'all niggas better critically acclaim a bitch 
you call we come take it like a champ drink all your cum
do a lot of shit ive never done so i keep my cool
cuz i aint the one to start actin up
cuz he even beat us from backin up
i wanna pack my stuff but mama said i cant come back to her
oh lord so I had keep askin ya
for help outta situations killin up my whole life
I'm in love with a thug and he aint treatin my soul right
and i know i dont see him uh dont need him
shit fuck him and feed him
fish stuck him and leave him quick shit...

[Chorus - 2X]

[Trina]
if you're a nigga with no love and dont want no bitch
Dont see no bitch dont need no bitch
then dont tease no bitch shit
cuz we dont need to be
fucked up mentally like a dumb ho
breakin out all your windows
tell the po-po's bout your do-po's oh no
I can get my own shit my own nigga my own dick
I dont need a nigga thinkin that he own a bitch
cuz he bought me shit
7 whole days aint call a bitch shit
nigga shoulda stayed right where he was at
cuz the nigga layed right where he was at
the nigga shoulda died right where he was at
better watch yo back

[Chorus - 3X]
