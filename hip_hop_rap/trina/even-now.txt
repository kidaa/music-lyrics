I said good morning to your face, and a smile I can't erase
It's nice to have you back where I don't know you
The sun shines through your eyes
Sometime even through the lies
We only see what we want to see when were lonley


Oh I can't bring you back to me
and even try to make you see
You know that time runs between us
and leaves us nothing left to hide
Even now I want to hold you
Even now I want to ride the night in your arms
Even now I could still love you


And now the memories never fade
I try to lead my own parade
I wan't to get it back again
But somethings just can't be saved
Now I think of many times
When it could have been so right
Now it seems oh so very wrong
and the parade still marches on


Oh I can't bring you back to me
or even try to make you see
You know that time runs between us
Leaves us nothing left to hide


Even Now I want to hold you
Even now I want to ride the night in your arms
Even now I could still love you
I could still love you
I could still love


Even Now I want to hold you
Even now I want to ride the night in your arms
Even now I could still love you
I could still love you
Even Now
