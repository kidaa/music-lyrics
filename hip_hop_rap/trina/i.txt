Well I live a bearable life 
and I see your eyes looking down at me on the ground 
well I 
I live a safe ridden life 
I've got to push beyond the walls that bound me keep me surround me 
well I 

And you cry move up and out beyond 
I tried I'm left within alone 
I see the things you see in me 
I see the things I want to be 

You are the things that runs through 
You're running through my mind 
You lift me, ground me, 
Keep me, surround me with you 

And I can't stand to see the pain 
I cry, can't hear me through the rain 
What are these things you see in me 
What are these things I want to be 

One to another 
The circle never ends 
One feeds the other 
And drives it on again....I cry 

So true are the things that you do 
What good are words when 
Your actions scream the facts in my 
ears well 

I try, I'm left within alone 
I cry, I'm out here on my own 
What are these things you see in me 
What are these things I want to be
