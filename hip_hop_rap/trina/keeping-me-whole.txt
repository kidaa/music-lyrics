Well I don't know much about some things 
and I don't know much about us 
but when I see your face 
I see your eyes and they're smiling 
well I know that it's you that I love 

You say that I'm the one who'll always find the sunshine in the rain 
So know that I'm the one who'll always keep on coming back again 

Cause when I see your face 
I see your smile and it moves me 
Well It runs way down deep into my soul 
Well It's always with me 
It always keeps me laughing 
I think I found something there that keeps me whole 

Well I don't understand the reasons 
why I do the crazy things that I do 
but the joy you bring me the love it goes right through me 
well there's nothing else I could do 

You say that i'm the one who'll always find the sunshine in the rain 
So know that I'm the one who'll always keep on coming back again 

Cause when I see your face 
I see your smile and it moves me 
Well it runs way down deep into my soul 
Well it's always with me 
It always keeps me laughing 
I think I found something there 

It's like the sun that chases the morning moon from the sky 
some things I never feel I have to question why 
it's like the rise and fall 
the ebb and flow of the tide 
some things I never answer why 

Well I don't know much about some things 
and I don't know much about us 
but when I see your face and 
I see your eyes and they're smiling 
Well I know it's you that I love 

You say that I'm the one who'll always find the sunshine in the rain 
So know that I'm the one who'll always keep on coming back again 

Cause when I see your face 
I see your smile and it moves me 
Well it runs way down deep in my soul 
Your always with me always keeps me laughing 
I think I found something there that keeps me whole
