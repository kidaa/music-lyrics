I know you got that cash man
But you a one minute come to fast man
You fucked worse than my last man, but Ludacris he gon put it on my ass man uh
I called him up, he gee this ass the smack
When he hit it from the back 
I catch a asthma attack
I like the way he take it slow and stroke it
He got me coming back to back 
That boy focused
You used to be my boo but now you fired
Cuz all you do is lick me til ur tongue get tired
I know you hoping you still got me hosing
But when I first seen nelly dick

And you know I can't stand no minute man
