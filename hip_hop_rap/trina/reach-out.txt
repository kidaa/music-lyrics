[Intro:]

I be like why do u call me i never gave u my number first of all 
I find it rude for you to call somebody 
it's like i got ya number from your people,

Hold on 1 sec. baby... hello? 

[Chorus:]
She left you all alone, so take my body home 
i'm here to make ya moan reach out, touch me 
now feel some naked sweat bet it'll drip right down your neck, when i talk ya won't forget reach out, touch me

sit back n close your eyes, don't try to take your time, it's gonna be a night 
reach out, touch me 

[Verse 1:]
I say G's feel ya ass up, me up on a plasma, is there anything better you can ask for? 
ain't nothin sweeter than a diva named trina 
fresh to death like i live at the cleaners

but why do it when i know that i could get some help 
yo take my number, let it marinate, don't even wonder how i turned a winter's night into summer

be prepared to cross our lines that connect-picture that

She left you all alone, so take my body home 
i'm here to make ya moan reach out, touch me

My girls told me bout your line with a 3-way 
But this curious cat don't wanna go off what 'she' say

where i block the haters and a playa get a piece of heaven 
lemme know when you downstairs in mike's kitchen, it's the playgirl's suite

off the hook in a lawn waitin in my birthday suit
