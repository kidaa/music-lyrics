You see not so differently than me 
I see the colors that you see 
I feel the warmth of the same room 
and we draw silly lines so we can't be 
Can't cross the sand internally 
Can't find a place for you and me 

Well together we can bring it round 
brick by brick we'll tear it down 
reaching for the years we've spent 
travelling through our discontent 

And now we see the darkness for the dawn 
pushing through and moving on 
towards a calm we can not see 
and we find the meaning of our fears 
look back on all those wasted tears 
at least there's hope for you an me Well together we can bring it round 
brick by brick we'll tear it down 
reaching for the years we've spent 
travelling through our discontent 

One day in our emptiness 
We may finally see the light 
One day in our loneliness 
We may finally get it right 
We may finally get it right 

Well you breathe not so differently from me 
I see the colors that you see 
Feel the warmth
