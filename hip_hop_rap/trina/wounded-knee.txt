A child with a wounded knee 
Cries out ";Take a look at me"; 
The tears stream her face 
cause she fell right out of the race 
She asks ";Can you fix it for me?"; 
I couldnt save her pride 
She asks ";Can you finish for me?"; 
But I knew it just wouldnt be right 

I told you once, I told you twice 
I didnt really think I gave her bad advice 
But now as I turn around I start to see 
They didnt mean it for me 

I jump back to a time I can hardly see 
There I see a little girl the age of three 
Her daddy standing on the corner giving her a sign 
But he just never really seemed to have the time He said "; I told you once, I told you twice"; 
I didnt really think he gave me bad advice 
But now as I turn around I start to see 
He didnt mean it for me 

A girl sits with her child 
She cant even let out a smile 
The tears stream down her face 
cause she pulled herself out of the race 
She asks ";How can this happen to me?"; 
I couldnt look her in the eye 
She asks ";Can you take her for me?"; 
But I knew it just wouldnt be right 

I said ";I told you once, I told you twice"; 
I didnt really think I gave her bad advice 
But now as I turn around I finally see 
They didnt mean it for me
