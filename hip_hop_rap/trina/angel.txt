Angel came down from heaven yesterday
Stayed here just long enough to rescue me
And he told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue see
Then he spread his wings high over me
He said I'm goin now come back tomorrow


And I said fly on my sweet angel
Oh fly on through the night
Well I said fly on my my sweet angel
Forever I'm gonna be by your side


Sure enough he came unto me
Silver wings sailed away against the giant sunrise
And this angel well he said unto me
Today is the day for you to rise so
so take my hand, your gonna be mine, and your gonna rise
Then he took me high over yonder


And I said fly on my my sweet angel
Oh fly on through the night
Well I said fly on my my sweet angel
Don't you know forever I'm gonna be by your side
I said fly onmy sweet angel
forever I'm gonna be by your side
Fly on my sweet angel I'm gonna be by your side
Fly on my baby fly
Fly on my angel fly by
