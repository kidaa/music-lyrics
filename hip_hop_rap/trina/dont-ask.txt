I told you once, I think I did 
I told you once that I love you more than anything 
I see you now, look in your eyes 
They look through me, they look on to another side 

How can you see these things and not be there, truly be there 
How can I even ask you why 
Thoughts run, mind flies as I ask you 
Can you be there 
You say ";Oh."; 

You told me once, I think you did 
You said youd hold me once, once I knew more than I ever could 
Til that day, til that hour 
I wait, lord I pray, while holding on to anothers arm 

How can you say these things and not be there, truly be there 
How can you even ask me why 
Thoughts run, mind flies as you ask me 
Can I be there 
I say ";Oh"; 

I told you once, I know I did 
I told you once that all we need is honesty 
Look to me, look in my eyes 
Look for me and Ill be there by your side 

How can I say these things and not be there, truly be there 
How can I even ask you why 
Thoughts run, mind flies and I ask me 
Will I be there 
I say ";oh.stop asking"; 
";Stop asking why";
