[Intro]
Unusual suspect unusual suspect 
But I know these niggas but I know these niggas.
Jim Johnson, Big D Jim Johnson & Big D.
Ah dis Trina & Plies Slip & Slide thang, I'm in here wit the Baddest Bitch.
Ah Trina take care these hoes, cuz I got these niggas. 

[Chorus]
[Trina]
My steering wheel wood, & my wheels croma.
Can't pay these niggas to leave me alone.
I'm so fresh, I'm so fresh. 

[Plies]
I gotta pocket full of money and my teeth glitter.
Sum bout been a trille ass nigga.
I'm so fresh.
I'm so fresh. 

[Trina]
Paint candy racin' sribs.
Crush dem bitches off the rip.
I don't think you really wanna mess with me, test me and eventually.
See me speedin', cops don't see em', fuck em' & feed em' wouldn't wanna be em'.
I ain't scared of ya'll,
I ain't no regular broad I'ain't scared at all.
Like bone crusher I'll crush your bones when I come through strong with my big big brone.
Ride spinners like 3-6 do. Let me do me nigga you do you.
Suck this clit till my shit turn blue.
Put a bitch to sleep wake me up when you threw.
I'ma get dress so fresh lookin' new and it's back to the chevy or the cab for you.
Chuck & Duece switchin' lanes.
Ridin' dat douk & sittin' on things.
You ain't never met a bitch like me and your bitch ain't never ride a dick like me.
Check the paint, watch the feet, inches 26's deep, candy drippin' on the street, bitch I'm ridin;
BIG. 

[Chorus]

[Plies]
Ain't too many niggas like me. I'm from a rare breed.
I walk it like I talk.
Was raise by a G.
You ain't suppose to like me dog, cuz I'm what you wanna be.
From top to bottom being trille that's something that's in me.
It's a helluva feelin to know that you 100% a real nigga.
I been out here gettin' money, since I was a lil nigga.
I'm loved by these hoes, respected by these killers,
it took years of thuggin' to get to this point nigga.
I don't know if you know how it feels to walk around with stacks.
I been broke, came up and I ain't going back.
Cuz money get you friends, choppers get you respect.
Respect out here in these streets, I got alot of that. 

[Chorus]
