I hold a thought in my head 
Don't want to let it go 
cause I don't know where it might land 
and now I've got to find the strength to set it free 
cause if I don't lord it's gonna get the best of me 

Then I see at the count of three 
you've already taken the thought from me 
You let it go in hopes to show 
there's a chance for it to grow 
and now I find some piece of mind 
but then I'm always left behind 
and I hold my hands to the sky 
lord I pray and wonder why 

and now I hold a thought in my hand 
I let it go cause I thought you might understand 
and now I see the way you look at me 
well I guess the thought would have been better left with me 

and then I see at the count of three 
You're already running away from me 
You let it go in hopes to show 
there's a chance for it to grow 
and now I find some piece of mind 
but then I'm always left behind 
and I hold my hands to the sky 
lord I pray and wonder why 

now I hold a thought in my hand 
I let it go gotta let it crawl and understand 
and now I see this space inside of me 
and it's welling up with another thought to be free 

and I see at the count of three 
it's already taken the shape in me 
I let it go gonna let it grow 
I've got to let you know 
and now I find some piece of mind 
Now the truth is oh so kind 
and I hold my hands to the sky 
lord I pray and wonder why 
lord I pray and wonder why 
lord I pray and wonder why 
lord I pray and wonder why
