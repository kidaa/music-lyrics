Escobar season has returned...

Its been a long time
been a long time comin'
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now.
This is what makes me.
This is what I am.



Chorus: 

You can hate me now QB
But I won't stop now Real Niggas
Cause I can't stop now Bravehearts
You can hate me now C'mon
But I won't stop now	
Cause I can't stop now	
You can hate me now	
You can hate me nooow	

Do it now, Do It now,	
do it now		

Verse 1:

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin,
sixes, money foldin
Bitches honeys that swollen
the riches, nas get in ya
most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ring side try watchin my paper
almost a decade quite impressive
most of the best is in the essence
for this rap shit that I stand for
expanding more to the big screen
bill gates dreams
but it seems youd rather see me in jail
with state dreams
want me off the scene fast
but good things last
like your favorite m.c. still makin' some mean cash
first rapper to bring a platinum plaque 
back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest
I suggest




Do it now
Chorus 	






Do it now, I told you do it now	

Verse 2:

You wanna hate me then hate me
what can I do?
but keep gettin money
funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up
until I made it
now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga
nothing to play with
hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
sayin' we left the hood
but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes
give 'em to you?
here's my car and my house
you can live in that too
criticize when I flow for the streets
hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that
what you expect hoe
nickname esco
took this game to its threshold
best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
try to make it like you the realest
but who the illest?
think we all know the answer to that
cause niggas feel this right




Do it now

Chorus



Verse 3:

Its a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates
I was destined to come
predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
took a little time to claim my spot
chairman of the board until this game stop
and I side with the Lord
ride for the cause 
while driving, niggas shot out my doors
plottin, I'm sure to catch me
with they glocks to my jaw
try stickin my up but I 
but I flipped on these ducks	
Instead of me
ambulances were picking them up	
niggas fear what they don't understand
hate what they can't conquer
guess its just a theory of man
became a monster, atop of the world
never fallin
I'm as real as they come
from day one, forever ballin
c'mon




Chorus x2
Do it now, do it now
do it now, do it now
c'mon
Hate me now, hate me now
C'mon niggas, c'mon niggas
do it now, get the shit over with
it ain't gonna ever stop niggas
