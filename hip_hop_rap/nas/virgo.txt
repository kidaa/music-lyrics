OnetwoyeahhuhNasir

[Chorus - Nas]
Baby girl wont you come and hold my hand 
Wont you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand 
Wont you come and just chill with the Virgo 
We sippin on Merlot
You aint got be my girl though 
Ill drop you off at Woolabee and Merdo
Smash with the Virgo
Aint got to take your shirt off  
But see me convince your homegirl though 

[Nas]
Uh, she says some life is too hard
She says that she wanna come build and with the god 
Promise me that she gonna play her part 
Cuz what I spit gets straight to her heart 
And she damn fine, feet hammertime 
Damn if I mind 
Long as the butt bubble in back of your waistline
I dont waste time, I gotta get-get on it 
Just you and me, two glasses.
In the club scene where I met Miss Green Eyes 
She walked by asking me Are you Nas?
Why? 
If you was Id be totally T.W.I
Whats that?
Totally With It. T.W.I 
Ha, well here I am
Yep, Im the man
Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand
So here we standin before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem 
Tongue skills, yea I like that
Now we on the right track 
Straight to my Phantom called Africa Black
Ever since then, she been yappin her track
Told her friends now they hollerin behind her back 
Sing

[Chorus - Nas]
Baby girl wont you come and hold my hand 
Wont you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand 
Wont you come and just chill with the Virgo 
We sippin on Merlot
You aint got be my girl though 
Ill drop you off at Woolabee and Merdo
Smash with the Virgo
Aint got to take your shirt off  
But see me convince your homegirl though

[Ludacris]
Now I was so fresh and so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin, bling!
A little cute thing said, Whats your name?
I put my necklace in her face and told her Read the chain
Ooh, ooh so stuck up
Told me Shut the fuck up
Blow! Ludacris is in the hot Luke house
The needle hit the record, they was playin this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh on
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance 
While Im laid back chillin in my b-boy stance 
Could be a little pop lockin if your girls tops droppin 
But watch for cock blockin all my coochie stock options 
But later for that ASDAQ throw em on the fast track 
Make em swip-swap Nasty N.A.S pass that 
Honey in the black cuz Im feelin her curves 
She looked down and what I had is that wa-wa word 
Why only serve one when you can serve up two
Then at the bachelors pad doin what the Virgos do 
And these women so shy, but get loud undercover
So we can have sex, but I cant be your lover! 
Sing

[Chorus - Ludacris]
Baby girl wont you come and hold my hand 
Wont you come and just chill with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand 
Wont you come and chill out with the Virgo 
We sippin on Merlot
You aint got be my girl though 
Ill drop you off at Peachtree and Merlot
Smash with the Virgo
Aint got to take your shirt off  
But see me convince your homegirl though
