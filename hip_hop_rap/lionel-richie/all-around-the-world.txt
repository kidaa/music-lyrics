All around the world 
Let's go all around the world 
All around the world 
Take me all around the world 
Give me joy, give me love 
Take it all around the world 

So much love, love is real 
So much life, life is what you feel 
It's in your mind, it's in your heart and soul 
The time is right , you've just got to know 
It's time to let go 

All around the world 
Let's go all around the world 
All around the world 
Take me all around the world 
Give me joy, give me love 
Take it all around the world 
I said all around the world 
Let's go all around the world 

Make a wish, dreams come true 
Follow your heart, it is only for you 
It's crazy, it's a crazy world 
Come to the music, come lose your mind 
Follow thw rhythm, don't get left behind
