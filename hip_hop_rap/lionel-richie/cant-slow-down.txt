I know what's on your mind  
You feel you're wasting time  
Wanna talk about it?  
You feel there's something wrong  
Don't feel like holding on  
You better think about it  
You say you just can't see  
Don't lay that hurt on me  
What I'm trying baby  
Got something on my mind  
Something I've got to find  
I'm on the move baby  

Chorus 
You see I can't slow down  
Got to keep movin' baby can't slow down  
No I can't slow down  
Oh can't slow down  
Got to keep movin' on, oh baby  

I'm out here on the run  
Trying to get things done  
Can you hear me baby?  
You think my love's nowhere  
You think I just don't care  
Are you kidding baby?  
Don't make me play no games  
To hard to just stay sane  
You know that time won't wait  
Why should I hesitate  
Got to do it baby  

Chorus 
You see I can't slow down  
I got to keep movin' baby can't slow down  
No I can't slow down  
Can't stop baby, No can't slow down  
Got to keep pushin'  
Got to keep movin' on  
Oh, oh baby, Ah, Oh, Oh baby, Ugh  

Bridge 
I'm working hard tryin' to pull it together  
You know I've got to right now  
'Cause girl I can't quit once I get started,  
I've got to make it somehow ...  

Ah, I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin'  
I got to keep movin', I can't stop  
I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin'  
I got to keep movin', I can't stop  
Oh, I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin'  
I got to keep movin', I can't stop  
That's right I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin'  
That's right I got to keep movin', I can't stop  
That's right  

Can't slow down  
Can't slow down  
Can't slow down  
Oh, can't slow down  
Can't slow down  
Can't slow down  
Baby 
Oh girl I'm all fired up  
Oh girl I'm all fired up  
Just can't get enough, girl of it, Ah  
Girl I'm on the one, 'cause I keep on keepin' on  
Oh yeah, Oh  
You see I can't slow down  
Got to keep movin' baby can't slow down  
No, No I can't slow down  
Got to keep movin' baby, Oh can't slow down  
Ooh, just can't slow down  
Can't slow down  
Can't stop baby can't slow down  
Ooh, alright can't slow down  
Ah running, can't slow down  
Running running baby can't slow down  
Ooh, can't slow down  
Got to keep movin' can't slow down  
Ooh yeah girl can't slow down
