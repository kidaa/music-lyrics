Hey, I can see that smile on your face
Tonight
Memories will never erase
And I feel like our time has come
Our hearts are beating wild as one
True love I know is hard to find
But you tonight you're mine

Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight

Hey, I hope you feel the same way I feel
Cause tonight
The moon, the stars, this moment so real
To once
We have every thing
Our hearts have a song to sing
We now know that dream's come true
Cause now there's me and you

Didn't we have the time of our life tonight I'm saying
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight I'm saying
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight

Didn't we dance the night away
What can I say to you
You make life a holiday
Let's go and play
Let's go and play

Didn't we have the time of our life tonight I'm saying
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight I'm saying
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight

Come on and sing the song
Come on and sing along
