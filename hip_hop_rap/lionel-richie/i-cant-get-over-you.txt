I guess I need to say I'm sorry,  
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself,  
Over you.  
I only wanted just to love you,  
But now that we're through,  
I can't get over you.  
I didn't mean to write a love song,  
I didn't mean to share these feelings,  
I have, in my heart.  
I told myself I could forget you,  
Now that I know that's not true,  
I can't get over you.  
As I walk down the halls,  
I see your pictures hanging on the walls,  
Those memories;  
For all the things we've been through,  
My heart can still feel me and you,  
Sweet memories;  
After the pain, 
Of losing you;  
After the heartache,  
I know it's true.  
'Cause when I saw you,  
I still can say,  
I am never gonna love anybody else,  
The way I love you,  
Today. 
I guess I need to say I'm sorry,  
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself,  
Over you.  
I only wanted just to love you,  
But now that we through,  
I can't get over you,  
I can't get over you.  
I can't get,  
Over you.  
No, no more heart is breaking, baby.  
I can't get, I can't get  
Over you;  
Can't get you out of my mind.  
I try so hard to love you,  
I can't get over you.  
Now you gonna be gone,  
From me  
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get over you;  
You've got my heart in your hand,  
I can't get over you,  
You and me, baby,  
Had a thing going on.
