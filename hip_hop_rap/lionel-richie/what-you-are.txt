It's four in the morning and I'm sitting here at night 
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind 
I'm leaving in an hour and you won't be up in time to say goodbye so whoa 
I'm putting this on tape baby you're wonderful 
I really mean it babe more than you will ever know 
I wish that I could stay but I gotta go 
I'll be back in the meantime 
Keep in mind that 

You are 
Is something to big for words 
And it's my pleasure to love you for better or worse 
Cause what you are 
A beautiful mother to your kids 
Sometimes it slips my mind so in case I forget 
Girl you are better than anything 
I ever had 
You are the perfect love 
Never give you up 
Because you are my heart and soul my breath 
Take it all till nothings left 
Cause baby you are 

Now no man has ever loved his woman 
LIke I love you girl you know it's true 
And no man can ever say he does a woman better than I do you 
Cause that ain't true here's what I do 
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week 
Take you shopping whenever 
But more importantly 
Wrap my loving arms around you 
To reassure everything I felt that first night 
I feel it more
