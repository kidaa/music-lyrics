Ballerina girl you are so lonely 
With you standing there 
I'm so aware 
Of how much I care for you 
You are more than now 
You are for always 
I can see in you my dreams come true 
Don't you ever go away 

You make me feel like 
There's nothing I can't do 
And when I hold you 
I only want to say I love you 
Ballerina girl the joy you bring me 
Every day and night 
Holding you tight 
How I've waited for your love 

Sometimes I've wondered 
If you'd ever come my way 
Now that I've finally found you 
This is where my heart will stay woah 

Never gonna break your heart 
Never will we drift apart
