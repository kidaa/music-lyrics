I Look At You 
You Look At Me 
You Can't Help It You're Feeling Butterflies 
Its obvious, 
We have Chemistry 
I think I know it cuz it feels so right 
Girl I wanted so long to know 
Now Your telling me you gotta let it go 
Dont Tell Me I have to start all over again 
I Never thought that this day would come 
This is somthing that i've wanted in my life 
I relize that you're the one 
and you're telling me its time to say goodbye 
To Put this out of my heart It ain't gonna change 
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away 
You feel it I feel it lets not be tense 

[Chorus]
Baby, I Don't Know What Love Is 
Maybe I'm A Fool 
I Just Know What I'm Feeling 
And It's All Because Of You 
Don't Tell Me 
I Don't Know 
I Want The Truth 
Cuz They Call It 
We Call It 
You Call It 
I Call It Love 

It's so clear for you to see 
dont let anybody tell you what to do 
Why they can't they just let us be happy 
i dont want to find somebody new 
If you know whats real in your heart 
Then dont let them tear us apart 
Cuz you feel it I feel it Lets think this through 

[Chorus]
Baby, I Don't Know What Love Is 
Maybe I'm A Fool 
I Just Know What I'm Feeling 
And It's All Because Of You 
Don't Tell Me 
I Don't Know 
I Want The Truth 
Cuz They Call It 
We Call It 
You Call It 
I Call It Love 

[Break]
We Have a bond thats unbreakable 
And its not time to let it go 
And now that we know its real 
We are going to let it show 
To the whole world 
That I'm yours forever 
and you're my girl 

[Chorus]
Baby, I Don't Know What Love Is 
Maybe I'm A Fool 
I Just Know What I'm Feeling 
And It's All Because Of You 
Don't Tell Me 
I Don't Know 
I Want The Truth 
Cuz They Call It 
We Call It 
You Call It 
I Call It Love 
[Repeat 2]

They Call It Love 
I Call it
