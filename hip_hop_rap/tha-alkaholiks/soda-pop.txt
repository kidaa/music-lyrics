Verse One: E-Swift

Hoes on my nuts just because of my position
Can't fade the bitches that's always bitchin
Love to kick beats, rock rhymes on occasion
Down with the niggaz that the hoes keep pagin
Gimme gimme gimme my gin and super-sak
Then, let me hit the doobie, can't fuck with the rock
Bust one shot if you're with me with me
Niggaz swing back don't hit me hit me
I can freak freak the funk the funk funk
And hit skins all night if I wanna when I'm drunk
Can't fade the pop pop pop goes the nina
Tha Liks be rockin shows from New York to Pasadena
When it comes to rhymes -- god damn I can rock em
When it comes to boots -- god damn I can knock em
Got mad flavor so do me a favor
and bump that shit it's the motherfuckin Liks!

Verse Two: Field Trip

Aiyyo, I cut like a ginsu, I been through, hell
and back, stabbers get swell
Tossed from my balls
Bitches lick the crush off my balls
Pause, yo
I'm lickin off walls
to scatter, nigga this is theory
and my shit is kinda fatter
Stagger, cause I got shanked by a dagger
Yo you can't fuck with the Wild Wild West
I'm a shady ass nigga and I slit you like stress
They say ballers only sport Guess
But that's a motherfuckin lie cuz I got a pair of Levi's
Niggaz rollin thick like a New York steak
Field Trip on the beach now got your momma on some pancakes
I know you sayin damn that little nigga's dope
I got a loaded tec nine under my motherfuckin coat
Niggaz wanna jack the back, never nope
I stick my gat down your throat, and tell your ass no

Verse Three: Tash

The forty's kickin in I gotta drain my main vein
Got drinks in my freezer bust styles I can't explain
And the name of my group ain't changin cuz it fit us
Hit us, one time, for my cats that ain't with us
On the down low drinkin whiskey in the basement
If a sample won't clear I substitue with a replacement
One two ya don't stop when it hits two o'clock
 You can't buy the alcohol so you drink soda pop
 Like that and uhh, it's like that
 Sometimes it's like that

[King Tee] Yeah, yeah, yeah, ay
           How y'all like that one right there
           Y'all like that one
           Yeah, that's my boys
