[Tash] Yes to party down
[J-Ro] We came to party, we came to party, we came to party

Verse One: Tash

Aiyyo, step in my area, and I'ma bury ya
Tha Likwit crew is blowin so the more the girl the merrier
So bring your sexy body to the front and make some noise
while these beats wind the Likwit homies up like Freakazoids
Plus my style as hot as sex on a platta
That's why your dame was open once I threw these lyrics at her
Say what  The rhyme data 
Smokin wack MC's so bad I'm at the ground evacuatin
So hit the exits, while I'm rhyme flexin on some next ish
That come across in different shapes and forms like playin Tetris
So from the West it's who I thought you knew
Cool ass CaTashTrophe, from the crew with all the moves
so pop the tops off, while I pop beats that knock your blocks off
TASH, got the style that house any beanie bopper
So check the time of clock while I rock the land
 quot;Hey ladies! quot; tell em whose in this jam

Chorus: repeat 2X

It's Tha Liks baby 
[J-Ro] Here to wet your top
[Tash] So all the ladies gather round, it's time to party down
[J-Ro] That's right That's right that's right
#1 repeat [J-Ro] We got the Henn Rock flowin all night
#2 repeat [J-Ro] We gotta keep the party blowin all night
#3 repeat [J-Ro] Tha Likwit up in ya all night
#4 repeat [J-Ro] DJ spin the record all night
#5 repeat [J-Ro] We'll have sex on the beach all night
#6 repeat [J-Ro] It's Tha Liks baby baby all night

Verse Two: J-Ro

Yo, it goes down like one two three
It's Tha Alkaholiks in the place to be
Whether you from France, Japan or Italy
An R amp;B fan, or a dope MC
Some ol' jazz cat that won a Grammy
A wide receiver, from Miami
A soccer goalie or a maitre'd
A Playboy Bunny, even if you can't see
I don't give a damn if you security
or you got a degree, at USC
My uncle, my cousin, or my auntie
You could be one-time it don't matter to me
Cause when you bring your ass to a Likwit show
You gonna get wet if you in the front row
*E-Swift scratches* Row... row... Ro... Ro..
... now on with the show

Chorus

Verse Three: J-Ro, Tash

One two, one two
I got a tape in my ride, made by Homicide
Ralph M and DJ Pen make the wheels spin
Let's make some noise for the Baka Boyz
DJ Dee and Hen Gee in the place to be
Joe Cooley and Mark and Evil E
Master C, Sam Jam, and 
Assada got bam slam with DJ Jam
Let loose the 4th Alkaholik puts the wheels to use uhh
D-Pimp, Mad Lib, my nigga Juice
And DJ Pooh, I like the beats you produce
You know how we do, with DJ Kiilu
Makin girls shake they asses, Inf's got all the passes
I'm playin John Madden, with DJ Alladin
Had my girl under the cover, went with Egyptian Lover
I'm on the radio, microphone mic-a-don
All my yapes I would pay for a mix tape I'd trade
DJ Mark Love makes the party push and shove
I float over a beat made by Chris the Glove
The Beat Junkies, Nu-Mark and Cut Chemist
My homey  leave ya mouth open like a dentist
Bobcat, DJ Smooth and Battlecat
The Sway and King Tech Wake Up Show is fat
General Lee gets busy but remember this
Scotty D, Keith Coolie, and Cold Krush Chris
