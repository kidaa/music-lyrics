Niggaz, bitches - back again to get it crackin
Smoked a blunt, drunk a brew, turned around and look what happened
Whatcha workin with Official party clique
Weed smokin drunk, O.D.B./Bob Marley shit
We got that shit so ladies come and get it
Custom-fitted flows for all the hoes that's fuckin with it

You know how we act once we buzzed off that Cognac

You must be off that rum I was born to bust
Some say I cuss too much, but I don't give a fuck

[Shae Fiol] Where's it comin from
[J-Ro] It's comin from the soul
Hip-Hop and rock'n'roll, we bout to lose control

[Chorus: Tha Liks]
We run wild, RUN WILD, run wild, RUN WILD
{*E-Swift scratches:  quot;run.. run.. run.. run wild quot;*}

CaTash be runnin wild like ARRAGH - who let the dogs out
Run wild break yo'self through the maze
We rockin ninety-thousand underground at the raves
Say what Dialogue is strange, I wrote this in the rain
I do what I do then I pop that champagne
