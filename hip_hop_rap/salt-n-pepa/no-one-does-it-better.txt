Baby...
Baby, baby, baby give it to me
Oh, yeah I need it
Come and get it I'm ready
Cuz no one does it better than me than you, you, you
Than me, yeah yeah oh, sugar

No one does it better than me
No one does it girl, no one

Yo, Mr. Don Juan, give me everything I need
I'm ready for the world, rub me down, proceed
Treat like the mic then rock me
Let's do it while you hold me in the air - don't drop me
Heavyweight boot-knocker, whatcha wanna do
In the waterbed room, yeah, just me and you
I got the fever for the nook-nook
So if ya never seen a body like this take a good look
Take a good look, bet that ass'll be hooked
Because I'm better than a good book
She can't match the cat, and when she looks at your back
She sees Salt in a passion scratch
We go round and round so let me break it down
If she was all that, you wouldn't be here right now

Cuz you know I know, you know that
No one does it better bet no one does it like you do
No one does it better no one does it, better than I do yeah yeah
No one does it better no light whether they're cute too oh no
No one does it yeah, oh baby, no one

Well that's true, that's why you never have no beef
Cuz when the bugle is blown it's all tongue and no teeth
You're gettin' done between the sheets
And I know you don't cheat cuz at home you gets freaked
And worked out to capacity
A good piece of ass to me, that's all you have to be
I lay ya down to the maximum
And I'm extra in the middle cuz that's where I'm waxin' him
Honey knows where the flavor's at
Who's cat is all that, who keeps comin' back...

To me, can't stay away
Gotta have it night and day just because
No one does it better no one does it, better than I do no one
No one does it better nobody does it like you do
No one does it better no one does it to me, better than I do
No one does it yeah, oh, oh baby, no one

You're damn right no one does it better than me
Pepa's got ways to keep ya happy
Don't put nothin' past me
If I wanna I do, if I don't then don't ask me
Aim to please the man and freak the man
Twenty-four seven cuz he's the man
Got thrills and frills like a theme park
Before the chill part, you can't have an ill heart
Cuz it's definitely on when I hit the bedroom
That knows zooma-zoom-zoom in his poom-poom
Pep's the body mechanic so don't panic
I'll let ya have it, but love ain't always automatic
I never had a complaint, never said I feel faint
I got the face of a saint, you think I am but I ain't

Cuz you know I know, you know that
No one does it better not better than you do
No one does it better no one does it, better than I do
no one does it
No one does it better nobody does it like you do
No one does it yeah, oh, oh baby, no one

No one does it better no one, better than I do
No one does it better is better than you, better than I do
No one does it better no one else, nobody is better than you
better than I do
No one does it, oh baby, no one
No one does it better...
