[Verse 1]

Homegirls, attention you must pay
So listen close to what I say
Don't take this as a simple rhyme
Cos this type of thing happens all of the time
Now, what would you do if a stranger said "Hi..."
Would you diss him, or would you reply
If you answer there is a chance
That you'll become a victim of circumstance
Am I right fellas Tell the truth
Or else Imma have to show and prove
You are what you are, I am what I am
It just so happens that most men are tramps

[Verse 2]

Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood
I know a guy like that, girl
He thinks he's god's gift to the world
You know that kind, excited all the time
With nothin' but sex on the mind
I'm no stunt, on me you can't front
I know the real deal, I know what they want
It's me why because I'm so sexy
It's me what don't touch my body boy
Cos ya see, I ain't no skeezer
But on a real tip, I think he's a...tramp

[Verse 3]

On the first date he thought I was a dummy
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me
But of course I knew it was a lie, y'all
He undressed me with his eyeballs
Trying to change the whole subject
Cos everything he said pertained to sex
So I dissed him, I said you's a sucker
Get your dirty mind out the gutter
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots
You ain't treatin' me like no prostitute
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser
You're on a mission, kid, yo he's a...tramp
