I couldn't believe what I was seeing
Faces all screwed up like what I'd done
I didn't mean to hurt you so much
I knew it would hurt you but not like this
We all make a mess from time to time, dear
But it'll take me a lifetime to get this cleared
Somebody muttered something under their breath
But I let on like I was a little deaf
Nobody's perfect, that's what I say
No one has hurt me so much you say
I'm sorry
Running away seemed like the easy thing to do because I wanted time
To put a smile back on your face
For once nothing's missing and I feel fine
I was afraid to tell you some things
But some things all find a way to get told
Hearing it from the lips of somebody else
Must have knocked the wind out of your sweet chest
