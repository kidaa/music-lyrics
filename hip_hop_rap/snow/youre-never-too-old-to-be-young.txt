This song was not included in the theatrical release of Snow White. It was replaced by
the above Silly Song as the piece to entertain the princess. You will find the recording
on the Special Edition Laser Disc. It was never animated. 

Yodel: 

Yodel-ay-ee-hoo etc. 

Repeat 

Chorus
You're never too old to be young
You're never too old to be young 

When you start to lose your figure
And your hips are gettin' bigger
Your chest may slip
But don't you fret
No matter how weak your knees may get 

Chorus 

Though your teeth are out 
And your whiskers sprout
And your arches give away
You're never too old to be young and gay 

Yodel 

When ya ain't got any fuzz upon your dome
When ya ain't got any fuzz upon your dome 
Why the dickens should you care
If you ain't got any hair
'Cuz you never have to use a brush and comb 

When you know your legs are gonna give out soon
When you know your legs are gonna give out soon
When your joints begin to squeak
If you practice for a week
You can walk around and play yourself a tune
Your voice may crack when you try to sing 

But you can't be good at everything 

Yodel, etc. 

Chorus
