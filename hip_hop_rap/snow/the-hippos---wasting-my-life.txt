the lyrics

something in the way she never looks my way I'm in love
something in the way she doesn't hear a word I say I'm in love
but people say we're not the same
she's out of my league I'm insane
am I wasting my life waiting for you, is it true
am I wasting my life on you 
so tell me it's not true
something in the way she looked at me today I'm in love
something in the way she says for me to get away I'm in love
but people say we're not the same
she's out of my league I'm insane
am I wasting my life waiting for you, is it true
am I wasting my life on you
so tell me it's not true
