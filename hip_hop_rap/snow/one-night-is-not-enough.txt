You left your door wide open
Couldn't help but walk in
It's the last place I should be
But I'm dying to see you
Have I held out for something
That is never going to happen?
It's not me that you love
You woke up cold this morning
Shied away from my touch
I would never mean to hurt you
Cause I love you so much
Was it always only one night
That you every wanted from me?
It's not me that you love
