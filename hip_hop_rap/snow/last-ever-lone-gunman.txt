This heart break is never ending
It's like it never happened
A fall from grace is close
Why not speed it up?
I've never been so angry
To find out that I failed
It didn't even work
I have to make amends
I shot him from the window
The world just held it's breath
And I made my escape
As if no-one could see
I took off in my pick-up
Kids screaming in the back seat
They heard the shots too
And screamed cause that's their way
I do it alright in my own way
We've all got bigger plans
But when it comes down to it
Mine might save the world
At least for one more day
Don't judge me from your sofas
On TV things don't ever come across so true
They're made up in your minds
