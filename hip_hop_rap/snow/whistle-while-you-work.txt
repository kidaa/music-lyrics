Just whistle while you work
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune
It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace 

And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom is someone that you love
And soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune 

Spoken: Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub
When hearts are high the time will fly so whistle while you work 

*Another version*
Just whistle while you work
Put on that grin and start right in to whistle loud and long
Just hum a merry tune
Just do your best and take a rest and sing yourself a song 

When there's too much to do
Don't let it bother you, forget your troubles,
Try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee 

And whistle while you work
Come on get smart, tune up and start
To whistle while you work
