To run about with no style chasing her around Dundee
Making sense about as much as nonsense is meant to make sense
Sleeping in cause I'm mortified to go outside today
All this time and I have chnaged so much but sometimes never
Keep in time
All my love I am leaving here because I cannot cope with your man touching you and patronising me
What's his game?
I don't give a toss about what he has to say for himself or anyone for that matter
Keep in time
All this time I'm thinking if I could make you love me
I'd be better this time, swear to God
