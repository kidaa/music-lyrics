I wish I had a penny for
everytime she gave me those eyes
Those eyes would cry, take me on the floor
I've been with her once of twice
In my dreams it felt so nice
I'd do exactly what tose eyes told me
There's never a smile on your face
Always a gesture of disgrace
Obviously you're unhappy with my stares that I hold far too long
Of course I know that it is wrong
But deep down inside I know you like it
In my little hide
Upon the rack I'm stretched and split
Demeted as I do my bit
Whatever I could do to make you smile
I can't wait to get to bed
Not so I can rest my head
It means I can dream about you more
