Step up to the tub
It ain't no disgrace
Just pull up your sleeves
And get up in place
Then scoop up the water
And rub it on your face
An' go blud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle
Ud-dle-um-dum 

Pick up the soap
Now don't try to to bluff
Work up a lather 
An' when ya got enough
Get your hands full of water
Ya snort an ya snuff
An' go blud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle
Ud-dle-um-dum 

Ya douse an souse
Ya rub and scrub
Ya sputter and splash all over the tub
You may be cold and wet when your done
But ya gotta admit it's goot clean fun 

So splash all ya like 
It ain't any trick
As soon as your through
You'll feel mighty slick
Bunch of old nanny goats
Ya make me sick, goin'
An' go blud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle
Ud-dle-um-dum 

Now scrub good an' hard
It can't be denied
That he'll look mighty cute
As soon as he's dried
Well it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide
To go blud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle
Ud-dle-um-dum
