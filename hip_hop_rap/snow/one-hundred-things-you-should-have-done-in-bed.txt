I haven't left here yet, but I'm trying
I'm still tied to the bed
Can you come here?
When you come, would you please bring a knife
And cure me down
Cause this is larger than life and I'm frightened
100 things you should have done in bed
But you never had the chance to try them
At least the dog has a smile on its face
I'm drained and I'm dry and I'm sore
It's not that bad if she could be here all the time
It would kill me
I think I've been broken in tow and I can't scream
