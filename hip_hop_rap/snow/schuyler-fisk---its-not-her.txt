the lyrics

When I see your heart lying open,
I don't close it back up,
But I jump on in.
I take advantage of the situation.
Oh, I . . I,
I'm in love with you.

I know your birthday,
And I know your name.
I know your password,
And your favorite thing.
And I know what you're thinking, boy,
Almost all the time.
I know what you're missing, yeah,
And who you should be kissing.
And it's not her.
And it's not her.

Sometimes, I think, if you opened your eyes and looked,
You would find me, right here.
And when I see your heart lying open,
I don't close it back up,
But I jump on in.
I take advantage of the situation.

Oh, I . . . I,

I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love, I'm in love . .
