I could help myself to something
Like a little bit of revelation
You could be the one to help me help myself
Maybe if I could see exactly what was in your way I'd move it for you
Don't always need to do it by yourself
UI'm not trying to find a way to get into your bed
I'll just sing for you
Until you fall asleep, then I will go
I never understood how you should feel
You've been left out
I'd never do that
It's all in your imagination, dear
