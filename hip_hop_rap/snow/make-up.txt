If I could understand this better
I might be a little closer to you
Brushing my face with her hair
As she pushes past towards the door
That's a little ticklish but please just don't stop
She's probably heard this a million times before
The sweep of her brush is like a gentle lick
It seems to make her like everything you want
Cause if you didn't you'd want her soon enough
That's a little ticklish but please just don't stop
