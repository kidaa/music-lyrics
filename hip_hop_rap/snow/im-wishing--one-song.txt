One Song
I have but one song 
One song 
Only for you 

One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true 

One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through 

One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you

===

I'm wishing I'm wishing
For the one I love
To find me to find me
Today today
I'm hoping I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of 
The nice things the nice things 
He'll say 

Repeat
