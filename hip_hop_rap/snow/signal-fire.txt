The perfect words never crossed my mind, 
Cuz there was nothin' in there but you.
I felt every ounce of me screaming out, 
But the sound was trapped deep in me.
All I wanted just sped right past me, 
While I was rooted fast to the earth, 
I could be stuck here for a thousand years, 
Without your arms to drag me out. 

[Chorus:]
There you are standing right in front of me
There you are standing right in front of me
All this fear falls away to leave me naked, 
Hold me close, cuz I need you to guide me to safety.

No, I don't want to wait forever [x2]

In the confusion and the aftermath, 
You are my signal fire.
The only resolution and the only joy,
Is the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyes. 

[Chorus x2]

No, I don't want to wait forever [x3]
