I'm good for inspiration, aren't I?
You will find
Well, close the door and I'll go anywhere
You take me to from this bed onto so much more
Care for you, I will
Can I have a picture of you tonight
Keep it with me always in my mind
Tough me cause I can't move
I can barely breathe,
speechless, breathless
I can't tell you if I'm here or not
Running both legs tied together
Arms in the air
Care for you, I will
Can I have a picture of you tonight
Keep it with me always in my mind
