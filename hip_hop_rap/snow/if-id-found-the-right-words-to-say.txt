Right about now, if I'd found the right words to say
I'd tell you you're safe and take hold of your hand
I'll be there by your side for the rest of your life
Our bodies could fall off the end of the world
Something told me we'd be happy forever
I don't see how this could change any of that
I will follow your ghost as it climbs up the rock-face
And lie with you on the grass above
And I'd like to change all this
And I'd like to wake up from this
By your side
How did we ever survive for this length of time?
Living with only a care in the world
But the light that shines from her
Whenever she's happy is worth every minute that we've saved ourselves
Maybe there's hope in just one final second
A flash of her love as she waves us goodbye
Don't torture yourself with what might have given
We did everything that we could ever do
And I'd like to chnge all this
And I'd like to wake up form this
By your side.
