Maybe somewhere else
Will not be half as cold as me
The curtains drawn the winter sun
Makes patterns on your face
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise

It's the same [x6]

Baby won't you breathe

Hold me in your freezing arms before we have to go
Bent a little but it's not because I know the truth
The windsheild of your little car is frosted through the glass
The clear heart of air appears as we shiver on the seats

It's the same [x6]

Treat it as a test [x2]
Baby wont you breathe [x2]
It's the same [x6]
