You could get arrested for
getting your kit off in the street
How many times have I told you
It's not polite to meet and greet
We'll get you home and wash you up
In a bath of cold coffee
I only do this cause I love you
And you can make things easier
Didn't you hear me when I said
Not to do this anymore
I've had enough it's got to stop
Or I will leave you then we'll see
If you could handle things yourself
Without me here to scrape you up
This is the last time I'll warn you
Don't make me leave you all alone
It doesn't matter anyway
