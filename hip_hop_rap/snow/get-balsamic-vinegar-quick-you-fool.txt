Cut my eyes out, dear
So I can't see your smug grin
You're right you always win
Untie my hands now
I'm game up to a point
And we're well past bedtime now
All this time away
And I'm freezing cold now
I try hard not to laugh
As she trips up on the step
And her look turns me to stone
I'm closer to the truth
She hates being on her own
But fuck her I'm leaving tonight
Why should I live this way
When I could be with someone else
I don't want to hurt her feelings
But she's a crazy fucked up bitch
