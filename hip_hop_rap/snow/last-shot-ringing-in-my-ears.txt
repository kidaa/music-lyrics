Take her home
Take her past this evening
I'm not sure
Sure if I believe you
You carry a gun for fun
You use it twice as easy
I'm sure she is
She is someone's daughter
I couldn't even feel that it was
Wrapped around my head
I don't know what she's done
I don't even want to think about it
She was beautiful
The prettiest girl I've ever seen
I saw everything
Things I hoped I'd never see
She got away from him
And got on a plane this morning
I couldn't even feel like it was
Wrapped around my head
I'm coming down
Coming down the next day
