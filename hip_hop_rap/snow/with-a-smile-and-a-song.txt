With a smile and a song
Life is just a bright sunny day
Your cares fade away 
And your heart is young 

With a smile and a song
All the world seems to waken anew
Rejoicing with you
As the song is sung 

There's no use in grumbling
When the raindrops come tumbling
Remember, you're the one
Who can fill the world with sunshine 

When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring 

And life flows along
With a smile and a song
