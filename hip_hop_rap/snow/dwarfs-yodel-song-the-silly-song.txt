Yodel:
Ho-la-la-ee-ay
Ho-la-la-ee-ay
Ho-la-la-ee-ay-ee-la-ee-ay-ee-lee-ay
Ho-la-la-ee-ay
Ho-la-la-ee-ay
Ho-la-la-ee-ay-ee-la-lee-ay-lee-o-lee-ay 

repeat 

I'd like to dance and tap my feet
But they won't keep in rhythm
You see, I washed them both today
And I can't do nothing with 'em 

Chorus
Ho hum the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song
For anyone to sing? 

I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out on upon a limb
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him 

Chorus 

Yodel, etc.
