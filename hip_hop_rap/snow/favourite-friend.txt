You're my favourite friend
And I adore you
Love you to the end
No one heard a word you say
You're my favourite friend
We rule the world together
With out secret codes
And plans we can't remember
From now on, must be strong
My favourite friend
You're my favourite friend
When I need you
And when I don't as well
Of course you miss me being around
You're my favourite friend
But I'm older now
I can't pretend
I can't see you anymore
