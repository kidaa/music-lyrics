Yo, check this out right
Harlem on da rise
And you don't want no problem with us guys
M-A-dollar sign-E and if you ever out tryin' to find me
I think I should warn you
I get hard when I want to Angelettie, Bad Boy, niggas ain't ready
[Mase] 
Yo, you the type of cat in the building holdin' the cracks
Sling some to niggas on the corner holdin' the gatts
Nigga come through or nigga kill, never blow back
You the nigga never did but send in all the facts 
Yo, I know niggas like you cuz I meet 'em all the time
And I treat 'em with the 9 if they ever keep what's mine
If I lose I get loc, put a fool in the yoke
Two to his throat, take his jewels and his coat
More than likely, you ain't got to like me
And this might be the last time I take you nicely
For my legion, fill up the season and start squeezin'
Niggas talkin' shit, be behind the cars weavin'
There's no breathin', ain't nobody in here leavin'
You kill my man, I kill your bitch, now we're even
I'm from a cold world, where it's bleeding 20 degrees in Fahrenheit
Niggas get sniped for no reason
Do a lot of work, got plenty funds and many guns
Many sons, niggas do anything to anyone
And on the streets I don't doubt nuttin'  
So when you talk to Mase better watch yo mouth son

1 - 	Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
	You niggas wanna scrap, we can scrap
	You niggas got gatts, we got gats
	You niggas wanna style, we style
	If you get foul, we get foul
	You get wild, we get wild
 	Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
	You niggas wanna scrap, we can scrap
	You niggas got gatts, we got gats
	You niggas wanna style, we style
	If you get foul, we get foul
	You get wild, we get wild

Yo, started with a blue whip, got a silver new whip
Cuz feds watch when I do shit, keep poppin' up new shit
Think the whole Harlem World on some clue shit
We crisp bub sippers, drip club niggas
Peace to the street team, ya'll get love niggas
Six years ago I was the have-not nigga, hot nigga
Represent for all my block niggas
Now I'm 6 drop niggaz, baggette rock niggas
10 G's a show and I ain't even drop niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a pop nigga
You go against Mase you get your wig rocked nigga!
Players like me'll leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop nigga
Hustle is a hustle, so I never knock a nigga
Don't really fuck with Jane, but still I cop jigger
Repeat 1
[Mase]
Yo, I do this everyday, why brag about the glory?
Tell you the whole truth, never half the story
You wasn't no hater, you'd probably be happy for me
Billboard first shot in every category
Niggas say they love me, they don't love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel a vibe when they hug me
Luckily I rock jewels that be chuckie over Iceberg rugbie
Pushin' a Benz buggey, for better badge, roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach
I mean, um, think it's smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke, the niggas ain't cheap, they broke
Oh yeah, this my dough year
Jealousy and envy'll get you nowhere
You don't like me, bet against me
You right, got dough do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight how many links, loosen my ice
And 'for I scoop the dice, bet a grand I be the duece spice
Niggas who'll make dough, I can affily with 'em
I'm dyin' from a sickness known as Willie-ism
Repeat 1 until fade
