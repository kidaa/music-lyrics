Verse 1: Lord Tariq
What, Yo-yo-yo-yo
I'm broken down from keys to oz's to grams
And being sold in city blocks moving hand to hand
Who am I?
You can find me on a corner of your block
And I'm boning powder-forming transform into a rock
Who am I?
I suck the life out of a nigga put your dick in the sand
I'm transported through borders for grams
So who am I?
Small and white like shining so bright
Might take your son's life in the middle of the night
Who am I?
Chopped down a hundred packs for hundred stacks
And I'm sold through a hole through the wall
I'm controlling you all
So who am I?
My pipe game is wicked
And an hour get you by and it can be kinda fitted
Who am I?
I might last for five minutes, but that's all right
Because that 25 Mitch will get you high all night
So who am I? I'm born to kill blacks
And I'm made in the U.S. I'm known as crack
Chorus 1: Lord Tariq
So who am I?
Very small, and I stashed in walls who am I?
I get you high and I'm smoked in halls who am I?
You must come if hear me call
So who am I?
I'm kinda wild, I do a killing with a smile who am I?
I move in file when you hear me go ";Blau!"; who am I?
I'm Teflon so how you like me now?
So who am I?
Verse 2: Peter Gunz
Yo, I travel at the speed of light and it ain't right
And I quick to run up and take your life in the night
I hang with cops and thugs and they call me slugs
Just like Christmas I light shit up
I got cousins and clips
That hang around Bloods and Crips
Mostly found around your drugs and whips
Find me in a artery
Somewhere in your body
While your lying there leaking looking at Lord saying ";soddy";
I was shot at the best
fly Hit many vests
But 9 out of 10 I pierce through many chests
Colorblind, hell if I'm not like fuck it
Kids and ladies and even babies kick the bucket
S'more like a rich bitch in the store shopping
Seven I pop, there'll be a lotta niggas dropping
Majority, minority die when I fuck
But I mean I'm just a bullet and I don't give a fuck
Chorus 2: Lord Tariq
I'm kinda wild, I do a killing with a smile who am I?
I move in file when you hear me go ";Blau!"; who am I?
I'm Teflon so how you like me now?
Who am I?
Unseen and I'm quick to do a killing who am I?
I move fast and I laugh at penicillin who am I?
The type of nigga that'd make ya die
So who am I?
Verse 3: Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz
You can find me in your body if you don't use protection
It's fifty cent all your fucking life learn a lesson
I'm small but deadly, break a nigga down
I know you heard my name cause nigga I get around
Now I pray on the ones who lust for sex and drugs
Shooting out dicks and needles polluting your blood
When I see you, and I see you
Corrupt and I'm up and who you fucking, who she fucking...
Yo I'm the biggest nigga on your block
And I kill more niggas than your glock
Like or not
I'm outta control
Pull your body outta your soul
Than I laugh as I watch your family watch you fold
Now you can catch me but can't kill me
Try to scare but you can't feel me
Mothafuckers just don't hear me
In the year 2010
Probably be the end
I just spread around the world and I do it again
Chorus 3: Lord Tariq
Unseen and I'm quick to do a killing who am I?
I move fast and I laugh at penicillin who am I?
The type of nigga that'd make ya die
So who am I?
What, what
Hahahaha
