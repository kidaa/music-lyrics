Intro: Peter Gunz
Niggas, sick, shit
Lord Tariq:
Now whatchu wanna do, type of niggas
Peter Gunz:
They don't know now, they'll never know, that's how I feel
Verse 1:Lord Tariq
And on the seventh day the Lord made money
On the sixth day, I busted my gun
500 000 is not half of one
Caught the keys akisane for 63 hundred on sale I ordere for Bronx niggas
If you want it, I'll head up with the connect just the game of respect
With the game that I schock, througout the plains of the U.S
Makin clean to this, which is the killer get killed
So why carry if you need a gaselle for real
Peter Gunz:
Yo, when I caught my gun charge, your felony
Niggas ve tellin me, Gunz instead of totin guns
It's all about guns, instead of bustin guns
Nigga get funds and let these niggas know you be the one
So I'm in ?Rhaki's Isle and Kawasaki?
Wrote letters for clans, you never got at me
You heard the block on your phone so I never call
But I know one day I'll be home to dog
And watch you niggas fall
Lord Tariq:
Aiyyo Gunz, move in silence I push that the street
On blocks to Black streets where the murders was meet
And stash money keeps a nigga standing on his feet
And best believe that we play for ?kiki-meat?
The Lord Tariq & PG nigga ain't nothin happenin
So I beeen to the weese, my cars matching the platinum
You think that you's a star, can't happen
Can put down the mics, pull up the girls to get the clappin what
Chorus: Peter Gunz
You got one life to live, one gun to bust
One nigga to save, one nigga to rush
It's all about sex, money, life or death
You gotta make a choice is it right or left
Lord Tariq:
You got one life to live, one gun to bust
One nigga to save, one nigga to rush
It's all about sex, money, life or death
You gotta make a choice is it right or left
Verse 2: Peter Gunz
All my 74 put down a real meeting
Busting the motherfucking gun out
In case a nigga run up, keep a nigga done up
Dark the sun up, be ready to flee
Yo Lord, tell em where you be
Lord Tariq:
Catch me in the Bronx on cosy, surrounded by thug niggas
No love niggas, givin nigga rob, nigga what nigga
Feel a nigga out first avoiding bug niggas
Breaking brand was a big name drug-nigga
Tell me is it in my blood, nigga what?
Deal goin down the park, don't wanna cut, get cut the fuck up
You niggas lust to bust guns, the way a nigga bust none
Nigga trust none, my bust guns will trust funds
So if you ever need a niggabeep me 911
And watch how quick nigga come to leave another num
I'm from Soundview projects where all my niggas from
And uptown just respect to call another nigga dumb
Peter Gunz:
Some say I'm sain, some say I'm off
Label me Roc-a-feller cause I'm hot like stars
I wanna test arousa but I settle for a paw
Shit, you ask me why, let that motherfucker go
Green back, it's time to lean back and set the roll
And if so, your money from this music should I throw
Your rap-shit is platinum, but that other shit is gold
When I see my money-wise, that other shit gotta go
Chrous
Verse 3:Lord Tariq
Yo Gunz, I know there's a lot of niggas scheamin now
Cause they heard that we got it
Peter Gunz
I got another clique for niggas lookin at my pockets
Consider your life equivalent to the shit on my wrist
Lord Tariq
And while we squeezin you can think about this
Peter Gunz
Nigga, six shots to the chest
Lord Tariq
The other 10 to the head
So even if you got your best, you face the color of dead
Peter Gunz
These Bronx niggas wanna bread if you creep you can get it
But keep an eye on your walk, you gots ta take these bullets with it
Lord Tariq
Like blaouw!
Y'all niggas know the deal now, I'm foul
I do a killing with a smouw
Peter Gunz
Now how the fuck you're gonna rumble with the biggest niggas
With the biggest triggers and  Cali-figures 
That's steady blasting on you bitch niggas
Lord Tariq
It be the Bronx nigga borough of kidnappers and rappers
So wanna guard you getting break bradles and cradles
Peter Gunz
It's like plain and simple, the kings of the temple
Be the 1st one to bust you like a pimple motherfucker
Chorus
