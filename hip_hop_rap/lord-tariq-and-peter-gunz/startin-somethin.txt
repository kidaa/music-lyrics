And I'm in a minds state of those, 
That have the world in a zone, in '88
The many cities I roam, 
New York City's my home, 
It's legal money, 
So I got my next flooded with stones
And the Bronx like a quart of my own, 
And I'm from the Southeast, part of the Bx, 
where money ain't a problem
And frequent city blocks from the Bronx
That I haul 'em in, 
Many find themselves in the obituary cloumn
Cause they wanna be

But a blast from the past, 
When I get gas, 
Lettin cats know my only mission's gettin cash, fast
Lord Tariq:

When the shit hits the fan, 
Do you go and see the Lord about confession?
Peter Gunz:

Lettin niggas know what I be doing,
