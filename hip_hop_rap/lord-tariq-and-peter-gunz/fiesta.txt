Verse 1: Lord Tariq
One dres on the six, I resurrect the willie, hottest dick
I'm rich, plotter on your daughter, I'm magician cause I trick
And your man wanna flip, cause I'm poppin that shit

Take the keys to the reigns, black 4.6, cause all the bitches want this
PDS on your fist, platinum on your neck, show part on your wrist

Considered drug-dealers because we spark rollies and

Parked around the corner, laid pipe like a plummer
Ran through her all summer, from tha morning to tha night
And I even trick a little, kepting shorty tight

Verse 3: Lord Tariq
A lot of women wanna be with me
Cause I sport linen, and I hang around with Peter G
And they see me grinnin, rim spinnin on the silver-3
Step to me and ask Lord Tariq are you feelin me

Back in the club we get it on, it's the thug in me
