Verse 1: Peter Gunz
Uh, come on, come on, come on
Uh, and I see you
This is it
In '97 I made plans to see mo' money
In '98 I blasted out in the phat 420
When I hit the block kids stop look and stare
Girls they point, ";Yo that's that nigga over there";
I get a lotta love, lotta hate
Yes that's the bet you make when you see a lotta cake
Now they calling me fake
Shit back they was calling me love
Now they're scratching up my car and calling me blood
See it be the ones you know scheming on the low
Saying you're dope but steady sizing up your Rol'
I drift, to the past where there's no riches
No hits and no chips and no bitches
Just another cat named Peter
Trying to make a dollar off a nine millimetre
Now life a little sweeter
I'm in the dealer
Coppin' a drop
On the beach in Hawaii with Mariah, wop!
Laying up in Wakiki, MTV, figures why these niggas wanna envy me
Maybe cuz this young lady wanna sin for me
Because I ball you got it in me?
But Ima
Chorus: Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq
keep on
Ballin' 'til the day I die
Keep climbing 'til I reach the sky, Ima keep on
Getting money cause it's meant for I
I deserve yo I went for mine Ima keep on
And even though you hope I fail
I turn around and hope you prevail keep on
And to my sisters in the struggle alone
And to my brothers that's locked in jail just keep on
Verse 2: Lord Tariq
Yo in the early days of the Lord everything was shey-shey
Everyday was pay day
Selling nickels and dimes
Getting mine in mind state from 86 to 88
I still hear the razor scrape on the plate
A high school drop out
Caught a case mom expects me to cop out
6-G lawyer fee the case dropped like a knockout
The Bronx was the shit but we all hung in Harlem
Where gettin money's easy spending it was the problem
And I cop 16 valves foot is on the pedal
Telling bitches this your last chance to get out the ghetto
For less I wouldn't settle
Think big you get big
Came across the wrong niggas almost split my wig
Some say I bitched up because I switched up and started rapping
But I'm turning gold crack sales to drugs raps platinum
See these streets through my eyes and you can feel 'em though my words
I swore to god that I'm gon' be heard And Ima
Chorus
Bridge: Peter Gunz
You gotta keep on
just keep on
You gotta keep on
just keep on
You gotta keep on
just keep on
You gotta keep on
To all my people on the East keep on
And all my people on the West keep on
And all my people in the North keep on
And all my people in the South keep on
You gotta keep on
Verse 3: Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq
To my sisters raising kids alone
Feeling stuck cuz your man ain't home
Don't wanna be a father don't bother
Honey, stay on the job
Cuz that man gotta answer to God so baby keep on
I drop a tear on this poem as I write to my dog
Pistol, I miss you sincerely yours from the Lord
You held it down on our side of the town at any cost
And you loved in the checks by Money Boss so keep on
To my cousin G,
I know you're feeling trapped in the chair
All alone like nobody ain't there
Never fear
Me and Touch still here
Remember what I said dog, Ima be your arms and legs you just keep on
And to all my niggas on the streets
Wanna do out the States
Keep your eyes open always look straight
Never fall for the bait
You look back and you might get snatched
And if so just close your trap
You gotta keep on
Chorus
