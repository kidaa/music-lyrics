Somebody, somebody's been telling me 
That you've been doing me wrong now 
What's going on between me and you now baby 
Somebody, somebody keeps telling me to check up on my lover 
Don't care to hear it but what bothers me is 

They all really know about us 
How you keep on doing me wrong 
And then singing that same old song 
And you don't really know about love 
Said I've heard it all before 
And I don't wanna hear no more, you're just like- 

[Chorus:]
My radio you keep playing that same old song 
It goes on and on 
Every time you come my way 
My radio you keep playing that same old song 
And it won't be long before I'm on my way 

Everybody, everybody keeps telling me 
That you're no good for loving 
And there's no way to believe in you 
Because you keep on showing me 
That what they say is true now 
And what am I supposed to do when 

They all really know about us 
How you keep on doing me wrong 
And then singing that same old song 
And you don't really know about love 
Said I've heard it all before 
And I don't wanna hear no more, you're just like- 

[Chorus x 3]

There's nothing you can say to me 
When I don't know what to believe 
I'd rather be without your love 
Than listen to it anymore
