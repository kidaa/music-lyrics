Yesterday was not just another day 
Not like before 
Yesterday I saw your smiling face 
Love walked through my door 
One precious moment changed my life 
One tender kiss made everything right 
One touch from you and this world was mine 
It was in your arms where I found forever 

[Chorus:]
Cried my first tears of joy last night 
Heaven shined a light 
All my dreams came true 
My first night with you 

Felt the sun shine so bright on me 
Chased the rain from my heart 
Through the storm, through the darkest night 
I found my brightest star 
One magic moment 
Made one magic night 
I fell in love with one look in your eyes babe 
I never knew, I could feel so alive 
Darling in your arms I could feel forever 

[Chorus]

One precious moment changed my life 
One tender kiss made everything right, baby 
One touch from you and this world was mine 
It was in your arms where I found forever 

[Chorus x 2]
