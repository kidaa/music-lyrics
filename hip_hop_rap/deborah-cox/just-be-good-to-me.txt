Friends tell me I am crazy 
That I'm wasting time with you 
You'll never be mine 
That's not the way I see it 
'Cause I feel you're already mine 
Whenever you're with me 

People always talk about, reputation 
I don't care what you do to them 
Just be good to me 
Friends are always tellin' me you're a user 
I don't care 'bout your other girls 
Just be good to me 

You may have many others 
But I know when you're with me 
You are all mine 
Friends seem to always listen 
To the bad things that you do 
You'll never do that to me, oh no 

People always talk about, reputation 
I don't care what you do to them 
Just be good to me 
Friends are always tellin' me you're a user 
I don't care 'bout your other girls 
Just be good to me 

Life is a game of chances 
So I'll take my chance with you 
And you I won't try to change 
We talk about it and I'd 
Rather have a piece of you 
Than to have all of nothing 

So just be good to me in the morning time 
Just be good to me, in the afternoon or evening 
Just be good to me 
I'm not the jealous type I won't let you down 
When you need me, I'll be around 
I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me 
We will be together, be together 

I'm not the jealous type I won't let you down 
When you need me, I'll be around 
I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me 
We will be together, be together
