When you're in love 
Some things you take for granted until someone 
Pulls it apart and leaves you with half of your heart 
How do I trade the best I have for less 
Without giving up 
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends 

How do I know 
When to let go 
I know what I'm feeling inside 
But part of me still wants to try 
So tell me 

[Chorus:]
Where do we go from here 
Why's my heart filled with so much fear 
When all that you are is all I need and more 

There's no winning this 
The battle's just begun 
I know it's over, but I still feel the same 
You'll always remain number one 
'Cause letting go 
Warrants so much 
I know what I'm feeling inside 
But part of me still wants to try 
So tell me 

[Chorus x 2]

Letting go, warrants so much 
I know what I'm feeling inside 
But part of me still wants to try 

[Repeat chorus to fade]
