feat. R.L. from Next

To just act like we never were 
To come around and not show hurt 
How dare we greet by shaking hands 
Just months ago I was your man 

Verbally we agreed 
It was over and we were through 
I'm trying to compose myself 
But I just can't get over you girl 

[Chorus:]
We can't be friends 
We can't be friends 
We can't be friends 
'Cause I'm still in love with you 

I went by Mother's, saw your car there 
To her you're still family, and it don't seem fair 
For everyone to just go on 
And I've tried and I can't do it 
'Cause I'm still torn 
I've tried to think of you 
As just another love in my past 
That didn't last 
But it's not that simple baby 

[Chorus]

You may see me staring 
Or catch me in a daze 
May see me hang my head 
When you come my way 
Don't get too close to me 
And expect me to behave 
I might just steal a kiss 
If you come near my face 
What I'm trying to say 

[Chorus]
