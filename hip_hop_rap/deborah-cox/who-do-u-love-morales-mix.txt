Last night I slept alone 
I stayed at home 
For the first time since you've been gone babe 
No friends to understand 
To lend a helping hand 
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known 

You walked so easily 
It still remains a mystery 
Remember what you promised me 
But you went away 
And it's such a shame 
How could you turn your back on me baby 

[Chorus:]
If you don't really want me 
If you don't really love me 
Then who do you love 
If you don't really need me 
If you don't really love me 
Then who do you love 

I gave you everything 
A man could ever need 
I was there whenever you would call me baby 
But somehow your feelings changed 
You don't act the same 
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all 

You walked so easily 
It still remains a mystery 
Remember what you promised me 
And now the lovin's gone 
Oh where did we go wrong 
How could you turn back on me 

[Chorus x 2]

I once was blind but baby now I see, yeah 
That I'm not the one 
Who can fill your every need 
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality 
Now I know, yes I know 
That you're not the one for me, oh baby 

I can't fill your every need 
Now I know 

When the time is right 
And you close your eyes 
And you dream at night 
Who do you love 

[Repeat verse 4 x]

[Chorus]

When the time is right 
And you close your eyes 
Tell me what you're dreamin' babe 
Who do you love
