You don't miss me now 
You don't miss me now 

One day you will 
Be walking down the street 
And you'll see someone and she will look a lot like me 
And you'll think about someone you left behind 
And it will make you cry 

One day you will 
Be starting out your day 
And you'll look inside you coffee cup and see my face 
And you'll realize the sad mistake you made 
And it will be too late 

One day you'll wonder why you ever said good-bye 
And you will wish you were still right here by my side 
But I won't be around 
You don't miss me now 
You don't miss me now 
One day you will 

Never find a love like what we had 
Never find someone like me again 
Through the tears one day you'll see 
That the one you need is me 
You'll want me back again 
You'll want me back again 

One day you will 
Be driving in your car 
And you're gonna hear a song that's gonna break your heart 
And you'll wish you'd said those words you didn't say 
It will be too late 

One day you'll wonder why you ever said good-bye 
And you will wish you were still right here, right by my side 
But baby I won't be around 
You don't miss me now 
You don't miss me now 

One day you will 
Be walking down the street 
And you'll see someone and she will look a lot like me 
And you'll think about someone you left behind 
And it will make you cry 

You don't miss me now 
You don't miss me now 

[Repeat 2 x]

But one day you will 
One day you will
