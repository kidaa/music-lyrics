Oh you think you found somebody that could treat you like I did 
Spend their time doin for you like I did 
And be there when you say I need you like I did 
Now this I can't believe 

Now do you really think she'll hold it down for you like I did 
Take all this foolishness from you like I did 
See if she doesn't she will leave you like I did 
Then don't come runnin' to me 

It could've been you and me but everything I feel is gone 
You had a good thing in me now it's gone 
The love I had for you is suddenly gone 
Away from me 

[Chorus:]
I don't need nobody who can't do right by me 
I don't need you baby 
Cause I'm worth much more you'll see 
So just go cause I know 
You cannot be faithful 
Don't believe she's like me 
Just do your thing 
I choose to leave 

Now when you realize you really had a good thing like you did 
Then you'll realize you dogged me like you did 
Wished you never though of cheating like you did 
Maybe then you'll see 

It wasn't cool breaking promises to me like you did 
Had no reason to deny me like you did 
Had no shame, you still lied to me like you did 
Now it's easy to leave 

It could've been you and me but everything I feel is gone 
You had a good thing in me now it's gone 
The love I had for you is suddenly gone 
Away from me 

[Chorus]

No matter what you do 
Don't care what you say 
Gotta get away 
I won't be second to no one 
I can live with the choice I made 
Won't look back, no way 
I can make it on my own without you 

[Chorus]
