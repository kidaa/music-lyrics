I used to think about it back then 
You walked in and said you're leaving me 
Good-bye, good-bye 
I don't know why I never woke up 
Torch of your love you'd given me had died 
So I erased you from my mind, but- 

[Chorus: Part 1]
Just when I think I'm over you 
I feel your body cry 
Making love to you 
Just when I think I'm over you 
I hear a song that plays 
That we once danced to 

I used to think about how you'd pay 
The way you would hurt 
The way that'd say good-bye, good-bye 
And all the lies, they did you no good 
You'd live with yourself 
I hated you inside 'cause you were over me 

[Chorus Part 1]

[Chorus: Part 2]
Just when I think I'm over you 
I feel the pain again whenever 
I see you 
Just when I thought that we were done 
Baby, time has taught me that you were the one 

When you were there I didn't realize 
All the things you meant to me 
Till you were gone 
And now you're just a memory 

I'm still not over you 
So let's dance, make 'em dance 
Come on and dance 
I'm still not over you 
So let's dance, make 'em dance 
Come on and dance
