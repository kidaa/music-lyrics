You never knew how much you hurt me baby 
You never cared how much I cried 
Baby I gave my heart to you 
You just walked away 
Now you've come back and now you wanna stay 

[Chorus:]
But you're never gonna make me cry again, again 
And your never gonna break my heart again 
Like you did, then 
No you're never gonna make me cry 
No you're never gonna break my heart again 

What made you think that I'd forgive you baby 
What made you think that I'd forget 
Thought you could walk back in my world 
But I've closed the door 
I can't let you in, baby anymore 

[Chorus]

You've had your last one more chance 
There's no more for you baby 
So don't knock on my door 
You're not welcome no more 

[Chorus x 2]
