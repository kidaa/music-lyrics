Someone who loves you 
Wants to give you all you've been searching for 
I've been here waiting 
You don't have to look around anymore 

Don't you know to you I'd give my all 
I'll dry those tears when they fall 
If you just ask me to 
My best I'll do 

[Chorus:]
Won't you call me boy whenever you need me 
Don't be afraid to say what's on your mind 
When you need those loving arms to hold you 
Won't you call me I'll be there just to show you that I care 

I know, I know it's not easy babe 
When you've gotta carry the hurt inside 
But you can depend on me 
'Cause I'll always be there right by your side 
You should know, that when it comes to my love 
I'd gladly give, give it all to you 
Just ask me to 
I'm here for you 

[Chorus x 2]

Don't you know 
If you show me your emotions 
I'll do the best I can to try to understand 
So let go, you'll be safe with me 
Don't be afraid now baby 
'Cause I'll be right there for you 
'Cause you know that you can trust me with your heart 

[Chorus x 3]
