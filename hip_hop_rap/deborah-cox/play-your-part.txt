[Chorus:]
Can you pretend to be the man I should have been with 
Can we fake the life you know I should have had 
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care 
Or I'll have to give the part to someone else 

You seem to have an important part 
The lead role of my heart 
You played it well along time ago 
Until I started falling in love 
And then you changed your character 
And avoided all of your lines 
Now the man I love is gone now 
Can you play his part at this time 

[Chorus]

Love is like a see saw it takes two in order for it to work 
I'm working hard, I'm playing my part but the scene still won't work 
And rehearsals are long because your timing is all wrong 
So I'll find someone who loves me 
And who can play your part for life 

I deserve a lot better than this 
And I'm tired of acting like it's okay for me to give you my love 
And receive nothing back in return 

[Chorus]
