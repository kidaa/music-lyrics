[Chorus:]
How did you get here 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
I've tried that love thing for the last time 
My heart says no, no! 
Nobody's supposed to be here 
But you came along and changed my mind 

I've spent all my life, on a search to find 
The love who'll stay for eternity 
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs 
But when I turn around 
Again, love has knocked me down 
My heart got broken, oh it hurt so bad 
I'm sad to say, love wins again 

So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 

[Chorus]

This time I swear I'm through 
But if only you knew 
How many times I've said those words 
Then fall again, when will I ever learn 
Knowing these tears I cry 
This lovely black butterfly 
Must take a chance, and spread my wings 
Love can make you do some crazy things 

So I placed my heart under lock and key 
To take some time, and take care of me 
But I turn around and you're standing here 

[Repeat chorus to fade]
