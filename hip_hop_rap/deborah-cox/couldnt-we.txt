There were words between us 
Words that hurt inside 
Still that's just no reason to say the word "good-bye" 
We can't let go of something beautiful 
We can't just let it die 
Can't you and I just try to find one reason 
To just give us one more try 

[Chorus:]
Couldn't love heal the pain 
Couldn't time take the tears away 
Couldn't you, you and me 
Try again 
Couldn't we 
Couldn't you, couldn't me, couldn't we 
Couldn't we 

Start the story over 
Turn the page tonight 
There's nothing wrong between us 
That love could not make right 
Can't we forgive and let our hearts forget 
Let the love back inside 
Can't you and I just get back to those feelings 
And feel them just one more time 

[Chorus]

Couldn't we turn back the hands of time 
To a time when love was right 
To those nights when the touch was sweet 
Can't we find our way back 
Before we lose everything 

Couldn't love heal the pain 
Couldn't time take the tears away 
Couldn't you, you and me 
Try again 

Couldn't we stay together 
Couldn't we make it better 
Couldn't we turn the page 
And start the story over 
Couldn't we bring the love back 
Couldn't we have one more chance 
Couldn't we hold each other just a little closer 
[Repeat verse to fade]
