You know i play hard ball
The triplex with them spinal steps
And them parkay floors

The way you smell
The way you sound
And they way you be puttin it on it
The nights alright
But nuthin can compare to the mornin
Cus that's where the love is real at
Up and down in and out tell me if u feel that

Why you wanna mess with me

But you ain't controllin' me, no

Cause I 
Came here to make love not war with you babe
So I try
To find some ways to make me feel good

Up and down, in and out
That's what love is all about 
Always leaves both of us
Feelin' good, I'm so helpless
Up and down, in and out
Love keeps movin' us around
To the beat, like a drum
I don't know if I can catch the rhythm

Oooh...

So why are you keep teasin' me
Mmmh...

Cause you love me so crazy, yeah
