Always the life of the party 
Always the clown of the class 
All of my friends see me happy baby 
But happy is only a mask 

Nobody knows when I'm alone inside my room 
I sing another tune 

[Chorus:]
I'm goin' down 
When I hear the sound 
The sound of my tears 
When you're not around 
It's all I can do 
When I listen to 
The sound of my tears baby when I'm missing you 

Don't mind the sounds of the city baby 
Don't mind the noise of the crowd 
Just when I'm lonely with my thoughts of you 
The silence is always too loud 

Pay it no mind 
You know the truth behind the smile 
It's only just a lie 

[Chorus x 2]

Pay it no mind 
You know the truth behind the smile 
It's only just a lie 

[Repeat chorus to fade]
