Ooh baby I didn't come here to fight 
So why you wanna mess with me 
Ooh I'm always willing to compromise with you 
But you ain't controlling me 

Cause I came here to make love not war with you babe 
So try to find some ways to make me feel good 

[Chorus:]
Up and down in and out 
That's what love is all about 
Always leaves both of us 
Feeling good and so helpless 
Up and down in and out 
Love keeps moving us around 
To the beat like a drum 
I don't know if I can catch your rhythm 

Ooh you know me better than I know myself 
So why you keep teasing me 
Ooh can't see me being with nobody else 
Cause you love me so crazy yeah 

Cause I came here to make love not war with you babe 
So try to find some ways to make me feel good 

[Chorus]

You know I'm in a sexy mood 
So why you gotta act the fool tonight 
You need to change your attitude 
Cause I ain't arguing with you, your right 
You know I'm in a sexy mood 
So why you gotta act the fool tonight 
You need to change your attitude 
So I aint arguing with you your right 

[Chorus]
