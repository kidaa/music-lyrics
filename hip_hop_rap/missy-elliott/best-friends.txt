VERSE 1:
My best friend say 
She sick of me cryin on the phone 
Tellin how the Men are doggin me
My best friend say 
Don't tell her nothin bout me can you girl 
She ain't showin me no sympathy
My best friend say 
If she was me she'd let you go long long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I'll be there
CHORUS:
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need
You can lean on me
Come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you 
In your time of need
You can lean on me
Come on 
I'll be there for you
VERSE 2:
My best friend say 
I can stay with her
At her house no doubt any time I like
My best friend say 
Don't let you ruin my life
Cuz you don't do for me
And you don't act right
My best friend say
If she was me she would let you go long long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
CHORUS 2x
FADE
