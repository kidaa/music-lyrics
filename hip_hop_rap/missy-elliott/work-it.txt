Chorus: 
Is it worth it, let me work it 
I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it 
{*"I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it" - backwards 2X*} 
If you got a big [elephant], let me search ya 
To find out how hard I gotta work ya 
{*"I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it" - backwards 2X*} 

I'd like to get to know ya so I could show-yah 
Put the pussy on ya like I told-yah 
Gimme all your numbers so I could phone-yah 
Your girl actin' stank then call me ov-ah 
Not on the bed, lay me on your so-fah 
Phone before you come, I need to shave my chocha 

You do or you don't or you will or won't yah 
Go downtown and eat it like a vul-tcha

If you a fly gal get your nails done 
Get a pedicure, get your hair did 
Boy, lift it up, let's make a toast-ah

Listen up close while I take it backwards 
Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards [backwards] 
I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want 
I love your braids and your mouth full of fronts 
Love the way my ass go bbompa-bompa-bomp-bomp 
Keep your eyes on my bompa-bompa-bomp-bomp 
And think you can handle this gadong-a-dong-dong 
Take my thong off and my ass go boom 
Cut the lights off so you see what I could do 

Repeat Chorus: 


Boys, boys, all type of boys

Just cause I got a lotta fame supa
