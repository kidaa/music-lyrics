Niggas Gonna Die 

[Shyne] 
I just wanna move mad bricks 
for all the days I never had shit 
Now I'm young heartless and rich 
Pistols and pussy, straight from the door 
Brown paper bags full of blood money, need more 
Too much ain't enough 
High off dust, greed never endin 
Catchin bodies I want Gotti was supposed to be 
It's overwhelmin 
Face smothered in cocaine, against all odds 
Life is what you make it, well I made it 
Leavin motherfuckers naked 
I get excited watchin niggaz bleed helplessly 
Put 'em out they misery, selflessly 
A coward dies a thousand deaths 
I got a thousand tecs 
Takin niggaz with me when I got, fo'rilla 
I'll probably be all pissu when I blow, fo'rilla 
Adrenaline rushin blood bushin 
It's nothin long as I'm bustin 
All gangstas is dead, or in jail 
except for me I posted bail, all hail 

[Chorus 2X: Shyne] 
Money be the root of all evil, calico desert eagles 
Bitch I'm comin to see you, all you niggas gon' die 
Motherfucker die 

[Shyne] 
Fast cars and plea bargains, pictchin niggaz wigs 
Have they families donatin they fuckin organs 
What you like, stress you up, press your luck 
Better hope you hit seven or find yourself in heaven 
Lost my conscience somewhere in between 
watchin niggaz die and leavin the murder scene 
Hot gun in my waist, stockin over my face 
and I tell you niggaz this, I never miss, check it 
My point of view is me or you 
And I'ma burn anyway, what the fuck?  Bust 
seventeen shots up in your guts, truck blood drippin 
Dead on arrival, leavin my rivals 
lookin up at the clouds 
The prodigal son, seein demons and devils 
through the reflection, of my watch bezel 
Embezzle, and racket, full metal, jackets 
Poppin heat and, seekin, niggaz die internal bleedin 
Hear mom screamin, bury Shyne 
Cause when I come, motherfuckers all die 

[Chorus] - 3X {*to fade*}
