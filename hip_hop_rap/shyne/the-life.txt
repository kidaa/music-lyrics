It's a new day in the rap game! 
Nobody sells records but Shyne Po! 

[Verse 1] 
My life had it's ups and downs, but I don't regret nothin' 
I had the whole tri-state high, nigga I ain't frontin' 
at Fifteen I sold my first bag of dope 
used to stick Dominicans, burner under the coat 
gettin' like 15 grams, a half a Ki 
at Fifteen man, a nigga just glad to be 
gettin' some shorts, me and my Man from a Hundred and Fifth 
he knew some Dominican niggas that wanted a clique 
to hold 'em down, shoot niggas in the head 
throw 'em out windows if they were late with the bread 
basically I'm enforcin' 
around heavy coke, when nobody's lookin' I'd be dippin' in the portion 
they wasn't missin' it 
so I got my hustle on the side, flippin' it 
sellin' like 500 bottles and Nicks, started minor 
but I always knew I'd turn a big apple into cider. 

Niggas...niggas just ain't built like me... 
stand up niggas...since 15 
I been servin' fiends and loadin' magazines... 
takin' shots..burnin' blocks.. 
this ain't no fuckin' rap. 

[Verse 2] 
Everything was everything 'till my Man got pinched 
he had a shoot-out with the cops in front of the precinct 
other than that, I went from enforcer to movin' product, straight white 
powder now, gettin' it 
the hardest nigga in the street 
my first car was a 190 Benz with Louie Vaton seats 
buyin' out the bar at the rooftop 
I had a few spots 
one called the jukebox 
where I was gettin' like 50 a brick 
2 or 3 bricks a day, makin' mothafuckas sick 
my Cousin Ron a crook from the Brook was torchin' 
any niggas whisperin' or talkin' 'bout extortion 
shit was goin' right and only one better 
when I got my Italian connect, hittin' me with pure Heroin 
moved to 116th, started seein' real dinero then 
empire buildin', the shit was takin' flight 
had my bitches cuttin' up like 10 Ki's a night 
mixin' lactose, Bonita, and Quenii 
I was the first Black nigga with mafia ties 
leased my soul to the Devil with the option to buy. 
Yo..bangin' for real.. 
niggas is thinkin' rap, I'm thinkin' laundromat.. 
we washin' this money... 
you think this shit is about rhymes... 
you'll find yourself under the fuckin' ground...you know?.. 
we get low when the Feds is in town.. 
this is justice.. 
we playin' the pop charts and still lettin' them things pop off... 

[Verse 3] 
At 21 I was a legend, had the game transformed 
controllin' manufacturin' and distribution of Heron 
throughout the tri-state, high stakes 
I spent Hundreds of Thou's out of paper bags 
you couldn't name a car I ain't have 
every minute new tags 
Seven series to the Five-Sixty drop nigga 
I was givin' away blocks nigga 
fast cars, fast money, slow deaths 
this things of ours 
had me doin' a hundred miles an hour 
through the City evadin' the Feds 
started this shit called the counsel and we all made a pledge 
not to fuck each others bitches 
or touch each others riches 
on top or broke 
never break this oath 
every nigga in the counsel was a boss 
we used to put coke on our dick and make bitches suck it off 
it was alright 'till I got caught 
charged with an Eight-Forty-Eight 
behind Marion steel gates 
niggas started shittin', actin' bizarre 
drivin' my cars, fuckin' my broads, breakin' the laws 
same niggas I took care of and got money wit' was on some funny shit 
if I was different I'd snitch 
what would you do if you got Millions with niggas and they had no love 
for ya? 
couldn't pay for ya lawyer 
I figured shit, why sit in a cell to rot? 
I'll be out in Ten, start over again 
throw those boys in the pot, but I couldn't do it 
you couldn't understand it of you ain't been through it 
there's rules to this shit and I couldn't break 'em 
death before dishonor 'till I meet Satan...I know he's waitin'. 

God forgive me...you've never seen a nigga like me in your life... 
I'm what these lil' niggas rap about... 
thats me they talkin' 'bout in they rhymes... 
I did that time...I flipped that dime... 
shoot-outs, jet planes, cocaine and automobiles... 
The Life...love it.
