Yeah

Haha 
Alright, turn the beat up
I see you, ok!

I see you ma, in your thoughsand doller weave
Master P's diamond face on ya sleeve
Def Island, waist petite

Alright, jimmy shoo shoes on ya feet?
Shoot, right!
Slide inside the spider
I know you tired of guys who try to lie 
To slide inside you
Forget about that, lets go!
Forget about rap, i'm Po
I mean really, i been gettin money
Since niggas is rappin for me
Its fast as shit
Cuz you dont look like, you got your head right
I just hope that u can give head right
Breezin through Eggshell headlights
New York is mine, relax your mind

[Ashanti]
Oooooooooooooooo
Cant nobody
Do them things we do
And cant nobody
Touch me like u do
Cant nobody 
Love me like you do
And cant nobody
Be like me and you

[verse 2]
This is Me!
I'm mostly respected
Ring down to the necklace
Some hos say i'm sexist
Cuz all i wanna do is stuff coke in they breastes
Sit back, lift stakes, count money
In the zone, roll tha doe
Like this, come on
I need a prada chick
To take this dick, and take this script
And flick this shit, base this shit
We can go shopping and buy some things
Up in harry winston ma, try some rings
How you feel like u is prince di
So much cuts on your wrist 
They could draw suiside
No lie, you aint heard?
Extensive trips, expensive whips
You aint seen nothing like this
Not in your life
If i aint that nigga, shit you fuckin right

[Ashanti]
Cant nobody
Do them things we do
And cant nobody
Touch me like u do
Cant nobody 
Love me like you do
And cant nobody
Be like me and you

[verse 3]
Who gon' cop them hos? Po
Who gon rock them clothes? po
Who gon' pop them fros? Po
Well i'm glad you know
No need to ask who holla'd
You aint nada, me alotta
Shyne winton gotta
See you niggas in hell
Now lets prevail, feds on the tel
Just post bail, a million in cash
Now u know that aint rappin pimpin
Please believe that
Body smoked like we was jus ganna clap em' up
That aint enough? then why u backin up
Niggas talkin real greesy on them rap records
Look i'm strip u naked, take ya necklace
Give it to my soldiers like "hold this"
Fuck you nigga u could never fool this
But anyway back to business
Lets play
One CPW come through
I like girls that like girls 
That like girls that like furrs
Ok

[Ashanti]
Cant nobody
Do them things we do
And cant nobody
Touch me like u do
Cant nobody 
Love me like you do
And cant nobody
Be like me and you
