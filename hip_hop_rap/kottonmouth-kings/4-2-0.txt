Ya know I got 2 states of mind, stoned and asleep
First I hit the sweetleaf, and then I have nice dreams
When I get up, I wake and bake, take a piss and shake
My clock stopped at Four-twenty, what you want me to say
I stay blazed all day, no matter where I'm creepin'
Hot boxin on your block, and at the spot on the weekends
You'll see smoke risin', Just who could it be
It's my rhyme and crime partner, D. dash L. O. C.

Yeah that be me born and raised in the suburbs.
Faded off the bud smoke blowin it at you nerds thanks Johnny Richter for your nice little hand
off
I got some purple Kush 
Did you bring the sand box
Let's bounce some bud so we can make a little keefe
Spice up the leaf before we smoke the tree
Everybody in the scene
Know we blow the most dosha
That way they label up the Kottonmouth solders.

we got all types At 4-2-0 yeah our clocks is always altered- we talkin pounds These
anti-hero's are just here to serve you proper Roll that shit up So leave those blessings right
up here upon the alter pass it around at 4-2-0 everybody's burnin Ganja

You'll catch me at the Smoke-Out smoked out, dropping drinks
Havin a blast, not givin a fuck, doin my thing
Blowing rings through the crowd, being loud and obnoxious
Now the shots I did with Pak got me feelin' kind of nauseous
But I played it cool and pulled a few snapps
Big fat packed bowls, and had a chicken Caesar wrap
Dippin through the whole place, no where else I'd rather be
Then smokin' weed with my peeps, now I pass it to D.

24.7 Everyday every minute everybody every stoner grab your bud keep composer beer drinkers,
pill poppers, acid heads and freaks
All the creatures in the street Heroin addicts and geeks
Kottonmouth signed a one way contract to see the world and smoke the killa chromic it's four

Now you might see me on a mission searchin for double-vision
And I ain't no mathematician, more like a stoney musician
But I get a little help from my friends when in need
Hit the bubble, fuck, double, now I'm seein in three's

All these hours and days inter-face with the planet with bubbles and bells the kush is orgasmic
 I transplant my mental to truly titanic fanatic levels for all you bud fiending addict  the
session begins right upstairs in my addict we bless it we roll it we toke it and pass it  the
next time you see us don't take us for granted  we're all getting lifted just the way that we
