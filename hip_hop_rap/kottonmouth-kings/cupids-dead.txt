-you read the papers today- 

I read the news today oh boy, 
About a tragic comedy 
Newspaper hinted suicide, 
The letterhead read Dear Johnny 
A tainted truth was all it said, 
Sleep tight now that 
You've made your bed 
An arrow that once pierced your heart 
Points to the apple on your head 

Three sides to every story 
Yours, mine 
And, Monday morning's 

CUPID'S DEAD, HEADLINES READ, 
CUPID'S DEAD 
CUPID'S DEAD, HEADLINES READ, 
CUPID'S DEAD 

Oh, Romeo, Oh, Romeo 
Where did our love go, Romeo 
If you read between the headlines, 
You wouldn't be the last to know 
No mystery yet to unfold, 
A paperboy left in the cold 
A love was said to never die, 
Withered away and just got old 

'Our top story tonight, 
is a crime of passion 
The victim, an unidentified man, 
is found in bed, wearing only a diaper, 
holding a bow an arrow in one hand, 
and clutching a letter in the other. 
The letter simply read ... 
CUPID'S DEAD.' 

Extra, extra, extra, 
read all about it 

CUPID'S DEAD, 

Cupid is dead, deceased, 
I got peace of mind 
Still it's hard to forget, 
what it leaves behind 
A lot of love lost, 
your feelings are wasted, 
tasted the sweetness, 
but now you're faced with, 
the thought, of being alone 
Nor more companionship, 
you can handle it, 
just abandon it, 
leave it behind, 
and look for the brighter day 
Give it some time, 
cause it won't come right away 
You gotta be standing strong, 
hold on to your dignity 
Don't sit around, 
saying look what ya did to me 
It's time to move on, 
you gotta continue 
to look for a love, 
of a life that's within you 
Cupid is dead now, 
it's time to rely on, 
yourself to cope 
You got no shoulder to cry on 
DEAD
