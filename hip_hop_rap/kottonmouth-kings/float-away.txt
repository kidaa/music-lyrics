Every time I close my eyes I start to drift away- Thinkin bout some days gone by how
time just floats away- every time I hear that song puts a smile on my face- brings me back to
good friends and times that money cant replace

[D:] Everytime I close my eyes I'm lost in a daze
[D:] Thinkin bout the things that I really want to say
[JR:] And all the old games we played at Nickel Nickel arcade
[JR:] Workin at the donut shop, dreamed of getting paid
[D:] And when the dishes got dirty, we got cascade
[D:] And when the weather was hot, we got a spot in the shade
[JR:] Well no lie before we high, always rockin fresh fades
[JR:] Before the spade and the stage we was drinkin underage

Every time I close my eyes I start to drift away- Thinkin bout some days gone by how time just
floats away- every time I hear that song puts a smile on my face- brings me back to good friends
and times that money cant replace

[JR:] Now I was drivin down the ave
[D:] We on the radio now
[JR:] You know the good times we've had
[D:] When we're in front of the crowds
[JR:] Always holdin it down for myself and the boys 
[D:] And back in 95's when we first got live
[JR:] Now we was 18 years old on the run having fun
[D:] Playing shows in the sun, no bus when we begun
[JR:] We had a van and a plan doin shows every night
[D:] Now the California dream we be livin that life

Every time I close my eyes I start to drift away- Thinkin bout some days gone by how time just
floats away- every time I hear that song puts a smile on my face- brings me back to good friends
and times that money cant replace

[Bridge]
when your time comes and you're numbers up
All you have in life is what's left in your cup
When the whistle blows and the party's over
Don't let em drag you out bored and sober
When what's done is done and what said is said
And the dreams you've had are lying in your bed
Let your memories be filled with no regrets
There's no second chance, there's no turning back so..

Every time I close my eyes I start to drift away- Thinkin bout some days gone by how time just
floats away- every time I hear that song puts a smile on my face- brings me back to good friends
and times that money cant replace
