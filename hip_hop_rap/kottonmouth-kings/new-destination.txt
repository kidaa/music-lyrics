where you gonna go when you can't get high now
who you gonna call when you feel so low
where you gonna turn for some inspiration
new destinations is where we should go

Confused in life in the middle of the night
I'm sittin' up with my pipe like my candles I'll burn
thinkin' about my baby the one that really loved me
and the time we spent together callin each other honey
the separation hurts i learned from my loneliness
cryin to myself thinkin about the last kiss
but things got funny we had two different lives
so much time apart and not enough by her side
being without my girl yo im feelin kinda empty
the joy that you've given me can't compare to anybody
moments we shared they was like no other
the bond that we have built it slowly became a cover
but that's how it goes five years down the road
i was away doin shows and let my love up in the cold
i can't ever forget what had happened now its gone
i wanna give you props and shout you out in my song

where you gonna go when you can't get high now
who you gonna call when you feel so low
where you gonna turn for some inspiration
new destinations is where we should go

I can't believe i'm alive
survivin in the world but will i live till 25
i'd bet the farm read my palms when you look in these eyes
theres no room inside for crooked scams or evil plans
not wishin harm I offer out my hand to any man
and when a man extends his hand I offer blessings on his land
upon completion of passage earning respect for your word
build on a strong foundation straight conserve barely splurge
ya gotta plan for the future and take care of yourself
to live a long happy life you never needed no wealth
just be stealth with what your givin make decisions to invest
envision in your mind then hit the kind and be blessed
erase the stress let it go simply cut that shit
you be ruining your day over the same bullshit
and last surpass your past and go don't let your fate be controlled
you should know reach for your goals and that the rest will be gold so

where you gonna go when you can't get high now
who you gonna call when you feel so low
where you gonna turn for some inspiration
new destinations is where we should go

my soul radiates a light that transcends my high
i digest the universe right though my third eye
in touch with my expand it opens me wide
these spirits connect transform and collide
some stay in touch while others divide
some flow and dive and hang around for the ride
some have that day until one has died
shedding your skin born again from inside
so follow the light into a new life 
take a deep breath relax and open your eyes
reality is yours its what you decide
take a deep breath and open your eyes

Baby listen i forgot to tell you something
my life's been a mess without Ami & Dustin
I been depressed popped a couple of biscuits
been staying out all night gettin fucked up what is this
all i feel is the ghost from your presence
thinking about the times we spent together
im fucking over it its too hard reminiscing to the past
we had way too much love and thats a fact
it makes me sad but i gots to move on
so i packed up my stuff grabbed my bong and wrote a song
wondering where my next destination's gonna take me
and how long i got love for ami but now she's gone
