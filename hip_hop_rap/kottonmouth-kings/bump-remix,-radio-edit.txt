Bump, Bump, Bump 
That's the sounds of the 15's while they hittin' in my trunk 
Said Bump, Bump, Bump 
We're the Kottonmouth Kings and we don't give a f--- 

I was livin' my life on the 9 to 5 
Up early in the morning trying to survive 
A chump change, it's a shame with no education 
No inspiration, no destination 
But now my occupation is to do what I like 
Keep the crowd moving and rock the mic 
Cuz if I don't rock it then another sucker will 
And if you don't jock it then I can't pay the bill... 

C'Mon, C'Mon! 

Bump, Bump, Bump 
That's the sounds of the 15's while they hittin' in my trunk 
Said Bump, Bump, Bump 
We're the Kottonmouth Kings and we don't give a f--- 

Said Bump, Bump, Bump 
That's the sounds of the 15's while they hittin' in my trunk 
Said Bump, Bump, Bump... 

Saint Dog putting down for Suburban Pride... 

I'm that pig that the bi----- talk about 
Saint's what they shout, you got all the clout 
A day in the life of a Kottonmouth King 
1605... fool pass me the bing 
Trip Daddy X threw me out on stage 
Said Saint represent for the underage 
Same damn year, my face is up in rays 
Got that ring in my nose labeled 16 gauge 

Nah, Saint Dog, I hunt ducks with a 12 gauge 
And when I'm on the stage, yes I get get real blazed 
Get me on the court my skills will put you in amaze 
T-T-T-Tickin a twine all day 

C'Mon, C'Mon! 

Bump, Bump, Bump 
That's the sounds of the 15's while they hittin' in my trunk

Said Bump, Bump, Bump... 

D-Loc's on the pipe, Rip Rips it up... 

It's the unpolitical, psychoanalytical 
Undefeated champ that'll stick you fool 
My style is crazy not wooka waaka lazy 
If you chill with me I'll be sure to... blaze thee 
It's about time to compute your math 
Cuz my beats keep bumpin' like a seismograph 
And like Mickey Mantle, I can switch my stance 
I'm a supercharged baller that's electrically enhanced. 
My flows are silky soft... like I write and my lesson 
And now a lyricist, poetry in motion 
To each and to each I cause a commotion 
Cops smellin' money takin' off with my portion 
Farewell to all and to all good night 
I'll leave ya these  out all night.. 
Wait, Wait, Wait you said  that shit will suck you up 
Get off the  and rock the bump 

Bump, bump, bump, 
That's the sounds of the 15's while they hittin' in my trunk 
Said bump, bump, bump 
We're the Kottonmouth Kings and we don't give a f--- 

Said Bump, Bump, Bump
