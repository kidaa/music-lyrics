Why do people always wanna know about Richter
what i do at home, how much i really smoke
if i really got as many bongs as i claim
if my bark's about drinkin just a game
well listen up

drinkin vodka blue lable smiroff on the rocks
wishin i had my sack but I left it a Pak's
vape rips got me trippin shit I almost got lost
walkin' up to my own crib comin from the garage
but the night aint over yet i got places to go
hit the bar to get faded but i needed some more
i told him make sure its mean but when he brought my bag of green
it was the B.C. so i only got phaze know what i mean
if you don't thats new lingo a phazers an eighth
i don't get more than an eighth if there ain't crip out on 
the plate, new saying its not crip doesn't mean that it aint kind
it just means the herb you got aint' close to half as good as mine
thats right the truth hurts but not as bad as the dirt,
comin up through your throat when you choke and thats my word,
damn that shit burns i don't even like to think , about the cottonmouth
you'd suffer if you didn't have a drink.

cause these are the types of things i do
and these are the types of tales i tell
people ask me if i smoke i say i do
and the smoke i exhale got that chronic smell

wake up when i want cause thats the life i lead
out every night takin trips every week
hangin out with my peeps just livin the life
only smokin outta glass while you hittin metal pipes
international flights passport gettin filled
you know the show'll be tight if KMK's on the bill
punk rock hip hop pits never seem to stop
when the crowds gettin tired its their heads that bob
i got a job but i aint callin it work
gettin paid to smoke herb aint work its absurd
kottonmouth kings taken over this millennium
suburban noize family i know you will be feelin em
comin out your stereo or seein us on stage
leavin thousands astonished leavin ladies in a daze
people shocked and amazed the weak hearted seem to faint
when they take one hit off of Johnny Richter's dank
cause i keep goin continuously flowin
like the wrappers on my condoms people say that i am golden
flowin like my hydro when i wow those near and far
i'd rather have 10 pounds of chronic then a fancy fuckin car

cause these are the types of things i do
and these are the types of tales i tell
people ask me if i smoke i say i do
and the smoke i exhale got that chronic smell

stumble in the front door throw my jacket on the ground
looked left looked right shit i looked all around
the house was all quiet didn't hear a single sound
grabbed a bottle of bacardi and proceeded to pound
about a quarter way through bout 11:32
headed to Del Taco cause i need to get some food
if not im gonna puke and i dont want that 
shouldn't of drank 20 beers shouldn't have smoked 10 bt's 
couldn't relax that is my stomach of course
shit was comin up fast and it was chargin with force
flew past my vocal cords quickly approaching my teeth
throwin up every color red yellow orange green
there it was for me to see right in front of my eyes
a burrito two tacos and my chili cheese fries
now there's a lesson to learn if you listen right here
beer liquor never sicker liquor beer you in the clear

cause these are the types of things i do
and these are the types of tales i tell
people ask me if i smoke i say i do
and the smoke i exhale got that chronic smell
