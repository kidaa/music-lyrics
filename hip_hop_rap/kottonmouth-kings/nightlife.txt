Well I'm sittin at Saint's, gettin' ready for the party
Sippin' on a tall cat , callin' up the hotties
come over here and get a rip of this dank
I love the lovely herb so i loaded the thang the lord i do thank
The stereos bumpin' got some freaks on the way
Man i need another tall one to get in my sway
The freaks show up we're gonna look like no other
Hey dude watch out she's got a big ass brother
No need to worry, don't even stress
Look at honey over yonder in the tight black dress
Damn you ain't lying no need for dissention
Now check out my skillz as I get her attention

Hey shorty, hey shorty, hey shorty
Girl don't act like you don't know me

Night life, hey girlie don't ya frown
That's right, Saint's parents are outta town
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right
That's right, cuz kottonmouths in the house tonight

We forgot our box of smokes so off we went
Are you alright to drive Nah bitch i'm bent
When i heard that man i knew it was trouble
Bitch was stompin on the brakes like hes Barney Rubble
Back to 22  when we got to the liquor store
Slide on my shades as i walked through the front door
Cuz yo, i was steady blazed, i felt like i was in Jimi's purple haze
I bought a bag of chips cuz you know i got the munchies
And some ruff riders for all the freaky honeys
Hey yo, stop barkin' you're fuckin' up my high
And i got the freak with the light brown eyes
Man pussy ain't got a name on it
Every time loc's drunk he tries to put a claim on it
So if yer gonna crack man you better do it right
Cuz theirs 3 kottonmouths in the house tonight

Night life, hey ladies don't you frown
That's right, Richter's parents are out of town
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right
Kottonmouths in the house tonight

When we got back to the party the place was packed
Look at all the hotties, I'm about to mack
Should we take the back door No lets cruise the front
Oh yeah - and Dloc fire up that phillie blunt
Look over there, bitches straight kissin'
Tongue rings and all, what the fuck we missin

Lesbos, the best lay in town
Lesbos, they like to play around
Lesbos, they're really freaky chicks
The only problem is they don't like to play with dicks

Now the cops just arrived and they're ringin on the bell
Everybody keep it down, i put some clothes on my self
You see here son we've had a few too many calls
There's far too much noise knockin' off these walls
You need to break it up, you're disturbin the peace
Well, I'm sorry officer, fuck the police!

Night life, yo bitches don't you frown
That's right, Daddy Richter's outta town
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right
That's right, cuz kottonmouths in the house tonight

Night life, hey girlies don't you frown
That's right, kottonmouth is in your town
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right
That's right, kottonmouth in the house tonight
