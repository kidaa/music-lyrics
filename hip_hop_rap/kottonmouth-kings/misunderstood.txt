I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared
Fuck the rest, I've failed their test,
I guess life just ain't fair.
A preacher man done told me, said your ways you better change,
But forgive me man, I got a mic in my hand
And it's my time to rock the stage, misunderstood.

One in a million, a million in one
A stoner reeking havoc, but I don't carry a gun
Only a microphones so I can rock the stage,
Don't got a beeper But I got some pages of some dope ass lyrics
From my imagination
Smoked out the officer on my probation,
Bustin caps in the balls of this generation,
I flip this phat verse with no hesitation,
My bro Mad Dog, the south bay psycho, got the bong and bud,
 everlasting cycle, the dates  don't get no sweeter,
My boy B-Dub ain't a mother fucka tweaka,
He's a ganja man, that's the way it goes,
2 turntables always rockin' shows,
Hey Bobby B, how does your bud grow
Shhh....That's on the down low.

I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared
Fuck the rest, I've failed their test,
I guess life just ain't fair.

Kottonmouth komittee made of horny devils, psycho rebels,
Bitch turn up the treble,
We wanna be heard 'cuz we speak the truth,
Yo we miss Rob Harris in the DJ booth
And that's the truth, cuz that's the roots,
We miss Rob Harris in the DJ booth.
Yo all I'm sayin' kid is the freedom of speech,
A freedom to blaze, a freedom to reach,
New plateaus are a high away,
2 joints in the morning then I'm A-OK,
I smoke two joints in the morning,
Get the vodka then I mix the OJ, okay.

I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared

I'm D-Loc I puff all the smoke,
Never have herbs cuz I'm always broke,
Never had a job, probably never will,
That's right Saint Dog, we kings of the hill.
I'm Saint Dog never find me trippin',
Never gun grippin', always 40 sippin'
Anarchy is the life of me, give me booze, blunts, broads
And I'll tap all three,
I got a German glow with an irie flow
You're red in the face cuz I bucked your hoe,
So what now bro You know we told ya so,
We got more game that L.A.'s got blow
Yo my boy D-Loc got ears like a monkey,
My boy Saint Dog is a hip-hop drunkie,
DJ Bobby B gots the tracks that are funky,
If you really must know I grow my green bud skunky
