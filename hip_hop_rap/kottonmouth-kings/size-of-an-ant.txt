Sittin' on my front porch sippin' on my pipe, 
Lizard on the bowl blownin' gold shit was tight, 
Early in the morning 7:30 a.m., 
Snatchin' nugz in the  from the walls of my den, 
Living in a bud plant, I hollowed out the stem, 
Two stories three rooms it's my Kryptominium, 
My domain now remains supplied in , 
All I do is clean my crib and clip the water leaves, 
Free relief is always offered from the great O.D. 
Standing seven feet tall my toupee huge tree, 
Is lovely smells so fruity I'm fucking hoopy, 
Flying like Woodstock barking orders like I'm Snoopy, 
Excuse me, pardon it's time for a session, 
We press on heading on up to the top section, 
Everybody is invited, I prefer those heavy hitters, 
You know someone down to smoke I really hate those stay and quitters, 
So it figures Loc is rollin' Bobby B ain't far behind, 
Daddy X and Pakelika come in swinging on some vines, 
To the tip top of the tallest Kola we begin to climb, 
Sugar smokes some  ropes and a gang of Keif, 

Where Are We 
Trapped in a plant the Size of an Ant and we're stuck to the sack, 
How high It's the Kola, 
We got no map and forgot to pack a back pack, 

D double dash L O C, I popped out my bud plant clearly, 
Invisibly see through ya'll can't find me, 
Completely blind like an erased line, 
Stay refined disappear go away like bad emotion, 
I'm over here camouflaged in my potion, 
Ya'll can't find me I'm slick like Rick, 
Got an oldschool flip equipped, 

Vanac Spits! 

 to the mic I become attached, 
Imagine if I grew branches from my body limbs crowded, 
Out my mouth like chlorophyll dispel all skill whack MC's, 
 decapitate immortals, 
Now growing vines from my arms I'm like the swamp thing man appearing in plant, 
Form plasma ejected complicated , 
Dynamic apparatus combindin' for rhyming , 

Everlasting grow room wired with the bass boom, 
Krispy colored nugs is another called the typhoon, 
Full bloom flowerin', sky scraper towerin', 
Endless sea of green, hydro lights that be powerin', 
Full drip system frequent mistin', 
Tropical planet so all the buds they were glisten, 
Rollin' cones all day, runnin' round underground, 
Bobby's bud's are where I stay and I'm the Size of an Ant, 

Where Are We 
Trapped in a plant the Size of an Ant and we're stuck to the sack, 
How high It's the Kola, 
We got no map and forgot to pack a back pack, 

I reside in the bud the nugs about dove, 
Life in the bag of the blueberry love, 
I'm feelin' my dust so I climb to the core, 
It started getting chilly cuz the weather's gettin' colder, 
I grabbed my folder, write a rhyme and called Kona, 
He came over, then we rolled up a hooter, 
Jumped on the scooters and we found the lines, 
You know I fumbled my rhyme, 
Stoney trail rides, we smokin' spliffs by bricks, 
It's a myth the gift to get lifted, 
I gave the plant a sniff then I kissed it, 
I made a wish the rest got blessed, 
I'm living in a plant the Size of an Ant, 
It's 4:20 now it's time to react, 
No need for a sack cuz I'm sick of runnin' laps, 
Look down by my feet and saw a little piece of ant crap, 

Where Are We 
Trapped in a plant the Size of an Ant and we're stuck to the sack, 
How high It's the Kola, 
We got no map and forgot to pack a back pack,
