Yo man I got some sick ass shit, I got all kinds of bongs.
I got fuckin, I got paramaxes, I got graffix
I got all the dope shit
I got superbowls, I got fuckin skunk weed, I got skillz, listen
I'll get me on the court, you know what I'm saying I got skillz.
Look I got crossovers, I got doms, I got lobs, I got ups
I got all kinds of skillz,
I got homeboys, I got weed, I get high. I'm fuckin
I got dope VW car with fat ass fuckin whomper, motherfucker...

I gots the light if you gots the time
I gots the joint if you gots the rhyme
I gots the ink if you gots the papers
I gots the flow if you'll catch the vapors. Crazy man.

Suburban ebonics coming out my mouth.
Take a lesson bitch boy that's Kottonmouth.
But your square nerdy asses won't understand.
So yo, break em off a fat ass piece man.
Dirt slang, it starts like this bro,
I play dunk ball with the homies and I eats pink taco
714 bustin up yo ass.
Suburban white bonics they don't teach in class.
It's the psychedelic hip hop punk rock shit.
So let me tell you mother fuckers who your fucking with.
Well I'm Saint Dog and I spills my schpeil.
When I gets lit I like to bark some shit,
Like it sucked up, cracked out, cock out biatch,
I only take licks and a  rip.
I got you puzzled like the wrinkles on my scrotum sac.
I got a gang a year, I keep my kicks on a rack.
From Airwalks to Bocks to Docs to Birkenstock
Top it all off with some old skool socks.
No wonder why your old lady rides my jock.
I got her tied up like a boat to a dock.
Yo I twist up your mind with my wicked hog slang.
Uck-fay ou-yay umb-day itch-bay,
Aint-say og-day ever-nay lays-pay.
Now that's the type of shit comin slurred from Saint.
Emergency, emergency 911, Kottonmouth's on the mic
So you bitches better run.

I gots the light if you gots the time
I gots the joint if you gots the rhyme
I gots the ink if you gots the papers
I gots the flow if you'll catch the vapors.
Crazy man. Dirt slang.
