Life ain't funny when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 4:20 and you wanna get high
No bills get sent and you can't pay the rent
Everyday I get bent yo, so that I can get by
On and ontaking rips from the bong
Planet Budtron, BSO stay on
Kottonmouth Kings got them dope tracks
1605, yes they got my back
I'm buckin your booze cause you smoke crack
I get the munchies and I eat a greasy Big Mac
Finding me smoked out ain't unlikely
That's why my homies call me D to L-O-C
You'll catch me at a party deep in OC
Representing that punk rock stylee
When I'm on the mic I make the crowd move
To escape reality I bust my own groove
Ladies on the floor say you're so smooth
I wink my eyes in reply, they says "Real cool"
Life ladies wouldn't understand me
Sense coincide to be in anarchy
Skate in my hand cause I'm like that
Bust a circle off the curb cause I'm real phat

Life ain't funny when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 4:20 and you wanna get high
No bills get sent and you can't pay the rent
Everyday I get bent yo, so that I can get by
On and on taking rips from the bong
Planet Budtron, BSO stay on

I'm D Loc, go ape like shit
Smoke bud with the king click
Don't trip, but addicted full throne
Cant stop smokin that homegrown
I got a fat blown acre out in Riverside
Hall brooke locals, the kings reside
E Loc, G Mac, Big Hoss in the pen
BJ, Gweedo, and my boy Efrem
I go coocoo for cocoa, chocolate thai
Smoke bud till I die, if you wonder why
Stay high like a black fly
And then I sigh, buzzin like a busy
Biz-I bye bye bye bye

Life ain't funny when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 4:20 and you wanna get high
No bills get sent and you can't pay the rent
Everyday I get bent yo, so that I can get by
On and on taking rips from the bong
Planet Budtron,BSO stay on

Saint Vicious pay attention let me educate
I break tapper in the gut of this legislate
Push em tap and I watch em slowly drain out
Lies lies lies is what I'm talkin about
Not old school like I'm used to
Kottonmouth Kings just broke through
Psychedelic hip hop punk rock shit
So back the hell up
You get smacked in your lip
Saint Dog quit I'm from the old school
I'm blockin half pipes here to skate to
Launch rip rail slide slid it real smooth
No skateboard but it was still cool

[Chorus]

This has been the Kottonmouth Kings
Transmitting live from planet budtron
With fellow B at the helm
High at the Argon House
Bobby B
Saint Vicious
D Loc
And I'm Daddy
Sayin work hard
Play hard
And skate hard
Oh, and ah one more thing
Check please
