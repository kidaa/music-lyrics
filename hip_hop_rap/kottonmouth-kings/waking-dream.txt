The earth the wind the sky the sea the birth the life the air we breathe- The truth
the lies the in between the hate the love the waking dream

All these beautiful things growin up in California and all the members from the people who new
ya! Don't test Mother Nature she's a powerful person 
Don't get caught up in a bind for bein stupid like abortion
These are the types of checks you can't cash when your trying to live long can't afford to be
an ass or when you walk into a party being loud and obnoxious or when you walk up to a hotty
wish no respect and compliments it's fuckin nonsense this life's a journey all people I need and
al the people actin funny like crash test dummy's people come people go like liquor sto doe they
except it like a treasure some one paid is another man's pleasure 
We need to stick together to make t his beautiful place better 
You're times approachin in this like your livin in the aftermath of the new begin

In the aftermath the new beginning- In the waking dream of all things unseen the cycle is
complete the universe has justified my life and set me free- A smile spreads across my face
prepares me for the ride- the setting sun begins to set the perfect way to die

The earth the wind the sky the sea the birth the life the air we breathe- The truth the lies
the in between the hate the love the waking dream

I'm sittin in the basement, cause we about to get deep
Final life's placement, bein the topic of speech
What matters to you and me, what goals you've reached
When you're body's laid to rest and your soul's free to seek
With the knowledge you receive, You got a spot picked out
You know where you wanna go from what you've learned about
Some people call it Heaven, other's say the spirit world
Where you goin when you die Are you sure For real
You ask me where I'm headed, I'm still tryin to look
I learned one thing so far, the answer's not in a book
Many paths to choose from written by the hands of man
But they were all still alive, the information's second-hand
I don't understand, cause all religion's have flaws
Barkin out commandments, how 'bout Nature's laws
Cause when it's said and done, rivers still gonna flow
The wind's gonna blow, and trees are still gonna grow

In the aftermath the new beginning- In the waking dream of all things unseen the cycle is
complete the universe has justified my life and set me free- A smile spreads across my face
prepares me for the ride- the setting sun begins to set the perfect way to die

The earth the wind the sky the sea the birth the life the air we breathe- The truth the lies
the in between the hate the love the waking dream
