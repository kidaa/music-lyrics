I see you couldn't catch your breath
Believe me it's all that it must be
You see I never said my piece
If only you left it that easy
Fractured we have been since sometime sixteen
Failure was on me but your ideals bore me

Does it take the fireworks to make you look in wonder
Would you give reaction to the cause I'm under
So colored by you but your monkey messed it up
Uncovered by you your monkey's longwhile had enough
You're like scissors in my coat
You're like splinters in my cup

I know you couldn't care me less
Keep hoping it's all only token
You know I never had my say
If only you'd keep it that open
Loser may have been but it's lost on me
Splintered I will be when your peace breaks cheap
Does it take the fireworks to make you look in wonder
Would you give reaction to the cause I'm under
Three color blind you but your monkey messed it up
Surrendered by you your monkey's longwhile had enough
You're like scissors in my coat
You're like splinters in my cup
