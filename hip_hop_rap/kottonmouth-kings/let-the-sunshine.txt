You see i can see light in the strangest ways, on the darkest nights and the coldest days, and im amazed
that some how that i can keep smilin, i can hear music in the depths of silence, i can find peace in the
middle of violence and i can be calm when i should be wild and i can find hope when there is despare and i
dont feel alone when theres noone there.
