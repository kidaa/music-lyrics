EVERYBODY MOVE [X3]

Everybody move now take some action, make some action YEA, take some action 
Life is short and fast thats why I mean action, revolutions got to happen 

Everybody move right now right now [X4]

Everybody move right now right now 
Till this mother fucking place starts falling down 
And everybody grove owe yea owe yea 
If your down with the kings throw your hands in the air 
And keep em up in the sky if you like to get high 
Keep em up in the sky if you feeling the vibe 
And represent for your city let me know were you from 
I'm yelling out P-town at the top of my laughs 
Till my last breath ima keep doing my thing 
Put it down for the krown and steadily smoking on the green 
Like a boxer in the ring mind ya bossiness man 
Wanna step on stage with the mic in my hand 
So get your ass up come on come on get your ass up 
Get your ass up if you don't give a fuck 
And everybody move right now 
Cause right now is the time to get washed 
Let me show you how 

Everybody move right now right now [X8]

This is a water shot thats the laser dot 
Daddy x son I get high allot 
A little free for thought you wanna rule the block 
And never get caught slipping like a broke dot 
In a slipknot that means neck slit 
Let it rat an you can't instruct a snitch 
Keep your eyes pealed and your game tight 
Cause it the drug war theres always time to fight 
Keep your head high don't be a fraud 
one of a kind dog thats who you are 
You gotta earn strips I got brute scars 
I revolutionize revolution wars 
Free thought time free think tank 
Free speak keeps costing people big panic 
How many jail cells are filled with people man 
It's time to move stand up and take action 

Everybody move right now right now [X8]

If your gonna move now take some action make some action YEA take some action 
Life is short and fast thats why I mean action revolutions gotta happen 

Now it's time to rock the party double dash move the crowd 
I get that shit hyped with my so-cal style 
Real smooth cat lay back let the beat thump 
Let the beat bump light buds up 
We get to bad we getting fucked up 
Got the people in the back with there hands up 
Kmk mind we got this shit locked down 
>From the east to the west like balm 
The underground sound that your hearing right now 
The king klick dog blowing killer chronic clouds 
Put your swag down got no time for the krowns 
Kottonmouth king aka the dog pound 
The west coast bomb shit were the bombs lite 
Sack full of indo pocket full of chronic 
Beer in my right hand mic in the other 
No body do it better d-loc motherfuckers 

Everybody move right now right now [X8]

Everybody move Get your ass up [till song fades out]
