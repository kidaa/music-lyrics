No turnin back now going out full throttle Puffin crazy mad herb with our hands on
the bottle.. We some Stoners Reaking Havoc we ain't no role models- No turnin back now no turnin
back now daze tensions high seems everyone's on edge walking over pits of fire on a skinny ledge
now daze you loose control its take what you can get where anarchy reigns supreme you ain't seen
nothing yet now turnin back now we going out full throttle

Watch out, back up, cause this is the fast lane
I got a lead foot, heavy boots, and 3 hoots on my brain
Ride looks like its on fire, but you know my engine's clean
I'm just smoking the tires, racing off every green
Step up, Step up, If you got a little somethin'
But your rev better be louder then my system that is bumpin'
Don't come round me talkin shit if you're not built to the brim
Cause now you gonna get whipped, I never lose, I always win
Where you at, right here, and there's plenty more comin'
See when the Kings' is in the house, everybody comes runnin'
Meetin in the parking lot, to smoke pot before the shows
Hookin up with all the ladies, takin home all the ho's
We having fun, Fuck Yeah, Will it stop, Fuck No
I'd still be tokin', blowin' endo even if I was broke
Ain't that right D-Loc hell mothafuckin' yeah!
Fuck a fist or middle finger, throw your horns in the air.
