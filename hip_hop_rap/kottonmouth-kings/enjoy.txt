So enjoy my good friends may these good times last cuz in this lifetime they
come-n-go to fast one day your sittin on top next day your fallin off fast- So enjoy my good
friends make these good times last

My gas tank's to the top, with a freshly picked crop
New album 'bout to drop, met a girl I like a lot
Things is on the up and up, like they never gonna stop
Eatin meat that's butcher cut, drinkin sake at Hibach
No rocks on the wrist, I ain't into those things
Silver plugs in my ears, the only things I bling
Maybe a big fat ring, but you won't see no jewels
I don't need a diamond link to make these ladies druel
I just play it cool, maybe throw them a wink
Yannow, buy em a drink, ask them What do they think
About exchanging the digits, that's just how I'm livin
Cause sex could be bought, but love is only given

So enjoy my good friends may these good times last cuz in this lifetime they come-n-go to fast
one day your sittin on top next day your fallin off fast- So enjoy my good friends make these
good times last

I'm consistently on one my middle name done
I'm still spun from lasts nights vodka and rum
I popped a biscuit got with a hotty ever hunny in the party
Had a bangin body
The beer kept callin me
The buscuy started to roll
I'm rollin but I'm under control
And if I get out of control you betta slow me down
E and my homie chucky chuck gett'en up like circus clowns
Chucky styles and the D-Loc 
I'm stoned to the bone eaten K.F.C 
We back home from the party up w Hollywood Hills
We was popping some pills and all the alcohol was reel 
Drunks throwing up flicken cigarette butt's people fightin
In the streets thinking their tough
You know what we was on the balcony Laughlin
Smoken buds flicken beer bottles while people were dancing

So enjoy my good friends may these good times last cuz in this lifetime they come-n-go to fast
one day your sittin on top next day your fallin off fast- So enjoy my good friends make these
good times last
