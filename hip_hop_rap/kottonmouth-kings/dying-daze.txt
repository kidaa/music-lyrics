are ya living to live
are you living to die
are you living a tale 
are you living a lie
you got one life to life
are you living it right
you've got one life to live
who wants to ride

everyday i do it my way
live my life the way
i dont care what they say

dying daze
ridin till my dyin daze

im sick of watchin birds spill
im sick of chasin dollar bills
im sick of systems tryin to seal my fate
i'd rather taste the sunshine with some endo
i wanna climb waterfalls all day
i wanna open sky with my psychedelic eye
i wanna ride around the world today
and if i never make it home 
i know my soul is gonna roam
im gonna ride until my dying day

ridin till my dyin daze

i've been all around the world 
from the east to the west
japan to LA i said damn take a breath
livin life fast put the rest in the past
till my dyin daze i'll go ridin to the last
and until my dying days i'm living
life to the fullest, staring at the rip cord
wondering when i should pull it, thinkin i wanna
stop but know i gotta go faster, gonna go
till i'm broke then throw me out to pasture
alright johnny richter  get the picture
knowin damn well how we flip these scriptures
the beats gonna hit ya, ya feel that vibe
its a dance hall funk with the punk rock rhyme
so get down to pit cause its gonna explode,
circle gonna blow from the first distant go,
whether hittin 5th wide or chargin 12 step
gaps, thats it when you commit cause theres no turning back.

ridin till my dyin daze

im sick of watchin blood spill
im sick of chasin dollar bills
im sick of systems tryin to seal my fate
i'd rather taste the sunshine with some 
i wanna climb waterfalls all day
i wanna open sky with my psychedelic eye
i wanna ride around the world today
and if i never make it home 
i know my soul is gonna roam
im gonna ride until my dying day

ridin till my dyin daze

last chance gotta chose a path, either hit the brakes
or give a fist full of gas, give a last push on hope
your pegs on tight, cause loose screws won't do 
in the middle of flight.
