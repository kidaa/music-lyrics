I got a fat bud in the case of my guitar 
I got the flavour of the month chillin in the jar 
i got that Whitehouse buying president 
I got that Nassau spaceship THC 
I got some weed in my garage and under my bathroom sink 
ounce in my xbox living room by my TV 
I got a nug on my desk and in my dresser drawer 
and when I'm running low my hidden stash is in the floor 
furthermore I got some backup underneath the stairs 
and the eighth I got stashed in my underwear 
wrapped in my sweaty balls , that's why I'm flying high 
you wanna take a lick, trick , taste it good life...

imp flowing outta the vents into a Lincoln cont. 
or my dropped Cadillac bc I done did it again. 
I'm back to ballin to win, don't let me hold it all in 
I only need five breaths but fucking calling it 10 
getting control of those ends, blowing smoke like the wind 
I'm back to Rollin in my bus, don't even let me begin 
cause when I'm in it , I'm in, when I'm out it, I'm out 
these cats are loopy bout prints they got a problem no Doute, 
I call it fifty fin and my lair's my house, 
I got one rule there it's don't show up unannounced 
gotta call before you roll through, get the all cool 
I might be like wait up , yo I'll call you 
cause no one knows what Johnny Richter's got chronic 
but when it's cracking, we be the toughest motherfuckers that's cracking 
but anyway...
