In the aftermath, of a battle won
we celebrate with the rising sun
Sub Noize tribe good god we on the run
and we wont stop till the war is won
because we strong like a green beret
special forces of peace and unity

day to day song to song the battle rages on
replenishing my soul the mighty power of my zong
when i'm thinking bout back home when i'm wondering why
how'd i end up on the road what's the effect on my life why

like a fugitive we on the run
runnin like were under the gun
you know we do it all for you
because your motives are true
we're on the run till the war is won
our work ain't done
you know we'd rather be with you

on the road doin shows my life's been crazy
for the past 5 years its been me and my lady
only good things come for those who truly believe
all the time i spent alone i never thought i would leave
so in life i live and learn i aint takin nothin back
with the things that have happened that are makin me sad
another day goes by gotta show respect its a love that i give and that i dont regret
another town down another show we musta wrecked another day
close to being home i get, with the tears blood and sweat
the sacrifices made, if there were fans and a P.A.
then we wanted to play, way before gettin paid way 
back when we was dreamin', when i worked the nine 
to five to cover up the triple beamin, when i never
thought of leavin have you always by my side, how'd i
end up on the road what's the effect on my life why

like a fugitive we on the run
runnin like were under the gun
you know we do it all for you
because your motives are true
we're on the run till the war is won
our work ain't done
you know we'd rather be with you

 penetrating zongs
the freedom fights on we multiplying like clones
every day's a new day gettin high feel lovely
enlighten minds we're trying to rise above see

for too long 
they haven't treated us right
their motives wrong 
cause its the people they fight
we sing this song 
so everybody unite
freedom fighters keep pushin on
