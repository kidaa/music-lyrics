Hi kids 
Welcome to cloud nine 
We sure are glad ya stopped by to see us! 
We got some special suprises for your red asses today 
We got the insane clown posse, in the studio with the kottonmouth kings 
Put your thinkin caps on and think for yourself! 

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves 

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves 

[Verse 1 - Daddy X]
This life time here 
Shits kinda funny 
Seems like everybody's out for the money 
Everybodys chasin fake fortune and fame 
The worlds gone insane it's like we lost our brain 
Got the poparazzi snappin pop culture 
We feedin on the copies like a packa vultures 
I don't give a fuck about brittany or rehab 
She gobble nuts 
And look like a skinhead 

Lindsay lohan can swim in the ocean 
With two cement shoes and some calamine lotion 
Paris hilton can be worth a billion 
I wouldnt fuck that bitch with madonna's 10 children 
Baby surrey or angie jolina can drink pipe cleana from missadobaleena 
Missadobbaleena missabobdobbaleena 
I gotta big fat spliff with patron ta kill ha 

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves. 

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves. 

[Verse 2 - Insane Clown Posse]
Ryan seacrest gets a fist through his weak chest 
And all the millionaire hot hoes get skeet spits 
I gives a fuck whos drunk and fuckin at the grammy's 
Loco breakin up or too fuckin skinny 
Lil kids walking home mad miles a day 
'cause they moms ain't tryin ta fuckin miss judge judy 
I WILL STAB YO ASS 
I send they ass to alaska 
I think for myself like a samauri has ta 
Who is who or anybody else to review what anybody else do 
And who the fuck is who to tell you 
Ask the magic eight ball 
Call a psychic hotline 
I don't need your opinion on shit 'cause I got mine 

Think for yourself original and authentic 
With this fresh lifetime we get to ride on this planet 
There's two many followers 
Dumbasses by the masses 
You betta think so hard you fuckin shatta yo glasses 

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves. 

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves. 

[Verse 3 - D-Loc]
I make my own moves so I set my own pace, 
I got my own rules double-dash is the name 
I do my own thing like the president does 
Sometimes I'm like fuck the world 'cause I don't give a fuck 
When I do it let's do it every time we gettin to it yeah yeah we gettin to it 
Clownz and the kings we back at it again 
You know we dippin again 
So go run and tell ya friends 

[Johnny Richter]
Go and tell ya friends 
Better yet, alert the public 
Kottonmouth kings with icp and people lovin it 
Think for yaself 'cause I'm thinkin bout me 
Havin fun in my life and makin sure my family neva has to worry bout the bullshit at hand 
Takin care a everbody livin in my own land 
Take a pitcha 'cause it lasts longer face the fame 
Id rather do my own thing than play ya sick little game! 

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves. 

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true 
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.
