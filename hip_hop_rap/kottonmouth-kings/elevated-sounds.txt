There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps,
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach,
Complete, unique, in all the way around,
Give me a pound from East to West Bound,
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,

Plant leaves from a tree descend from a seed,
Growing time is a crime separation misery,
Fearlessly, I'm livin' life positively,
Spiritually it's evil living carelessly,
Emotionally, sometimes you sit and think,
By yourself consequently remembering the past,
I laughed I skipped class,
Eventually negativity don't last,
Growing time takes time,
Pure love will never clash,
Potentially stay real and show skill,
Fill the field, seal the deal,
Cuz there's no time to kill,
Hill over hill,
There's a long road ahead of us,
Now-a-days I'm meeting people I can't even trust,
Love not lust, good things can't be rushed,
I'ma keep my head up, let my karma be plushed,
Watch me as you analyze my style imitate my ways,
For days you amazed,
A purity and pays you better change your ways,
You caught up in a daze...
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a daze,
Yo, full of evil rage wrong people wrong place,
It's time to turn the page because life is not a phase,
Day after day, what can I say I blaze like a trail, inhale and get glazed,
So check it,

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps,
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach,
Complete, unique, in all the way around,
Give me a pound from East to West Bound,
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,

Cannot keep spinning on it's axis,
The world is separated into two different factions,
The elevated sound and the people who will follow,
Cuz the people who will follow are the people of tomorrow,
Now come with me on a journey through my mind,
Intrigued definitely respectably you seek and you find,
The answers to the rhyme meditation and some kind,
Your time is right now so go an seek the truth,
Dig up your roots, get to the bottom of things,
My family came in a boat we didn't own no chains,
But things remain unchanged different team, same game,
Outcome inevitable your just a puppet on strings,
We breakin' down the walls with the elevated sound,
Johnny Richter, Daddy X, and D-Loc from P-Town,
We ran a rough edge and with a tracer like bic,
I levitate out the place with a huge bong hit,

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps,
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach,
Complete, unique, in all the way around,
Give me a pound from East to West Bound,
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,

You can't deny that we rockin' states,
Picking up vinyls supplyin' in crates,
Mpcs 808s in the mic,
Digital soundin' shit shows tight,
Bass drums and beat boxes,
Ya'll can't stop this D-Loc and X, DJ B and that Pak kid,
Johnny Richter bout to spark it,
In the darkness, with the Lochness monster,
420's no questions nothin' but cest strains,
All day everyday we all about the indo,
The bongs the blunts and the different kind of homegrown,
Blueberry to purple ????,
Cannabis cup what roll it up I'm on tour
Don't forget the show I spit and I glow,
Rearrange beats in my mouth no joke,

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps,
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach,
Complete, unique, in all the way around,
Give me a pound from East to West Bound,
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down,
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round,
