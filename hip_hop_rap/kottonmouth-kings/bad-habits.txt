A pack a day Cigerettes seven grams of weed chronic A beer when i'm ready Bud light
Yall know me, Who? yeah I got some habits, I picked up a few, it's the d-lo-c so what chu gonna do?

The demons inside me, are clinging so tightly, the voices in my head say "You don't wanna come down" m'kay.

A pack a day to get me by, an ounce of weed to keep me high
Alochol still numbs the pain, some things in life just never change

It's the d double dash, I bash like an army, and when it's time to mash, I crash really strongly

Your eyes they just won't open, you don't know what you been smoking
Got your whole family hoping "Oh I wish that he'd just slow down" slow down
The game is tough and silent where these groups are just smokin', soldier.
You're smoking and then toking and you're dead in the ground Na Mean?
