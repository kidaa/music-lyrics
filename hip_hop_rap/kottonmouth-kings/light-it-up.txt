wishes so make em' all count with sworn secrecy there's no dollar amount wish one would be tons
of unlimited pounds of lof legalized chronic and infinite sounds wish two would be miles and
miles to roam with no boarders or rules planet earth would be home wish three well that's kind
of easy to me there'd be peace, love and equality

Mary Jane is who I dreaming of
The one I adore
And the one I love
The beautiful lady
She so so sweet
My for everlasting love
That I always wanted to meet
Know all my friends say 
That she got a good vibe
An ever time they see her
She get's em high
She so so sly
And she my flyest baby
The one and only Mary
That drives me crazy
No we feel so good
You can't deny
Are sprits together
Will never die 
You and me will always roll
I never wanna see
The day that you go
So stoned wow oh!
My love she knows
Together we stand
And they're no turning back
I want you in my life
Will you please be mine

Now when the Night is done and most the people gone home
And you're surrounded by your friends, with them you're never alone
Gather in a circle, fire up a fat cone, 
And if you hit it right, you'll be getting stoned all night long
Favorite song on the radio playin
And you're family's all around you, if you know what I'm sayin
The feelin's tight with lots of smoke in the air
You're just bein yourself, cause good times is true wealth
Now I've been through it all from the thick to the thin
I Fought in many battles, some I did not win
You take the good with the bad, you gotta play what you're delt
And mary's love helps to ease all the pain I felt
So this I dedicate to her, May she one day be free
Free to grow upon this earth, and free to reproduce seeds
Free so all my fellow brethren can breath easily
And free so we can live in peace with unity
