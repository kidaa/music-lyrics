given up the fight I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life find me old postin on my porch
tokin on my pipe I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm
gonna make her my wife

Sometimes I wanna get high travel up away to the beautiful skies
Float away and hope to never come down hope to see the day that I never come down
But what goes up is always bound to fall 
I'll I'm trying to say is that I live my life raw 
I'm gonna smoke week the rest of my life and give all I got till the day that I die.
Ya!

I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life you can find me postin on my porch tokin my
pipe-I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see some people gave in but I ain't given up
the fight I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life find me old postin on my porch tokin on
my pipe I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm gonna
make her my wife

When I look in the mirror I feel so low 
I see my eyes and I feel the glow
I know I can make do let's bless the sole
Show my love and let myself go wow
Everybody knows that I spit these flows and I drink my beer smoke my weed 
But my head's in the clear
Show your love respect the one your dreaming of.

I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life you can find me postin on my porch tokin my
pipe-I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see some people gave in but I ain't given up
the fight I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life find me old postin on my porch tokin on
my pipe I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm gonna

let us plant trees that bear positive fruits that enlighten our minds to the deepest roots all
the way to the core where the soul can stay true  where I can walk free with a joint in my hand
and I can plant plants right upon my land help em' understand these are natures laws my creator
had visions in the things he saw yeah  he saw  yeah my creator had visions in the things he
saw yeah

I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life you can find me postin on my porch tokin my
pipe-I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see some people gave in but I ain't given up
the fight I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life find me old postin on my porch tokin on
my pipe I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm gonna
make her my wife

Now when the love is lost and your spirits are low
The world's closing in around you got no place to go
Done all that you could to ease and please another soul
And in the end you're in the cold, another sad story told
That's why I make my own decisions on how I'm liven
Try to get by with the knowledge that I'm given
Can't make me believe cause a tree is a tree
And when my soul bleeds, the color that I'm spillin' is green

I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life you can find me postin on my porch tokin my
pipe-I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see some people gave in but I ain't given up
the fight I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life find me old postin on my porch tokin on
my pipe I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life see I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm gonna
make her my wife
