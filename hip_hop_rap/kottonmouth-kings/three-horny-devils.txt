Three horny devils on the late night creep
One, two, three horny devils
Kottonmouth Kings rollin' through O.C.
Bass first, then comes the treble
Three horny devils on the late night creep
One, two three horny devils
And if ya feelin'  fool ya betta leave, ya beta leave fool

I'm one of the three of the horniest devils
I'm not Violent J but I'm a psychopathic rebel
Just a bud smokin panty feelin' P-Town kid
Got a 77 slant nose V-dub biatch

Well this is for the bitchez and the bitch boyz too
I'm Saint Dog from that Kottonmouth Krew
Ya sister go inside to drink a 40 oz brew
Gettin' laid in the back of a Subaru
A Subaru, I thought you knew
I did her doggy style like Scooby Doo
Now listen up ladies check it out they call me Saint
I try to be a good guy but the truth it is I ain't
See I huffs on the paint paint
Take rips on the dank dank
And if I'm at a party I might hit the nitrous tank
Fill it up, suck it in wa was to the head wa was to the head
Fill it up, suck it in wa was to the head
D-Loc's got the bud that make your eyes turn red
Its a 9.4 on a Richter scale
I got the green farm buds and they ain't for sale,
The shit we smoke man would never fail us
For the Kottonmouth Kings to inhale, biatch

Three horny devils on the late night creep
One, two, three horny devils
Kottonmouth Kings rollin' through O.C.
Bass first, then comes the treble
Three horny devils on the late night creep
One, two three horny devils
And if ya feelin'  fool ya betta leave, ya betta leave fool

I'm gettin' drunk smokin blunts like these white boys should
They call me crazy crack straight peckerwood
But I'm just a kid walkin' on this earth
And yes I rock the microphone for what its worth
And for what its worth we're all one in the same
Got a little horny devil that controls my brain
Hey hey hey got a bowl, get a light
I beat in the mic some ask for the night
Saint diggy-Dog takin' on oncomers
Winter, spring, and summer I'm burnin' through the rubbers
Burnin' through the rubbers and strippers man
Bet I'll hit more skin than you can
When your high goes flat Pakelika's got the best
Fix you up fill you up with the fat green snacks
Phillies always roll like a wrestlin match
So light it up, go to sleep, Kottonmouth on the creep
Horny devils always huntin always rollin' 3-Deep
Three horny devils three horny devils

Three horny devils on the late night creep
One, two, three horny devils
Kottonmouth Kings rollin' through O.C., three horny devils
Three horny devils on the late night creep,three horny devils

I'm D-Loco, I sip pot cocoa
I wont fuck a girl if the bitch is a broke ho
I'm Saint Doggy drinkin's my hobby,
I'll split yo lip if yo ass gets foggy
I'm X Daddy betcha I have these fine young fillies in my '62 Caddy
Three horny devils psychotic rebels
Rollin' 3-Deep bitch, so turn up yo treble
I was born and bred to rip this 
Takin' 7 bong loads to the mother fuckin head
I'm a late night crawler, P-Town Baller,
Creepin' up on ya like a creepy crawler
haha

One, two three horny devils
Bass first, then comes the treble
O.C. hittin new levels

I'm D-Loc twelve hoochie strollin', phillie blunt rollin',
My bug ain't stolen naw, kinda, not really just some of the parts
Like the end of the rims the bumps and the box
Man I touch a brew but I am hard to reach 1605 down in Huntington Beach
Just to get lit and do another show ya hear bump, bump all night long
I said bump, bump but that's another song and that's another track
So bring it back to the facts of the subject
Fuck it lets fish bowl this bucket
Lets fish bowl this bucket, yea lets fish bowl this bucket
