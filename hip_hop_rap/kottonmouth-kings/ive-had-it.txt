People looking at me staring kind of crazy
Got me wondering what they're thinking maybe
Everything's not fine and if you cross the line
It'll be the last time
I've had it

I get sick of cats staring always looking at me sideways
Ya'll need to mind your fucking business hit the highway
Do it my way worry about your own shit
Think about the next time you got to pay your rent
Put some food upon the table to feed your family
It makes no sense when you got to 
Cause a tragedy
So you break all the rules to make yourself feel okay
Okay then let me do some stupid shit
They ain't gonna know
They ain't gonna tell
Yeah right your dumb ass goes straight to jail
Get caught slipping on some more late night tweaker shit
If you was a head I'd call you a dick
If you was a clit I'd call you a pussy
Okay pussy dick go ahead try and push me
'Cause I'm close to the edge hanging on for my life
And I'll be damned to go out without a fight

[CHORUS]
People looking at me staring kind of crazy
Got me wondering what they're thinking maybe
Everything's not fine and if you cross the line
It'll be the last time
I've had it
'Cause if you keep on pushing I'm a get a little crazy
Get out of my face or there might be trouble maybe
Everything's not fine and if you cross the line 
It'll be the last time
I've had it

So I'm up in the spot and everything's real nice
Drinking a cold ass beer on a hot summer night
Just keeping my cool but this fool he kept staring
Got me thinking to myself soon my drink he will be wearing
What kind of drugs you on that's what I'm asking myself
'Cause mean-mugging one of the Kings yo it's bad for your health
You need to think this one through before you start acting brave 
It's best to walk away now so you can live another day
It seems to me that the position I'm in
They either love me or hate me I got enemies and friends
Don't even really know me but you're jealous as fuck
You need to bounce out quick before my homies get rough
Lay the fucking smack down put you back in your place
I didn't come here to fight I came for a couple drinks
And that's on the real that's all that needs to be said
If you don't kill me then you're dead 
If you don't kill me you're dead...I'm seeing red

[CHORUS]

You think you know me but you don't know me that well...

And part of me still burns like hell
I'm peaceful and irie as I want to be
Just you be you and let me be me
'Cause when you cross the line and threaten family
Then an eye for an eye is all I can see
It's about respect and I expect the same
But all that's just now about to change 

[CHORUS]
