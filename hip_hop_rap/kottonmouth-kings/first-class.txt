It's time to smoke 

Blaze all day, every day 
Each way, the right way 
My way, greenhay, we high 
Been there done that 
Big blunts, fat sacks 
Hit it fast, make it last 
First class, we blaze 

Shit's all finger licking good when you rollin' through the hood 
Twistin Lincoln logs are hard so we burning up the wood 
Cuz I be smokin, drunk, drinking weed and pairing skunk 
I like to smoke a bitch and been known to slap a blunt 
Make the crowd jump, people say them kids got styles 
Renting jewels for your videos you frontin' with that smile 
Acting wild but you ain't even skirt in the pit 
Talking shit, ain't worth a lick 
You wanna bark, then you'll get bit, woof 
Blow the roof off like an atom bomb 
D-Loc to Johnny Richter's like ping to pong 
Ain't nothing wrong, don't fix shit if it ain't broke 
We ain't no jokes, you know the kings by the size of our tokes, 
Motherfuckers 

Blaze all day, every day 
Each way, the right way 
My way, greenhay, we high 
Been there done that 
Big blunts, fat sacks 
Hit it fast, make it last 
First class, we blaze 

My voice is swayin, people always ask me what I'm sayin' 
Playin' shottie for the women, so I'm smooth operating 
Just plain gamin, while you smokin on the hay 
And for the peeps who are working  start your savin' 

I keep it clean shaven, around 4 corners 
We warned ya, no dank is strong enough to hold us 
Like soldiers we fold ya, keep our composure 
Roll you in a joint, light you up and smoke ya 

Only take so much shwag, made me  and gag, 
It's time to smoke some  so i reached in my bag 
Fix my sag as i pulled out my orange zig zags 
You know the Kottonmouth Kings, the worlds' greatest tag 

Team, we gleam, i spit poisonous juice 
Abuse microphones, let my flow run loose 
Calling out all troops, puttin' weight up on the table 
Bring a scale, round by round, check the soundscan 

Damn D-Loc we the cream of the crop, 
DJ Bobby B, Daddy X, and Pak, who locks to beats 
Sportin' high top docs, slangin' pounds of pot 
Take from us, better not 

Blaze all day, every day 
Each way, the right way 
My way, greenhay, we high 
Been there done that 
Big blunts, fat sacks 
Hit it fast, make it last 
First class, we blaze 

I got a knack for bud smoke chronic  
D-Loc's no joke, toke for toke, he'll float your boat 
 down my throat, took off my coat 
Was it wet It was soaked 
Out smoke you Not really, nope 
Sat back and had a coke, relaxed and had a smoke 
A little bit of change, some dank, I was broke 
No dollar stretched out, felt like a stroke 
Brain transformed, like I was on the dose 
Provoke, no coke, I never done roak 
You gotta ring around your nose, take a hit off my roach 
Tryin' to ball like the most, burnt like a piece of toast 
On the coast to coast, deep in the post 
Got my eyes on my crops, watchin' over my gross 
Just daze you a little, damn he's kinda dope 

I see that I might have underestimated him 
You have obviously underestimated my power 

Blaze all day, every day 
Each way, the right way 
My way, greenhay, we high 
Been there done that 
Big blunts, fat sacks 
Hit it fast, make it last 
First class, we blaze
