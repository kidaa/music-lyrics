Some people like to lick it
Others crack a sack, blaze it up and kick it.
Some like to think with a drink their hand
It all depends on the ends that you're willing to spend
I need another lick, I need another lick
what's your trip?
I need another lick, I need another lick
what's your trip?

As I flow let the shit seep deep into your ear drums
Alien fly ass rhymes as you hear them
Peep this sound it's from the darkest side of the planet
A little tab of paper and I'll walk the planet
It's about to happen in the next few hours, 
I've entered a world with billions of flowers
Pixies all dancing all around my head
Chillin' to the melodies of the Grateful Dead
The walls get wavy and melt like gravy
I ask myself is there something here to save me?
Oh, oh, oh shit what the fuck have I done?
A little tab of paper that I put on my tongue.
Now the demons are coming from above and beyond
?? stabbing at my face with their ??
I ask myself is it worth it to lick?
I guess I'm undecided
So fool what's your trip?

I need another rip, I need another rip
What's your trip?
I need another rip, I need another rip
What's your trip?
Some people like to lick it
Others crack a sack, blaze it up and kick it
Some like to think with a drink in their hand
It all depends on that ends that you're willing to spend

Do I lick or do I sip?
None of the above cause I just take rips 
From a pipe, sometimes a bong
Cause it feels damn good when it lingers in my lungs
I'm a ganja man, I like a J in my hand
At all times burning so my high never lands
I'ma get you soooo high, that's what 'I'm sayin
When it comes to smokin, man I'm never playin
Just steady blazin, its amazin how I'm hazin
They never perpetrate and with the highs I'm elevating
And always skating when I get a board
When I bust an ollie my earphones ??
And then I pick it up, and then I smoke it up
And then I smoke it to the head until I'm lifted up
No I cant deny Chinese eyed until the day that I die
I take rips, so bitch what's your trip?

I need another sip, I need another sip
What's your trip?
I need another sip, I need another sip
What's your trip?
Some people like to lick it, 
Others crack a sack blaze it up and kick it
Some like to think with a drink in their hand 
It all depends on the ends that you're willing to spend

You wanna know my trip?
We wanna know your trip
You wanna take a lick?
You wanna take a lick
you wanna take a rip of my trip heres a sin 
Sip sip of some gin now give me your tip.
On point, I need a joint when I'm drinkin
Yes I'm seekin for a 40 to get my buzz peakin
Now I'm leakin all over my self?
What you wanna do, get another 502?
You should have eaten some food 
Instead of drinkin on an empty stomach
Just don't talk cause my buzz is gettin kinda chronic
Bionic, here comes another stage,?
Well this is why I say not to drink while you rage
Head spins, what the fucks goin on?
Head spins, you need to stick to your bong
Well no face first, X clenching on the dirt slang
My head starts spinning I'm about to fall in to the earth?
My mouth starts to water, X says  Puke it out 
Fuck that shit, man that ain't what I'm about
?????????
Pass the malt liquor, gimme another beer
Yo yeah man that's my mother fuckin dog
SAINT DOG
