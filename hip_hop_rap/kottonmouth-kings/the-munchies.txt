I got the munchies im feelin kinda hungry
Im at the grocery fillin up the humvy
These cereal boxes is lookin kinda funny: captain crunch, sugar smacks, and that trix bunny
Its like LOADYland, disney for a stoner
Or viagra for your needy boner
Aisle after aisle I forgot what I came for
The store is closing but I gotta get me more munchies for a big night of kickin it
We bought an ounce an we packin it and rippin it
Richter go fire up the flame pit, grab the acoustic, strung naturalistic
Hot tub yea you know its bubblin, but first I gotta stop my stomach from grumbling
Tasty, all aphrodisiacs, I got the munchies, weres the snack pack

[RICHTER]
BBQ chips, and plenty of refreshments 
Gummy bears, microwavables, mini thinmints 
Ice cream, beef jerky, and candy bars 
Del taco, get a number 4 with no sauce? extra cheese 
Vanilla shakes, sugar outta? pixie sticks
Now and laters, peach jolly ranchers, and buttered popcorn I got the munchies
Chocolates, fizzie? sticks, cookies and otter pops
Reeses cups, tangy taffy, cracker jack box
My stomachs so hungry I need some mad munchies
How many g's we'd smoked nobody ever really believe
Felt like a track meet meet, inhaling smoked heavily,
barely time enough to take an air of breath and breathe
Now in straight cravin a BLT with extra bacon
No onions I don't need my breathe to be stankin
Now for deserts let's see what we got for some options
Dairy Queen, Marie CalendarS, or Baskin Robins
The clerk was cool at the 31 flavors
He let everybody make their own shit and yes he gave us
everything for free 50 free no charge
So we got an 8th of weed and two girlies in his car
Passably stoner Plus my gut was still growlin louder than a pack of coyotes for moon howlin
