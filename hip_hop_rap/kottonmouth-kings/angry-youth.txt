I'm broke with no money trying to make some ends
Thinking about the situation how I'm gonna win
Be at the top of my game and have a little bit of cash
Nice court, nice house, fine wife with an ass

Dipping tripping trying to stay high
Laughing, joking just to get by

In the world day to day, I'm tired
When I feel alive, I'm Livewire
Rub out the fire, of another soul I get higher
And if I had it all my way, today, I'd fuckin' retire
>From the life they created, people chasing ends
Shitting on they friends for a Mercedes Benz
Old rims, New Tims, get caught, life ends, what then? What then!?

What then, what why, what where, what how?
Lets say and flip this whole scipt on ya Now.
Would you still be chasing, paper chasing, making enemies?
Stop just once, think twice, don't front, ugh.

I play to win, stay away from all the bustas
Live my life, people say that I'm a hustler
Just get high, relax what offer could be better, figure it out or you're gonna be screwed
