What are we supposed to be like them what are we supposed to do. 
I gonna live my life.
They way I like
And the way I really want to
I'm gonna always stick my trick no matter how many tries
I gonna go out being remembered
But I'm to young to die

Sub-Noize rat's always up to no good
Were misunderstood no one thought that we could
Everyday a holiday skaten in the street
Runnnin from the police the never let up be
We got, kids' in the suberb kids in the city
The neighbors all hate us because they think we dress filfy
Livin in the fast lane I'm livin for the moment
My times running out and I don't think I could stop it.
Livin' in the gutter wakin up in the streets
They treat us like shit
Like we have a disease

I don't want to be like them go shoppin at the malls
I wanna smoke my weed
Skate all day
And drink beers in my yard.
