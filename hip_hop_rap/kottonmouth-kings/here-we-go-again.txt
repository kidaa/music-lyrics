Each Now who say Dog Boy only come in a reggae fashion 
Hey Mon' say never judge a book by it's cover, turn the page to discover 
You got the reggae on one and the punk rock ragamuffin on the other 
Richter! 

You know it's time to leave my house, so I slid out the door 
Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hits the floor 
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years 
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears 
Took it on the redline then I slapped it in two 
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew 
But now I'm 5-0-2, it ain't the route for me 
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC 

I'ma go to Mickey D's, get a burger with some cheese 
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys 
Capishe , cuz you don't know 
I'll give it to my friend, no, we spilt the door 
Back in the bus we puffs, kept rollin' 
Scoot, Dog Boy, Daddy X is holdin' 
There go the potion, look you're frozen 
Damn this bud's good! 

Here we go again, bump 2000 
Forward the plan, forward, the mission 
Here we go again, bump 2000 

Bump bump, you know how the sound flows 
Bump, bump, yo it's like that you know 
Bump bump, Babylon beware 
We got one microphone for the world to share 

 on the ears of America 
 rock the mic by the lyrical hysteria 
 few selects infiltrates all areas 
 upon the mic, released upon America 

I got a '85 Caddy with the Clarion Amp 
With some 10s in the trunk for punks who wanna bump my shit 
Bang, rattle your chest and brain 
Frame by frame rearrange your shit 
Adjust your amps and your shit might hit 
Don't quit to the beat, the bass gets deeper 
Listen to the tones as they crush your speakers 
With the little bitty thump, 

Well yup I'm still drunk with the humps in the trunk 
You hear the Kottonmouth Kings yellin' out bump bump 
I flew through a yellow, then I ran a red 
Grabbed a bev saw a cop, hit the clutch and revved 
Knew I had to slow down so I smoked a bowl 
Picked up D-Loc and told him start to roll 
Freeway was packed so I paid the toll 
Four joints later my bus was fishbowled 

Here we go again, bump 2000 
Forward the plan, forward the mission 
Here we go again, bump 2000 

Bump bump, you know how the sound flows 
Bump, bump, yo it's like that you know 
Bump bump, Babylon beware 
We got one microphone for the world to share 

 Jamaica island of the songs 
And all you ever hear is the bass and drum 
I said the  
When the rhythm hit, it become anthem 
 have no car, we take many car, mon 
We drive around  ragamuffin 
 trees at the window, now wicked rhythm 
Come along for the ride through Jamaican countryside 

When it come to music, lord we love it 
Any style we can  
Bump 2000, lord here we come again 
First time around we rock all across the land 

How's that sound with the tick and the bump 
I puff the skunk while I'm settin' off alarms 
EQ my mid so my highs don't twitch 
I drop bombs while your sounds blown to shit, 
I like to sip on my binger, ice water rips are cleaner 
Push the bud down with my finger, then I snapped a load 
The bud i got is meaner, felony no misdemeanor 
Got a Beamer same as Zingers, with the system full blown 

Daddy X, correct, who'd you expect 
The man slinging necks on the bottle connects 
What'd you think X is for ecstasy 
Is that why the fuckers standing next to me 
Or is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King, 
With pounds and pounds and pounds of Florida keif 
Nah no thing, smoke ring coinsure 
You'll never find my bong water dirty like the sewer 

Here we go again, bump 2000 
Forward the plan, forward, the mission 
Here we go again, bump 2000 

Bump bump, you know how the sound flows 
Bump, bump, yo it's like that you know 
Bump bump, Babylon beware 
We got one microphone for the world to share
