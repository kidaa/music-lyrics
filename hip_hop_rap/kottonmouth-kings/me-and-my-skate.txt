Oh shit God damn, I almost hit that little punk rock kid.
Oh shit, ah damn, well what's happenin here Damn helicopters
And all I saw was some little skater kid
Come runnin by with a test tube, one of them glass ones.
Oh man, I'll check the news
And find out what the hell's happenin here. "Hola como estas"
Fuckin commercials, damn yeah,
"This is Victoria Secretion reporting live from Orange County California,"
No shit, "where just moments ago, Officer Jack Mehoff and our
chopper in the sky Spotted rapper D-Loc, member of the infamous
Kottonmouth Kommittee,
Skating east bound on Yorba Linda Blvd.
DLoc has been at large and is wanted by press, parents, and
authorities
For being a nusiance to society. Approach with caution,
DLoc could be under the influence of a mind altering substance."

Its me and my skate, skate
In this world of hate and confusion
I sweat all day to create an illusion
Or a fantasy yeah that's what you call it
You can be a bong tokin alcoholic
Well this came true so I grip the mic tightly
And when I'm rocking the stage my skates besides me
After the show you'll catch skating in the parking lot
Bustin grinds and flips, my board is all I got
To escape the realness of reality
I smoke a joint so I can cope with this insanity
They say sobriety's the answer to society
I say its anarchy but they ain't understanding me
I say it twice but they just can't relate
I guess its fate, my boards my mate
Just, just me and my skate

She said "Hi Saint my name's Luana."
Lou wanna wanna wanna take me home
Lou wanna wanna wanna lay and bone
But I get aggravated, mentally frustrated
When I act like cuz your boyfriend player hated.
Left jab, right hook, then I knocked him out,
I hate player haters so I pissed in his mouth.

"Apparently local officials have turned the Kottonmouth Kommitte
case over to the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
The elusive Orange County rappers, under the direction of Pimp
Daddy X are sought in connection with a number of charges
Ranging from obsenity, influencing the minds of minors, fake
ID's, lude and crude behavior, and demoralizing society.
Right wing, religious zealots have apparently threatened to
Quote 'Crucify those young punks.' "

Yo I got a scam for this, you know I got a scam for that
The Daddy's friends are good but still I watch my back
I like to vibe, write a rhyme to a funky phat track
I got the scam to get the green to scam for a fat sack
Too many vices and insane extremities
I got no good solutions, so no quick remedies
Don't wanna slave my life working at a 9 to 5
Fuck flippin burgers don't wanna drop no fries
Don't wanna move boxes, move shit or sit behind a desk
Just wanna get upon a mic and let my skills start to flex
Addicted to the homegrown, fly girls and
I'm not a loser look at you, don't wanna be left alone
Addicted to the nicotine, a full time toker
All the more confused with mi vida loca
Late night toker, indo smokers
Hey hey daddy x, daddy x, daddy x, daddy x
Let your skills flex
Hey hey daddy x daddy x
hey daddy x, put those fools in check
Live while you live you gotta live your life while you're here
Time is all I got I wanna smoke the kind and guzzle beer
Fear of life at times yes but I ain't got no time for that
I gotta kick it chill got to kick it to the max
So when you see daddy x in your vicinity
Pass the pipe, pass the j, say "what's up"
I'm out, peace
Me me me and my skate, my skate, my skate, my skate
My mate my skate
Me me me and my skate, my skate
My skate my mate in this world of hate
