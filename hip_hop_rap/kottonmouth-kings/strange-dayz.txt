Magic mushrooms x-tacy, cannibus, ludes, and GHB uppers n- downers and THC blues
and vics and acid on sheets

[JR:] Hey yo Loc
[D:] What's up Johnny Richter
[JR:] I still sport the same frame, I just changed the big picture
[JR:] Now Im'a sit your ass down right in the front row
[JR:] To let you know how we smoke at a Kottonmouth Kings Show
[D:] You know we do it, did it, doin it again
[D:] I need at least ten tokes for my day to begin
[D:] A big sack of the chronic, cause you know I'm always on it
[D:] Steady smokin out the glass, got the plastic go and pawn it
[JR:] And get a refund check, I bet you sell your mamma's drawls
[JR:] You keep bouncin like my balls off the walls just because
[JR:] You want a piece of what I got plus a sack of my pot
[JR:] Think you're really gonna get it, thought wrong, I think not
[D:] We pulled up at Four Twenty in the old rotation
[D:] Rolled up on the homies, like what you blazin
[JR:] They said some purple kush
[D:] That they got from Riverside
[JR:] But I knew they was fakin, the shit barely got me high

Everything looks the same- but everything feels so differently- and I don't know if its just
all in my head or if I'm losin my sanity- My smokin my drinkin is foggin my thinkin that's what
they all keep tellin me- and faces-n-places keep changin erasin and everything feels so strange
to me

[JR:] Now we out on the road, different city every night
[JR, D:] Different ho's every night, different flows every night
[D:] We stay drunk off Bud Light
[JR:] So fuck the Malt Liquor
[D:] We drink beer by the can, cup, bottle, or pitcher
[JR:] You'll see us onstage faded straight buzzed as fuck
[JR:] You'll hear us bumpin down your block when we're in our trucks
[JR:] - - - - - That's what's up, damn I blew another woofer man that's just my luck
[D:] Well that's your luck, I hope mine's better then that
[D:] As I tilt down my hat, and twist off my beer cap
[JR:] Yeah, Loc's kinda crazy doin 80 in the dirt
[JR:] With his bike in the back and a beer in his lap
[D:] I don't feel the hurt, when it's time I go bizzerk
[D:] Third gear buckled, shit didn't even hurt
[JR:] Well you know I seen the footage, and the film don't lie
[JR:] Knocked the wind out his chest and straight blackened his eye

Everything looks the same- but everything feels so differently- and I don't know if its just
all in my head or if I'm losin my sanity- My smokin my drinkin is foggin my thinkin that's what
they all keep tellin me- and faces-n-places keep changin erasin and everything feels so strange
to me

[D:] I'm feelin so strange with the addition of pills
[D:] Poppin little tiny blue things with no time to kill
[JR:] Eat the mid-sized whites, they'll keep you rollin' till the mornin'
[JR:] Take one with a chick, you know that night you might be bonin'
[JR:] D-Loc
[D:] Whoa .. 
[D:] I'm feelin kind of strange and I'm out of control
[JR:] Ya know the big ol fatties are the Tylenol 3's
[JR:] And the orange ones I got come straight from overseas
[D:] You know how I do it, wakin up everyday
[D:] Drinkin beers in my bed, waitin for a lady to play
[JR:] And I love being on one, two, three, or four
[JR:] Looped, staring at the ceiling with my back on the floor
[D:] five, six, I rolled out with my Dick
[D:] I called this bitch, she was a lil ass trick
[JR:] Now we not saying it's right, but strange is how we're livin
[JR:] Just goin through life having fun with what we're given

Everything looks the same- but everything feels so differently- and I don't know if its just
