You wanna smoke with us you better bring an ounce, 
Cuz we get down with a southern bounce, 
P-Town led the fair where I move the pounds, 
Now I'm coming and runnin' your city unannounced, 
So don't get clowned when we come around, 
We so down to earth that we underground, 
I'm puffin' on the green while you're smokin' shit brown, 
Cuffin' to the team compound lock down, 
I'm aside my krown throwin' strike for the mound, 
Keep it tight wound like two blood hounds, 
I'm gettin' so profound we make the haters frown, 
Got your girl beggin' me to be gagged and bound, 
Make the world spin round so turn it loud, 
That danced out, thumped out, mo thug crowd, 
Started in '96 with the O.C. sound, 
Now we comin' So Cal, 
Now we world renowned,

We can do it live on cable T.V. 
With kings blend dope you choke before you spoke, 
We toke to call your hope and you still can't cope, 
With the bubble berry blue you're through, 
Get your krew tight, shoo get a clue, you belong in the Zoo, 
Yup, swingin' from a rope eatin' cantaloupe, 
Or woke in a boat like a frog and croak, 
Don't get the wrong view, you're all past due, 
We get the oohs and ahhhs while y'all get the boos, 
You won't know how I know cuz I put it to a vote, 
We the greatest smokers that you can quote, 
Quote for quote let me clear my throat, 
Been puffin' kings blend bong load al a mode, 
The neutron bomb, the sticky green, 
I'm higher than a kite when i hit the scene, 
Stoners Reekin Havoc ask Kevin Zing, 
But he'll only reply if it means ching ching,

D double dash Loc I'm from O. C. 
I still can't see when the smoke hits me, 
Startin hittin' each hash  so I can make ends meet, 
Defeat the weak matter of my league, 
I freeze OGs leave me stunned and deceived, 
I'm freakin' this beat while I'm stoned in the street, 
While you down on your knees, beggin' oh please, 
Chillin' in a room hot boxed to the ceilin', 
 the crop cuz we got top billin', 
Feelin' high as fuck so the buds fulfillin', 
Dealin' then healin' never stoner revealin', 
Now my nug buy me E sacks I be killin', 
Ran out of paper started usin' , 
Never caught a cold but I always be illin', 
Spillin' brew with a view from the ruthless villain, 

High as a kite got a real funny feelin', 
Kings blend dope probably worth about a million, 
 lights miracle grow, 
Hydro rock those fans gotta blow, 
Sittin' low pro on the fog soaked dome, 
 to the party  bone, 
Three months later we's all gettin' stoned, 
Fillin' up Southern Cali toker zone, 
Seizin' clones pounds of zones, 
Cannabis Cup we bringin' it home, 
To the Golden State where it belong, 
Kottonmouth king can't bring it home ya'll,
