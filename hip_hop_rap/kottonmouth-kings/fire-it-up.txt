Salu-Mutha Fuckin-Tations
Glad you came i see you got a reputation
Your in for a night full of blunts and beers.
Drinks and pits come on in dont fear.
Now it might get a liltle restless
But we're all family relax dont stress
You best get out your seats and move to the front
When you hear KMK say FIRE IT UP.

Kottonmouth's here smoke that pit
Every single night we get high and dont trip
24-7,365 all around the world we smoke herb world wide
So who got the chronic up in the building
With the buds in my system yo i catch the feeling

D-Loc got a smoke who got a mother fuckin Light

Walk into the party with a old school limp
Float through the party like the good year blimp
Shrimp on the Bar-B marinated in hemp
