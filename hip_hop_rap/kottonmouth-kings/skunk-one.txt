[DADDY X]
Ooh, Ah, Achika 
Pakelika's sparked the blunt in the back of the car 
We rollin 5 deep to the neighborhood bar 
Cars fishbowled now, we didn't get far 
See red lights flash, cops know who we are 
reputation built, superstar bud smokers 
Coppers hittin' quotas for pullin us over 
Once again, let the routine kick in 
Stash in the dash let the games begin 
Piggy wattles over with that shitty grin 
But I'm, cool as ?hurt? I ain't scared of him 
Infact, I laugh, cause Pak's still smokin 
Cop came up fast tapped the glass but it's broken 
Grabbed the handle quick and the door flies open 
Smoke bursts out 
"WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SMOKING?" 
"Skunk One is what we tokin!" 

[Chorus Daddy X 2x]
OOooh Skunk One's in the chamber Skunk One Skunk One 
It's the mind re-arranger Skunk One Skunk One 
Its the make a friend a stranger 
Spin me changer

Gotta get some weed I was runnin out quick. 
I had a couple of rips left a little that was it. 
My sack was getting low, had a little bit a dough. 
Need to go see my bro so I can get some more. 
Straight indica purple that I got from 33rd. 
Gave me couple a pills and a DragonWorks shirt. 
got a new bong, packed it up and hit it. 
"You like it D-Loc?" 
I said "Yeah I'm with it." 
Then I went to the store, grabbed a pack of blunts. 
Went back to my house and I rolled em up. 
Sat on my couch, drank a beer, and got stoned. 
Called this bitch on the phone that I really wanna bone. 
Now I'm all blown and I'm staring at the ceiling. 
The fans going 'round and 'round I'm just 'illin. 
Smoked so much izzie that it got me chillin. 
Ya'll know the name D-Loc! Ya'll know the feelin D-Loc! 

[Chorus Daddy X 2x]
OOooh Skunk One's in the chamber Skunk One Skunk One 
It's the mind re-arranger Skunk One Skunk One

I need a drink quick someones in danger. 
10 footer fulla skunk One in the chamber. 
Now let me explain exactly whats about to happen. 
Theres gonna be yackin, there probably be passin out. 
Were packin nothin but the Pepe Le Pew. 
S-K-U-N-K F U FUCK YOU! 
So if you got the misconception, that we smoke the stress then, 
You should get a lesson like a bitch with a fuck. 
This ain't amateur hour, This is the bong show. 
If you didn't bring the weed then you gots to go. 
So if you got 8 ounces, come on down next contestant. 
Your the next guest to test the best of any sessions.

I don't slang at shows never deal with strangers. 
But I always got a little Skunk One for the chamber.
