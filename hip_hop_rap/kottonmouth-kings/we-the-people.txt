We The People Are United, 
The ones you never look in the eye, 
We The People, The Uninvited, 
The ones that see right through your lies, 

I'm living in peace decease all evil, 
Honesty's the policy it never be equal, 
Sinful people fall down first, 
Disperse my actions they speak louder than my words, 
Observe, learn, it always comes back, 
Like a mouse in a maze you're caught up in a trap, 
Feeling the vibes that you can't escape, 
Intake injection poisonous perfection, 
Calm down, concentrate, I can't relate, 
Loves great when you only got time to tell fate, 
A place to lay, some tape to break, some goods to bake, some babies to make, 
Don't take it for granted, you got one life to live, 
I know you didn't plan it, so you're forgived, 
We were put on this earth to show goddess to the youth, 
Test the planet and speak the truth, 

We's The People Stress Originality, 
They's the people got you down on your knees, 
We's The People Tryin' to Legalize Weed, 
While you digest the bullshit they forcibly feed, 
We's The People Drawing Lines in the Sand, 
A chemical hate poison greed drippin' plant, 
They control they tax they possess this land, 
One nation indivisible united we stand, 
We The People...

Listen carefully to what they be tryin' to tell us, 
Marked up 800 percent what are they tryin' to sell us, 
Propaganda in the can got your hand in the fan, 
I run my own planet live my life rebellious, 
The people propelled us, 
Mary Jane's who compelled us, 
I got fat sack for all the fans who felt us, 
The ones who smelt us, 
And called the police, time to legalize weed, 
Signed the Kottonmouth Kings, 

I got the universal key so I had to unlock it, 
 blown up like sky rockets, 
Anything you can buy I had mad fat pockets, 
 playa haters can't stop it, 
See I got values that are different than you, 
See you bought lies now not so true, 
I keep this beat planted in the deepest of roots, 
 close minds like a broke parachutes,

Get it straight it's a herb not a drug, 
 society's glove, 
Locked up restricted deemed highly addictive, 
Labeled pot heads now we're all afflicted, 
But why cuz we like to get high, 
Expansion of the mind you should give it a try, 
Chocolate Thai, blue thunder, white butterfly, 
Super silver, purple haze, and the northern light, 

Getting major, major, blaze a few times, 
Puffin' on homegrown, King Klick stay stoned...

Hey loco! D-Loc's on the vocal, 
I stepped out my closet pluckin' my hydros, 
I packed a bowl we smoke original flavor, 
Sweet leaf, Kings Blend in the chamber, 

We the people got a right to be pissed! 
The right to say 'Fuck You!' and 'Suck my Dick!' 
The right to say 'I think I've had enough of your shit!' 
The right to walk over and bust a fool in the lip! 
We the people we from the street! 
We know how to low brow, 
We know how to creep, 
We the people got our right to be open 
This is one motherfucker that you won't be controllin'!!
