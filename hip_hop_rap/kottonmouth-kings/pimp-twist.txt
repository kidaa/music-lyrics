That's life, that's the way it goes
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos
Sometimes I can't take no more
Always leaving shows through the back door

What you got D-Toke
Now what you got ST
Teach me how to get my mack to a T
First of all, I put that pimp twist on her
Then I let her know that I'm a P-Town baller
Next thing you know, you see I get no rejection
High in charisma, smooth-ass complexion
I'm Daddy X and I come with correction
You know there's infection, so wear some protection
Ain't nobody slicker than B-Dub on the mixer
Don't bring your girlfriend 'round because he's down to get with her
Fool what you barkin', it must be the liquor
I'm back on your bitch so stick around like a sticker
Naw, but I'm quicker cuz I'm the D-L-O-C
All the freaks know me, they call me Loc Daddy
I rock shit on the daily, your girlfriend she paged me
I bust you in the grill, then go chill with your lady

It's the pimp twist, it's the pimp twist
Yeah, yeah, pimpin ain't easy!

That's life, that's the way it goes
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos
Sometimes I can't take no more
Always leaving shows through the back door

Yo I'm Saint Dub, and known to drink some brandy
I gots the foul whistle cuz it comes in handy
I once knew this bitch by the name of Candy
But he kicked her out because the punani was sandy
Saint Dog kicked her out, Daddy X took her in
Massengil, Summer's Eve, then I sexed her skin
No girlfriend because they're too damn hectic
I only like the ones that are down to get naked
Well Loc knew Candy, I knew that bitch
I took her out once, made her think I'm rich
Romance, slow dance, made her feel great
And at the end of the night I worked that ass like a slave
Loc did you call her I didn't bend a wrist
Fool, I thought you knew it's the fucking pimp twist

It's the pimp twist, it's the pimp twist
Kottonmouth is the crew that the ladies miss
Yes, they down with this, and so they reminisce
About the day they were caught up in the pimp twist

That's life, that's the way it goes
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos
Sometimes I can't take no more
Always leaving shows through the back door

Now P-Town ballers is the name I claim
Been through many cities and it's all the same
I see a freak, I look in her direction
5 minutes later she'll be licking my erection
Now I'm not a cock blocker like you might suppose
Just a game I run on these mother fucking hos
Like I once knew this girl named Vanessa, I undressed her
Last December, or November. Was it September
I'm a stoner reeking havoc, I don't remember, shit!

Hold your seat
Let me take you to another plateau
Exhilaration of your mind comes with my flow
Really though, I'll let you know I'm that boy ST
Exposing your mind to the rhymes of a P-Town baller
I'll make your girl holler my name in pain as I proceed to call her
My versatile machine on my new found lady
Hit it once and she'll be down to pay me
No babies cuz I elect to protect
From that HIV shit if my dick gets erect, so check
After I'm through, it's out the door, I thought you knew
I'm a P-Town Baller, fool I gotta tell the crew

It's the pimp twist, it's the pimp twist
Kottonmouth make a sweet girl turn a trick
And yes, she's down with this, and so she'll reminisce
About the days she was caught up in the pimp twist

Perpetrator Naw, educator
Playa hata More like a generator
Hesitater Naw, demonstrator
Masturbator Naw, masticator on you old lady's twat
The shit was hot, the pussy got got, I hit the G-spot
My other buddy ate it, his tongue got rot
But he knew what he was in for when the booze got bought
Now that's not a lot but that's food for thought
You gotta bur up if she's hot to trot
Like it or not you need to smoke more pot
And think about your problems, connect the dots

That's life, that's the way it goes
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos
Sometimes I can't take no more
Always leaving shows through the back door
With the dirty ho, through the back door
Took the little skeezy to the mo-mo
And now it's oh no about the info
Gotta keep the shit on the down low
On the down low, about the info
Gotta keep the shit on the down low
