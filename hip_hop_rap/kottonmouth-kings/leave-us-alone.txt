I'm Hip-hop by definition. 
[DADDY X]
Punk rock runs through my veins. 
[LOC] 
I stepped on many stages. 
[DADDY X]
Puffed on many strains. 
[LOC]
Ask me any question. 
[DADDY X]
This song remains the same. 
[LOC]
Kottonmouth Kings is neverending. 
[DADDY X]
Bitch you know the name. 
[LOC]
Let's go! 

[Chorus]
[3x] Whoahhoooahh 

[ALL]
Why can't we just get along? 
[DADDY X]
All these security guards. 
[LOC]
Runnin' round shows always actin' hard. 
[DADDY X]
Why can't, we get along? 
[LOC]
Party all night 'till the break of dawn. 
[DADDY X]
Why don't, you leave us alone? 
[LOC]
Why don't you just leave us alone? 
[DADDY X]
Why can't, we have a good time?

[SKY BLUE]
Leave us alone tough guy! 
Let us have fun tough guy! 
I'll kick your ass! 

[RICHTER]
Actin' like you're a cop, but you ain't got no badge. 
Tryin' to take my pot, then you're getting' a toe tag. 
Searchin' peoples' pockets actin' like a true jake. 
I can see you buyin' steroids with your minimum wage. 

[LOC]
A-Hole boy, yeah you in the yellow shirt. 
Actin' all tough, but you're really just a nerd. 
You don't get paid; you're not superman. 
The money that you make it's to lend a helpin' hand. 

[DADDY X]
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me sir. 
I paid twenty bucks to get in here now my vision is blurred, 
from that bass now this joker is just lookin' disturbed. 
These are extreme actions just for smokin' some herb. 

[RICHTER]
No she don't got a wristband but she's with me. Richter! 
I'm in the Kottonmouth Kings, so excuse me please. 
Now don't make a scene you might lose your job. 
If you had any education you'd just smile and nod. 
Right this way sir. 

[LOC]
Why you tryin' to act hard you really pillow soft. 
You can meet me in the parkin' lot we could straight up box. 
You know you're bigger than me, but size don't matter. 
I'm from the old school fool bitch ass get popped! 

[DADDY X]
We came in piece to celebrate, 
Get high and demonstrate, 
You keep spreading lots of hate. 
Kickin' ass and takin' names. 
Why, you actin' like a macho asshole? 
Beatin' on a kid man he's 15 years old chill! 
chill chill chill 

[SKY BLUE]
Tough guy! 
Leave us alone! 
I'll kick your ass! 
Tough guy! 
Anyone in the pit, up! 

[DADDY X]
Bitch you know the name!

Let's go!
