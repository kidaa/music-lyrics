Voices whisper clear, "Smoke another ST."

3,4 can I stand and handle 1 more.
I'm in the sky am I knockin on heavens door
Now I'm loading up the clip and I'm pullin through, I
see the little black hole that says I missed you.
I can feel the expansion in my chest, I let go
I'm stress free there's no worries left.
my mind travels and my eyes gloss, I reminisce
about the days I hung with big hoss. An even though
he's locked down many still knows that
Saint Dog's got love for his big bro.
Going, going gone, that's it just blazed my last sack.
Case to the head so I can see black. So yo,
that's that, pack me another rip so I can lay back and
let my mind start to trip.
Why me Dloc, call me stoner of the krew. If you
fuckin with my stash then I'm fuckin with you. Saint

Now MaryJane, she's my girl, nowdays seems like the
bitch rules my world. And everytime our lips meet,
she's got me loungin like a leaf on a bud tree.
You know I like to stay high. I got the old school ride.
77' bug and it's white on the outside. But on the
inside it's full of bitches, and ounce of erb and 17
switches.
Who's that drunk that slurs and spits "Saint!" Who
gets trashed and likes to talk some shit"Saint!" Get
me on the skate and I bosut a heelflip, speak with
dirt slang and I just can't quit.
