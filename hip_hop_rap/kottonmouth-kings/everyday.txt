[This one's dedicated, to the big LT and the reality of life]

Take a moment smoke a bowl, let's talk about life What's that
Simply reality of life, now death to the motherfucker that causes strife
R.I.P. Uncle Roy God bless your wife, R.I.P. Uncle Mark God bless your wife
I guess we can't call em in this life of the strife
Now my pops was there when Uncle Roy got buried
So my pops was there when Sheila got married
Represent for his brother AKA best friend
I was there for myself and Big Hoss in the pen
In this life of sin it takes me gin to get by, no lie,
I steady blaze and forever stay high
Don't try to understand it, this life you can't plan it
Just don't take it for granted

Life, to live while you live
Death, to give what you get
Pain, the reality of change
I wonder whether, things will ever get better

Everday, there's more pain that comes my way
And so I pray, the lord to take me away
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me

I picture life as a dream here today gone tomorrow
Love equals hollow, hate equals sorrow
Now follow the real as I take you to a field in my mind where I journey
Sucker bitches can't burn me, bring an attorney
Cuz since child birth I've been raised to do dirt on this earth, yes it hurts
To find out that i can't get away from all the pressures and pain
And misfortunes that I've gained straight
Sometimes a fire grows inside, hatred starts to rise,
Still i can't despise all the lies I've been told, the secrets they hold
The government control, man fuck five-O
So I say, keep your faith in the J, Saint Dog and great smokes a pack a day
Keep your faith in the J, every day I pray
Keep your faith in the J, man pass it this way..

Everday, there's more pain that comes my way
And so I pray, the lord to take me away
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me
