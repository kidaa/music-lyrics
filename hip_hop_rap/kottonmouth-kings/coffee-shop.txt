We love it in the palace when we smokin' off the chalice, 
Quiet as a mouse on the couch we sit, 
Fillin' the pouch eatin' sour patch kids, 

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll, 
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll, 
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely, 
Amsterdam a place called home, 

Thirty-eight strands we through em on the table, 
Sampled em all one by one I was able, 
They all taste good, defeated to smoke, 
Next the two footer, I wanted to choke, 

First morning over seas I'm up a quarter to seven, 
Wakin' up on a boat a floatin' tokers' heaven, 
I head to the future to where I got the future roller, 
A hash  with a special loader, 
Hey yo, roll up the chiva, the paper the comb, 
Insert the filter, head rush, mind blown, 
I call it bluff if the herb ain't quality, 
I'm hunting for the dankiest buds in the country, 
Well I dismissed all rookies with the keyfast cookies, 
And I head to redlight just to get a little lookie, 
Hit the green house, too crowded, 
Just checked out the entry, 
Smoked so much weed I got the highest in the century,

I'm in the mellow yellow, hello, hello, 
Smokin' double purple just me an my girl, 
Richter shows up ready to puff, 
We start smokin' snuff, don't bluff no more skunk, 
The PT Bump the last of the bunch, 
The dirty dirty smoke, we all passed the hump, 
I'm all up in my high so I played a little pinball, 
Gave my girl a kiss we jump like pitfall, 
Ding ding to another level, 
Higher, getting higher, we sat down at the table, 
Breakin' up strands got mad amounts of herbs, 
Observe my headache kid i was high as a blimp kid, 
Now I'm Johnny Richter never say that I'm done, 
Smokin' vaps all day I got that golden lung, 
Blunts and backs 40 sacks  pipe to his bong, 
I even saw a po po puff a bowl from a gun,

Why does everybody keep on planting bud seeds, 
It's obvious to me that it's fulfilling some need, 
A plant is a power like a human is a being, 
Put the seed in fertile soil then continue to feed, 
Whoa! Sit back and watch it grow, 
The miracle of life is so beautiful, 
Don't ever let them tell you mother nature is a bitch, 
Love and restrict only benefit the rich, 

Loaded with hash eight-teen is the winner, 
You get the picture I started to shiver, 
I'm as high as can be with my girl and weed, 
I'm insistology overseas stay high, 
John Rastafari handles my business, 
Licorice sticks at a flick of the wrist, 
Coffee Shop stop but some mocha and some crop, 
Amsterdam where they legalize pot, 
Yo Coffee Shop stop this daze my last strange, 
Slapped on my shades as I step into the rain, 
Try to regain up your  and refrain, 
Johnny Richter's playin' games, 
High as fuck ridin' trains took a plane to the cup  cannabis, 
You know it got me so lit I forgot what song is this, 
I'll never miss another year you know I wish you were here, 
Heinekens all day and grips of krypt with my beer, 

I'm on a paid vacation, 
Smokin' purple silver hazin', 
The back of the cad '82, rippin' out the pap, 
The herb makes me wiser and quality taste smoked out the whole place,
