Full speed ahead never slow my roll lightin J's as I pass your Hi-way patrol  
On the sidewalk spittin as the cop drive by- 
piggy starin at me like I'm supposed to blink an eye  
I don't fear other men other men fear me  
I don't believe in your ignorant hypocrisy 
I don't need you to judge me or read me my rights 
tough cops on bikes no gay men in tights

A little bit of love
A little bit of fear
A little bit of everybody's mouth in my ear
I aint listen to you because I do what I do
And if you got some bud's 
I'm a smoke then to
You betta back the hell up a give Loc some space
And quite the bullshit you're yellin in my face
I got one life to live and I'm goin out smoking
So fuck what you say and the people that are chosen

Livin in fear fear of their cops fear of their jails fear of their laws 
livin in fear fear of their plan fear of their guns fear of there hand- 
Livin in fear fear of their hate fear of their boots night sticks-n-mace 
Fear of their power ignorance and greed 
fear of their laws and the hate they breed- Fear Not

This is a unified session built for world wide tokin I
may stay bent true but I'm not broken  
you silence me see cuz I'm out spoken  
your sleep walkin now I'm awokin  
ask D-loc If you think I'm jokin  
D-loc stays blazed everyday I'm tokin 
so if money can't be eaten  and freedom can't be bought 
you speak of free thinkin they'll incarcerate your thought 
so give me the right to speak and I'm a take it 
give me a mold to break and I'm a break it 
true to myself I stay I can't fake it 
put the pot in the brownie mix and then bake it

Livin in fear fear of their cops fear of their jails fear of their laws 
livin in fear fear of their plan fear of their guns fear of there hand- 
Livin in fear fear of their hate fear of their boots night sticks-n-mace 
Fear of their power ignorance and greed 
fear of their laws and the hate they breed- Fear Not

You want me to be scarred, prepare to be let down
I'm standing strong on my ground, still reppin' P-town
Ridin' round in my crown, the cops see me and frown
And they be acting like clowns, pulling me over for my sounds
Fuckin hassling me with their authority
With their badge, fucking fags, illegal search and siege
Found a little bit of weed, now I gotta pay a fee
When I can smoke in the streets is when I'll really be free

Livin in fear fear of their cops fear of their jails fear of their laws 
livin in fear fear of their plan fear of their guns fear of there hand- 
Livin in fear fear of their hate fear of their boots night sticks-n-mace 
Fear of their power ignorance and greed 
fear of their laws and the hate they breed- Fear Not
