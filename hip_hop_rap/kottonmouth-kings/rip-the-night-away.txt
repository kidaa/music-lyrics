If it ain't natural, then it ain't real

Ohh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Ohh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away

If this was the last joint, that we ever rolled up tight,
I'd want to be with good friends, underneath that open sky,
Play some mellow music, throw our dreams into the fire,
Release all the demons, and our souls are uprising

Oh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Oh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away
Oh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Oh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away

There's nothing in the world like some good times and good vibes
Surrounded with your friends and your family by your side
All the time you spent together going out havin' fun
Doin' the things you do, this life style's got us on the run
Life's too precious every moment make it count
Some days you're on the top some day's you're down and out
This life's a gift, I'm gonna shine my light
So sit back, relax, get high, with us and kick it with us tonight

Oh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Oh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away
Oh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Oh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away

Rip the night away
Burning, burning, burning
Rip the night away
Burning, burning, burning
Rip the night away
Burning, the night away

Take me to the mountain high, where I can smoke a bowl in peace while I drive
I'm on a
Back road with my sunroof open, on the way to meet the friends, we'll gather and tokin', and we
Build a fire and chill for the night, catch up on old times and roll a few, what I like we just,
Sit there, fire and reminisce 'bout the best days of our lives and we be the ones blazin'

Oh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Oh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away
Oh we gon' be kickin' tonight
We gon' be sipping tonight
Ripping the night away rip the night away
Oh, when the time is right
Another full moon light
We rip the night away rip the night away
