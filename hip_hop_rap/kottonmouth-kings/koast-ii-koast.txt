[CHORUS]
We met a lot of scratch
X we made a lot of dough
We always rolling grass
Loc we smoked a lot of 'dro
We wrote a lot of songs
X we played a lot of shows
We packed a lot of bongs
Man we flipped a lot of hoes
We did a lot of this
I know we did a lot of that
We traveled lots of miles put the styles on the map
We recognized world wide if you didn't know
We flow with the clouds rolling out Koast II Koast 

Now I know you never seen somebody like me
Up on the stage ripping the M-I-C
With so much ease clearly
Time for you the parents gonna tell their peers
That their sons and daughters are filled with beers 
Now their sons and daughters are filled with fears
Because lights and sirens are getting near
See I recall one night in Omaha
We was getting' drunk all having a party ya'll
At a house where they had a party ball
At the end of the night I could hardly walk at all
Said fuck that and I started to crawl
Was in the backyard but I started to fall 
On the ground like I was a basketball
Up and down like a fucking see saw
I remember getting' baked up in the great lakes
Trying to make hash and weed cakes
Then it got so late with bus call at eight
Had to bounce out quick catch a break
Trek down to the southern states to the dirty south
Where the girlies shake their asses 
To get some backstage passes man I love my life

[CHORUS]

I remember one time we was out in the Carolina's
A group of hippies came up on us saying they was trying to find us
They heard about us in High Times you know the magazine
They said it's groovy what we're doing for the cannabis scene
They put a box in my hand it weighed at least two pounds
And it was custom painted decorated with a Krown
I opened up the box and smelled the sweet aroma
We had a massive session almost left X in a coma
Now that's the type of love the Kings are getting Koast II Koast
You know we chilly most always going out for broke
We put that Southern California life style on them
And make them freedom songs that make you want to rip your bong

[CHORUS]

Now you need to simply understand
Kottonmouth Kings roam all over this land
And we rolling until the wheels fall off
Stoners reeking havoc we ain't never gonna stop
Break 'em off Loc

I'm flowing now Koast II Koast
On the gas we be dipping through the map
Smoking buds in the back of the bus rolling blunts
Represent with the raps steady moving on the dip
Microphone on my hip let me tell you all like this
I was drinking like a fish one night I recall
Getting faded off that eight ball
Taking mushrooms tripping thought I was on the moon
Hey yo Mike stop the beat because I got to go to the bathroom

[CHORUS]

You can always catch the Kottonmouth Kings
Rollin' on the interstate highways
Through the deserts to the mountains to the shining sea
From the East coast to the West Coast
To the Midwest to the high plains
The Rocky Mountains 
The dirty dirty South
You know the Kottonmouth Kings are still blowing smoke rings
Sub Noize family going Koast II Koast
Where you at
