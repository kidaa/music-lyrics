I snapped a load, watch it glow, glow, glow 
Looks so fruity sittin' in my bowl 
Thanks to Mary, Jane is my bro 
Glow baby, glow baby, grow baby, glow 

If you ask me how I'm living, my reply is 'I'm sold' 
Smoked out, without a doubt 
I keep a constant flow, of indo smoke pouring out my lungs 
And you can strip to find a stash on the tip of my tongue 
Marijuana, running through my veins 
God's great gift comes in different strains 
From the mainland purps all the way to big island 
Underground cultivation, yes I try to stay blasted 
From to sea to sea, and I've also been known to plant seed after seed 
Seven points on my flag when it's blowing in the wind 
Prop 215 so let the games begin 
Smoke as much as you want, Johnny Richter's everlastin 
When you packin' a sacks,  
Your plants don't grow in that bud that be glowin 
For once you have to ask, all the people never knowin

Yo, I can barely breathe, I need to kick a verse 
The smoke's on my mind, and it's getting on my nerves 
Observe, don't wanna look at my lungs 
Shriveled like an old peach, pear, plum 
Nicotine, I'd rather smoke some green 
What does it take, and why do I fiend 
If I conquer this kick, I'd be crowned king 
Wasting my money, four bucks a pack 
Going out of my way for some dirt sticks at that 
It's gettin to be crap, I'm all up out of wack 
But I'm rowdy, I need to buy a patch 
The dirty little camel is makin' me weeze 
Go around to the castle where there's bongs and weed 
I need to take a shit, got no time to think 
There's a zong by the toilet, and some bud on the sink 
Some bud on the sink, some bud on the sink 

I snapped a load, watch it glow, glow, glow

I knew a real stoner named D-Loc 
Never went to sleep, smoked weed till the sun broke 
Up all night with his pipe, puffin' indo 
Evaporated herb, like delapidating ozone 
Sack after sack, after sack, now he's flat broke 
About to get faded, take a toke, while the tape rolls 
Kottonmouth Kings write rhymes on hemp stones 
Daddy X don't smoke, and  
Save the best of the best, when pack it in the vest 
You know the THC content you will never guess 
Unless you invest, we can put it to the test 
There's no stress for the cess, we all about the next guest 
, now our minds spun, 
We in a whole new place, lowered the lights 
Bud stickin, laced, fruit taste, sticky 
Nothing but dank, number one rank 
No need to rush, sippin' buds by the crops 
Those little red rocks in the hydroponic box 
To keep the plants kissin, we got a drip system 
Electronical device, liquid dice 
 to the fullest and beautiful kolas 
One puff, you clueless, to all you rookie smokers 
 was stun, relation was won 
We love to see our plants looki' pretty in the sun
