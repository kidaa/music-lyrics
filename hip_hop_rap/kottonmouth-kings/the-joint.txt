Yo, you gots the joint 
Nah, I got the joint 
Yo, who's got the joint 
We all got the joint 
We all on point, we all on point 
Yo, you gots the Joint 
Nah, I got the joint 

Where and when, it probably fell out your ear 
I'ma look behind the couch, finding all kinds of shit 
Hair pins, erasers, crumbled up pieces of paper 
Broken pagers, and a half pack of grits 
Cuz I slipped on my floor walking up the stairs 
Could still be camouflaged, hidin' in my hair 
Behind my ear nestled in the back, but it ain't 
I know because I checked, I'm still searchin' for the dank 
You probably threw it out with your old pack of cigarettes 
Look in the trash can, your as high as you get 
Sometimes you forget, smokin' one to many hits 
About to look in my caddy, down the walkway bricks 

I jumped out the screen door, mac light in hand 
Searchin' down the sidewalk, leadin' to my van 
I hit the alarm and the door just slides 
I check from front to back and side to side 
Then I let the Alpine play 
Got the 6 disc changer, read-out display, 
Called my boy Dave, who gets paid to skate 
Bling, hello, I think it fell by your gate 
Well it's not in my van, so I checked my jeep 
Limited edition 4x4 with leather seats 
Looked in the ashtray and only found a roach 
I was so fuckin' high I forgot that we had smoked 

Yo, you gots the joint 
Nah, I got the joint 
Yo, who's got the joint 
We all got the joint 
We all on point, we all on point 
Yo, you gots the Joint 
Nah, I got the joint 

I got the joint, but you ain't gonna smoke it 
Come around get cloudy, it disappeared like hokus pokus 
King klick tokas, royalty smokers 
Come around it disappears like hokus pokus 
I'm gettin' amped up, in different states of mind 
I hit a depth for a track as I prepare my rhyme, 
Sometimes I'm real high, besides I don't lie 
Look at all these phony people tryin to make supply 
Yeah, you sly in your flashy suits 
You sellouts get the fuck outta here, bail out 
I sag my jeans, rock hemp and  
I got a 85 caddy, give a fuck about the billboard 
You live at large with your three car garage 
Your Ferrari, BM, and Lamborgini coutures 
I smoke hard, blow large, keep you guessin 
Up in the treehouse, like a bird, nestin 
Loungin, you'll be amazed how I'm steppin 
It's a blessin, lookin' over my ground 
Eyes like a owl head, rotates around 
360 degrees in a circle 

Yo, you gots the joint 
Nah, I got the joint 
Yo, who's got the joint 
We all got the joint 
We all on point, we all on point 
Yo, you gots the Joint 
Nah, I got the joint 

Yo I got the joint and it's rolled with precision 
Precisely sliced in the ends, surgical incisions 
It's like religion, my blunt rollin' routine 
It's a process, and yet it comes guaranteed, by me by who 
Motherfuckin' Johnny Richter 
If you lay on the work then call me Johnny the evictor 
To play with my money is to play with my emotions 
Like tokens in Vegas, your ass is cash 
I got incredible dank, as it lingers out the chamber 
Mind blowin smoke, unbelievable taste 
Jack frost have you lost, seeing stars in space 
Laced up to the moon, Pluto, then Neptune 
The earth is greenest, smokin' bong loads in Venus 
The rings of Saturn gettin' lost in space 
Homebase it the place we blaze the most weed 
I gots the joint is the bomb ass  

Yo, you gots the joint 
Nah, I got the joint 
Yo, who's got the joint 
We all got the joint 
We all on point, we all on point 
Yo, you gots the Joint 
Nah, I got the joint 

Just a player with the big hair, baby  five 
Still bumpin, getting high, constantly red eyed 
12-28, full of bitches inside 
1605, where the homies reside 
We fly, first class, with the  
Rockin' vertebrae  wallet chains on their hips 
Saggin' jeans, DCs, pocket full of weed 
I got what you want, tell me what you need 
And I'll proceed to bust out the pounds and break em down 
Got connection to PC, Cali, and Chi-Town 
Whether up north, down south, or the inbetween 
Red, purple, orange, or the lizard green 
I got the joint but you ain't gonna smoke it 
Come around, get cloudy, it disappeared like hokus pokus 
King klick tokas, royalty smokers 
Come around, it disappears like hokus pokus 

Yo, who's that peepin' in my window 
Hope it's not a po-po 
Cuz then they gonna see my crops 

I got the joint but you ain't gonna smoke it 
Come around, get cloudy, it disappeared like hokus pokus 
King klick tokas, royalty smokers 
Come around, it disappears like hokus pokus 

Back wall hydroponic system, stealthy position 
With couple thousand watts 
I got the joint but you ain't gonna smoke it 
Come around, get cloudy, it disappeared like hokus pokus 
King klick tokas, royalty smokers 
Come around, it disappears like hokus pokus
