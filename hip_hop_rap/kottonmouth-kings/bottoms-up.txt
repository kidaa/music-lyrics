That's about a blunt bitch to be in the ghetto,
Motherfuckers you see hangin around liquor stores 
Turn that shit up like nothing
That Sisqo and shit, y'know that O that O.E.

The bullet, the bull drop, turn that shit up
You liein? Early in the morning turn that shit up
BOTTOMS UP

Crunk [X5]

Getting high getting loose and get crunk
Bottoms Up we gonna make that shit bump
Everybody in the place come on jump jump

[Daddy X]
Its me friends Daddy X again,
Roll a fat joint, crack a Heineken,
I'm in the back room havin sex again
Ooh not again

Bottoms Up y'all raise your shot glasses
Shake your asses ladies let it hang out
Gotta get down show em what you all about
We came to raise hell,

Last Call

We takin over throwin out security,
Bottoms up whats up whos with me

[Chorus]

[Richter]
My drinks done, my glass is empty
1,2,3 shots now im feelin friendly
whats up ladies
You wanna tempt me, I love a challenge
I been known to drink liquor till I lose my balance
We getting drunk, drunk
We after crunk, crunk
We smoking skunk, skunk
We know what you want, want
The sticky shit that you only see in pictures,
The old G heads know it comes from Johnny Richter
Our reputation well it speaks for itself,
If you want the bomb shit you better come with some wealth
All I got is green crack, cush and skunk 1
Im in a super, super haze in a dumpster son
So pack a bowl if you wanna get high,
Shit pack 5 go ahead heres my pipe,
Fill it up right so it hits her clean
It's the weapon goin out to watch
Tell her what I mean

[Chorus]

White boys do that shit, 
You throwin that shit down,
That beer and shit
12 pack, 48, 24's 48 
White guys drink a lot of fuckin beer
God Damn

[D-Loc]
Get crunk, crunk yeah,
Get crunk get crunk yeah

He said roll a blunt 
He said get crunk

We getting drunk rockin mikes doin things that you wouldn't believe
Hey yo you need to pass the weed
Every day and every night
Hey yo mike stop the beat cuz I forgot my rhyme
Fuck where'd I put that shit
Hey Patrick have you seen my book

I need to take another rip, I need to smoke another cig

Cuz you cant deny that I move the crowd
Bottoms Up motherfuckers we 10 years deep
