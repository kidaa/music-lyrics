We'll probably waste away and pay this price for livin

Yeah I'ma waste away my life cause I really don't care
Jump every bump in my truck, all tires in the air
Accepting every dare, leap off a cliff, fuck yeah
And if you wanna get em up, I hope you're commin prepared
Cause I ain't backin down from shit, I'm a pit in a dog fight
Ear's snipped, smellin blood, and my jaws is clamp tight
Around your neck, I'm 'bout to wreck shop, fuck you and your pops
And if the cops get involved, then they gonna get dropped
Stay the fuck out of my business, just leave me alone
I live my life how I want, when I want, I'm full grown
And I'm gettin fed up with all these rules and regulations
Sixty-five on the highway, nope I'd rather be racin'
So fuck the population, fuck the laws they creatin' 
I feel it's an invasion to get arrested for blazin'
I feel it's time to give up, start livin how I want
Cause in the blink of an eye, you're whole life could be gone

We'll probably waste away and pay this price for livin- Your probably gonna miss us when were
dead and were gone- We don't see yesterday tomorrows in our vision we take it to the limit and
we keep movin on Pushin Limits

I goin all out until my dyin day 
I don't care the police give a fuck what they say
I'm stayin blazed everyday all day
Doin my thing braken
Law's I don't a bay
Theirs no turning back
And their not gonna stop me
I stay stealth like armed robberies 
When you play the game
You gotta be prepared
You can't be afraid
You can't be scared
To throw your fist in they air
And gett'em up on sight
Size don't matter
It's the facted that you fight
You get respected on top or the bottom
Even if you get knocked out
Or your clocken
Get the hell on
Stay out my matha fuckin face
I'm down for my shit
D-Loc don't play
I got one thing to say
Weather you like it or not I do what I do.

We'll probably waste away and pay this price for livin- Your probably gonna miss us when were
dead and were gone- We don't see yesterday tomorrows in our vision we take it to the limit and
we keep movin on Pushin Limits

I wanna get faded tonight lit with my crew blitzed stoned and puke eat me some shrooms spit on
a cop tell him fuck you  get my dick sucked fuck on the roof  blow all my cash and just do
what I do

We'll probably waste away and pay this price for livin- Your probably gonna miss us when were
dead and were gone- We don't see yesterday tomorrows in our vision we take it to the limit and
we keep movin on Pushin Limits
