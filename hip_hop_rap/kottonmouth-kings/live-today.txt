Feet, I was fresh dressed like a million bucks, saggin in my ten dicks with a tear on my nuts,

Believe, I can do anything, don't accept defeat, I'm just tryin to get by while smokin on some
Trees

Got til the fruit is ripe, pick up the pen, uplifting in sight, the weakest link my be the one
In the light, you gotta stay true, stay strong, hold tight, this is Daddy-X, and I'm rick rick

Wake up everyday and I wash my face, and I look in the mirror, deep inside I gaze, into my
Eyes, check the vis, feel out what I'm gonna do, cause the skys the limit, whether me or you
