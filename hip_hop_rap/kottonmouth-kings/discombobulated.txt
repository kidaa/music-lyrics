Watch it, watch it, watch it
Dog Boy here, and I'm singing with the Kings
Cool and delayed?
Sing it, comin' comin'

I be getting faded, discombobulated
Never say I made it till I'm pissin' off the top
O.C. playas, fly rhyme sayers,
Haters can't fade us cuz it's true hip-hop

MC'in is the place for me to be in, 
And nut-swinging is the way that I be g'in
Never leanin' to the old, for the lyrical hold, 
Keep my shit bold, more ?? I stole?
Fuck parol when I stroll, man I dodge five-0
I dip-dive, fuck a bribe, live to rock the show and the ho
Skip the blow, gimme the 40, yo
I like a lady down to ride it like a rodeo
You see anarchy on the ?? like a hippie?
??? cuz my head's a little trippy
My bud's I like 'em sticky, so pack another rip, D
High as the plains west of the Mississippi

I be getting faded, discombobulated
Never say I made it till I'm pissin' off the top
O.C. playas, fly rhyme sayers, 
Haters can't fade us cuz it's true hip-hop

Eh rude boy, lad you party nonstop, 
You're the first to start, you're the last to drop
Eh rude boy, you never fear the cops cuz music is our weapon 
And that them can't stop

Punk rock man, let me tell my thoughts of Hoss
Hip hop freestyle, freedom of course
Ooh, my old girl Mary better known as a swag-hag
Every other night she had me out buying dime bags
A dime to a twenty, to a forty, to an eighty
I switched to homegrown now I puff at Bobby B's, y'all

I be getting faded, discombobulated
Never say I made it till I'm pissin' off the top
O.C. playas, fly rhyme sayers, 
They just can't fade us cuz it's true hip-hop

Eh rude boy, lad you party nonstop, 
You're the first to start, you're the last to drop
Eh rude boy, you never fear the cops cuz music is our weapon 
And that them can't stop

Check your traits, you perpetrate I can't relate
Your mental mind state is far to overrate, you can't skate
Don't sit and debate, you need to skip the ??, 
Ask Jesus Christ to clean the slate
I think it's fate, I ain't done yet so wait
Your philosophies- pale and underweight, they're out of date 
One mo' thing, and then we're straight, put the fake to sleep 
And then I catch you at the wake
And then we'll bake, and once again try to relate
Hopefully the good will win, you'll lose the hate
That's a close, I think we''re up to date
Wake up young chump, get a grip, checkmate

Sound boy, you should've thanked the Saint
He just saved your life from a terrible thing
Sound boy, Saint just put you in check, 
He set you straight to save your own neck

I be getting faded, discombobulated
Never say I made it till I'm pissin' off the top
O.C. playas, fly rhyme sayers, 
They just can't fade us cuz it's true hip-hop

Oh, Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy
Singing with the Kings up on the record version
Eh rude boy, I say you party nonstop, 
You're the first to start, you're the last to drop
Eh rude boy, you never fear the cops cuz music is our weapon
And that them can't stop
Shucka shucka to all the rude boys, 
Shucka shucka to Suburban Noize
Coming in unity, like one big family, 
Every ?? gonna make you feel so irie
It's Dog Boy, you know me chat nonstop,
Seeking the roots rub-a-dub, ragamuffin punk rock
It's Dog Boy, kickin down your shit 
From your microphone, ear, to your consolate
Like the black flag son we're gonna rise above, 
Every time we're coming with respect and love
I am the one Dog-Boy from L.A., CA 
In the name of unity I ?? must say
From London, to Kingston, from the South Bay, 
All me out to do is flash my stylee
Now I am a-comin' and I'm ??, little sound boy with no solution
Check the bag?, with just one flow
You may find you don't need a ego
It's Dog Boy, you know me chat nonstop 
With the roots rub-a-dub, ragamuffin punk rock
Eh rude boy, you never fear the cops, music is our weapon 
And that them can't stop
