Fire....It....Up

[D-LOC]

As the plot continues to get thicker
We move onto another chapter
We gettin wiser and older 
But there's still more to capture
I can still remember when we weren't even a band
Then we all got together figured out we can conquer this land
Our dreams became reality we're still here 10 years later
Bigger, faster, stronger, better
Bring it to the table we come swingin on whatever
Daddy X, D-LOC, Johnny Richter, Pakelika, DJ B, Lou Dog
Ain't none of you mother fuckers can ever fuck with the Kottonmouth Kings
We don't really care what people think or what they say
If they like it they like it Its ok
It's all about our creation and our relation
It feels like we been on a never-ending vacation
People have no idea how much fun we've had
Touring the country, makin music in the studio
And I kno that one day is gonna come
And I'll never want it to end
One day I'll be in heaven rockin shows again
Kottonmouth Kings is a lifestyle movement
D-LOC said it so dont ever forget it
Peace....thanks to ya'll
