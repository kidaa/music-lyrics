Take a rip off the kind, yes and what you will find is another plateau
To exhilarate your mind, so break out the herbs and pack up the bongs
We're all getting lifted kicking round love songs

If you think about it all the time, and you can't it off your mind,
And you'll hit it before you hit the kind yeah right
I'm an orgasm addict I always gotta have it
I'm an orgasm addict I always gotta have it
Take a rip off the kind, yes and what you will find is another plateau
To exhilarate your mind, so break out the herbs and pack up the bongs
We're all getting lifted kicking round love songs

Now I once knew this bitch named Antoinette, body like a 'Vette
Had a pussy like a jet, and it was always wet
One night me and Loc had to put it to the test
I called her up come through 10:30
I'll bring the condoms she'll bring the herb, D
She showed up, we got straight to the point
Broke out the herb and we rolled a couple joints, then we all start blazing
Next thing ya know, 3 joint rotation
Before ya know it she was taking off her clothes
D-Loc whispered to me, its another freak show
We dog it out like her last name was rover,
We hit the butt, got up cuz it was over
And to you it might be right or wrong
But to the Kottonmouth kings its just another love song

I'm an orgasm addict I always gotta have it
I'm an orgasm addict I always gotta have it
Take a rip off the kind, yes and what you will find is another plateau
To exhilarate your mind, so break out the herbs and pack up the bongs
We're all getting lifted kicking round love songs

Well I once knew this bitch named Sally
Met her at a club way out in the valley
Took her to the pad and you know she was down,
To get with all 3 hoods from P-Town, then Daddy X walked in hey now
I was hittin from behind, I was nuttin on that chin,
Then he joined on the action
Pulled out a jimmy strapped it on and started taxing
Right then I heard a knock on the door
Bobby B and Pakelika, Can ya handle 2 more
Now this shits getting crazy, 6 dicks flashing damn she amaze me
She musta been coked up, why cuz she took B Dub's 12 inches in the butt
She had dicks up in her, one in the booty, one in the coochie
Grabbing at it like it was dinner
I'm the late night creeper, fuck around I'll get you put up in a sleeper
And any other bull I'll run deeper, I even got your momma on my beeper
Bitch!

I'm an orgasm addict I always gotta have it
I'm an orgasm addict I always gotta have it
If you think about it all the time, and you can't it off your mind
And you'll hit it before you hit the kind yeah right
You're an orgasm addict you always gotta have it
You're an orgasm addict you always gotta have it

Sex in the morning, sex in the evening, sex almost anytime
Sex if its easy, sex if its greasy, never let it pass on by

And I won't turn down the kind with a piece of mind,
But if you ask Daddy X, it's ass before herb each and every time
Pimp Daddy's laying the track down, Suburban Noize, Kottonmouth Kings
Kottonmouth Kings, Kottonmouth Kings
