as we toke through these ozones
plant homegrown family trees
we blow endo smoke
microphones spreadin new philosophies
as we transcend these time zones
there is no guarantee 
so we live fast some die young
we smoke our family trees

hey fool its the L O to the C
Livin life in the fast lane or so it seems
Tourin the country in a big ass bus
Fulfillin my dreams smokin buds is a must
now a days is rough Babylon is a bitch
im twitchin and dippin just to smoke my shit
with a spliff to my lip im quick to trip
equipt with rips and a bottomless pit
water bubbling i'm stumbling i can't stand straight
the land of the free on paper looks great
the home of the brave enforced by guns
breakin tribal ties to our father the sun
mother earths rebirth its time to sew new seeds
negative is how you live so what you gonna reap
good things are sure to come to those who truly believe
now i ain't tryin to preach thats just simply my sleaze

microphone check it i came to wreck it
don't ask no questions im breakin all the records in sections
its my time to shine its my time to climb
the whole world is mine im a freeze it for no reason
with one line ima catch you while you're sleepin
in the middle of the night in your sheets i'll be creepin and deceivin
and i know you can't believe what ya'll seen
but im seekin out the people that are reekin what im speakin
and the seasons off the hizza  all my ink
im thinkin about the weekend while im easin in my region
 and im flowin like the breeze
easily acheived but your eyes deceive
im in it for life stayin high till i die
dloc's no gimmick just look me in the eyes
and if you got something to say 
we can solve it right now
thrownin strikes for the mound and you just got wound

transferring transactions check the note in your bag
its a message from the kings letting you know you've been had
they stole your past brainwashed you in class
and if you didn't listen they'd beat your ass
react fast when i blast i was built to last
didn't make mass my car ran out of gas
that was a joke now laugh what you need another snap
you better look in the mirror while i reflect off my glass
this world is clipped and its gettin me pissed
living life in a hole im gonna die in this abyss
with one last wish and that's to legalize weed
so my seeds can smoke because its in my genes
nothing's for free cept the bud on the branch
these family trees are sittin in my sack
i creep beneath  everlasting underground
and thats on me, Dloc from P-Town
