Wasted away
trapped in their maze
gotta get out

My punk rock's dirty
my hip hop's clean
one side has rust the other triple beam
one side is crazy phat the other's pissed and mean
half of me's got problems the other lives a dream
well
im bi polar im confused
split personality i dont know which to chose
one side is filthy rich the other is dirt poor
Count me out a thousand times i'll still come back for more

we barely just began but already your done
get your ass up off the couch and roll another for fun
cause I ain't even begun barely dented my stash
open your eyes and grab a pipe or else it's time for you to dash
where you gonna go when it's time to dash
grab your sack don't forget your cash
life moves fast gotta chose your path
live while you live cuz it might be your last
watch your back it might be over
sometimes i feel bi polar
i get confused i dont know where to go
so i stop.. slow the tempo
I ain't got hours in my day to smoke with people like you
wastin' my minutes like a cell phone that you merely abuse
with crooked views at first I questioned and these unpaid dues
confuse me not no second guessin session veterans never lose
grab your pipe cuz you look confused
rockin' the mic with your unpaid dues
life's a bitch we win or lose
how many people don't got a clue
dont got a clue gotta figure it out
Kottonmouth Kings will put it in your mouth
eeh haw don't feed the donkeys me and my honkeys smoke that sonkey
yer done, go to bed, pipe it, bye

got nothin
got nothing to say

the world is full of sharks
the water's not that deep
a bunch of dirty sharks are snapping at my sleeve
their poisoning my weed
i think im gonna bleed
and now im gonna jump
well
im bi polar im confused
split personality i dont know which to chose
one side is filthy rich the other is dirt poor
Count me out a thousand times i'll still come back for more

suburbs surprise open you eyes and get a grip on your scene
realize your life's alive and not a fairytale dream
most comfortable with slow flow shows how I like my things
and never pass a packed bowl unless you know there's some green
like whoa burning to the floor
im feelin faded give me some more
drank a beer and rolled a spliff
i do what i do you suck my dick
if you dont like it i dont give a fuck
i just took a shit and i just threw up
blow it out your butt and out my throat
i choke and slow the tempo
going going gone just put it out of the park
another win for home team just put the bite with our bark
just brought some light to the dark another dot hit the mark
you'll never get your bowl burnin if you don't got the spark
pick it back up cuz you might get piped
slow your roll put your shoes on tight
 you might get done
