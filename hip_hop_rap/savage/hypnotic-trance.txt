music - Ben, lyrics - Ben
Hello my friend relax comfortably in your seat
Look into the spiral
Don't let nothing else distract you
As you watch you become very sleeply
Even thuogh you hear every word I say
You're in a hypnotic trance
Stay asleep till I ack you to awaken
Now's the time to expierence your unconscious mind
I control the speed of your heartbeat
With the movement of my hand
You're in a hypnotic trance
solo - Dave, Ben
You are not afraid to tell me anything
Regions of your brain are controlled by my
You have now escaped from reality
I control the direction of your emotional reaction
solo - Ben, Dave, Ben, Dave
You have forgotten everything
Since your eyes have closed
Now I know your hidden fantasies
Things which have never been reveal
I control the power of your mind
Make no effort to remember or forget
Is it just a dream when I snop my finger
You're in a hypnotic trance
