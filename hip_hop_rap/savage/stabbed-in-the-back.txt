music,lyrick - Ben
Living for the unknown
Only searching for trouble
Cheating and stealing from your best friend
No more job, all you do is no good
Running from the police
For stealing a car
Mug a lady of a hundred and five
That only has a dime
Who's the next victim - stabbed in the back
Terror doom, destruction - stabbed in the back
Misleading lies - stabbing in the back
Who's the naxt victim - stabbed in the back
solo - Ben, Dave, Ben, Dave
Evil thoughts eross your mind
As you buy a gun
Rob a supermarket
Leaving no visible trail
Shoot and kill a man
For a twenty dollar bill
Causing misgrief to all the woman you meel
Don't even know who's your son
Giving blood as donor
Knowing that you have AIDS
Always think you're right
But you're really wrong
Living for the unknown
Only searching for trouble
Cheating and stealing from your best friend
No more job, all you do is no good
Parents don't want you
Pay for you to leave the house
Frustrations grow stronger
These past few days
Who's the next
