music - Deszo, lyrics - Deszo
solo - Ben, Dave
Poles lie twisted in the ruins of Warsaw's shattered line
The Wermacht's strenth has left it's mark with lightening speed and power
The West responds uneasily to face another war
The Axis lords plan their assaults for their territory gains
From frozen arctie wastes the battle rages in the in it's fury
To blazing desert sands the land is overrun with blood
On land and sea in the air the swords of nations clash
The West is stabbed a vicious blow and writhes in agony
Blitzkrieg
solo - Dave, Ben
Continental Europe falls under Axis occupation
But England stands infallible despite a constant rain of fire
The Deutsch luftwaffe fail as the RAF stands strong
So the Fuhrer's eyes look to the east to Russia endless plains
solo - Dave, Ben, Dave, Ben
The Russians lines collapse as panzers smash the Easten Front
But far too large a battlefields ends all hopes for victory
Outmatched by vicious weather, Moscow's walls remain secure
And an army's strength and might lie dead and frozen in the snow
