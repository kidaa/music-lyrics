/music - Dave, lyrics - Ron/
Forbidded fruits are the sweetest
Your true messiah
Is frightened by shadows
As he tries to unwind
Whispering wins
Irresistable illusions
A coin in the well is a wish
Serve and suffer, scorn for scorn
Things could be a lot worse
When you think your down regressions
Take a look around
Razorblade maze
Shelter from your pain
There's a cyclone in your mind
It's throbbing it's the end of the lie
But here and now
Life is a great indulgence
Hell is paved with good intentions
But this is our time of joy
solo - Dave , Ben
Before the wild wind's whistling lash
The startled storm cloud reared on high
Singing songs to please myself
All at once things seemed to small
Your griet and mine must interwine
Indulgence
Indulgence
Indulgence
solo - Ben
My eyes trace the horizont
Winter brings another death to a year
Give a free course a choise
It it's denied it's more intensified
Shades of blue or just the shadow of the mind
Sufferdeath but could not die
So here upon my back I'll lie
Gaze my fill into the sky
