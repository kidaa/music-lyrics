I ride this train 
in the windswept afternoon 
and the sunlight warms the faces 
of the faithless who are waiting 
I ride this train 
but I need a conversation 
mozambique or was it veronique
how about you pick the subject
and I'll listen to you

people tell me that I feel too much 
but I don't care, I don't care 
people tell me that I need too much 
but I don't care, no I don't care 

I ride this train 
in a dream-like state of mind
through a field of frozen memories 
imagination racing 
I ride this train 
but I need to make connections 
no I wasn't staring 
I was only trying 
to get some substance 
to get some meaning 

people tell me that I feel too much 
but I don't care, no I don't care 
people tell me that I need too much 
well I don't care, no I don't care 

people tell me that I feel too much 
oh no cause I don't care 
no I just don't care anymore 
I will ride this train 

people tell me that I feel too much 
but I don't care, no I don't care 
people tell me that I need too much 
but I don't care, no I just don't care 

people tell me that I feel too much 
oh no cause I don't care 
no I just don't care anymore 
as I ride this train 

as I ride this train 
as I ride this train 
keep on riding this train 
as I ride this train 
as I ride this train 
oooh
