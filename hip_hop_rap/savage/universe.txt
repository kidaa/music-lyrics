Well I want to take you as I find you 
Imagine our clothes are on the floor 
Feel my caress so soft and gentle 
So delicate you cry for more 
But you know baby 
You know baby does it right 
And you know baby does it right 

[chorus:]

Universe inside of your heart 
You gotta let me know 
so you can be free baby 
You wanted it so much, 
and now that it's over 
You don't know what you want 

Put time in a capsule 
Two minds consensual 
Entwined to perfection 
If we could... 

Cuddle up close 
Lay on my chest now 
Listen my heart beat's coming down 
If you get tired you close your 
eyes now 
When you wake up I won't be found 
'Cause I know baby 
I know you're the nervous kind 
With so much going on in your mind 

[chorus]

But let me tell you that, this time, 
I'm gonna make you mine 
I won't let you go 
'Cause I know, this time 
I'm gonna make sure I look out 
for me 

'Cause you know baby 
Well you know baby does it right 
And you know baby does it right 
You will only end up lost in loneliness 
And wake up with the words already 
on your lips 
So I'll let you go, baby 
So I'll let you go... 

[chorus]
