[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
I get over heels for someone I
That I really can't deal with deal with
I want to block her out my mind
But I really can't do it
I tell myself this the last time
I'ma let her do this to me
Whenever we do spend time
I realize that I can't get enough of you

[Bridge - Patrick Stump Timbaland]
Wipe that smile off your fucking face Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your fucking face Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face Let me say to you

[Chorus - Patrick Stump]
To be despised
To be loved
To be dreamt of
To be sought
To be inside
I don't care
Right in the middle
I'm right in the middle
To be despised
To be loved
To be dreamt of
To be sought
To be inside
I don't care
Be my unholy
My one and my only

[Verse 2 - Patrick Stump]
If I could start with words
Cause it's the only hope of feasting I got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm in his hand
I want to be better than I am

[Bridge - Patrick Stump Timbaland]
Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your fucking face Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your fucking face Let me say to you
Wipe that smile off your face Let me say to you

[Chorus - Patrick Stump]
To be despised
To be loved
To be dreamt of
To be sought
To be inside
I don't care
Right in the middle
I'm right in the middle
To be despised
To be loved
To be dreamt of
To be sought
To be inside
I don't care
Be my unholy
My one and my only

[Verse 3 - Timbaland]
Girl, just look what you've done
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down
I can't let you do this to me
I can't forget those good ole times
And all the things you've been doing to me
I wanna hit that one more time
I mean love, what your doing to me
I'ma say it loud, right here
Let's fuck in this crowd
Why we arguing
I thought me and you were supposed to be
Friends
Let's chill for minute
Better yet we could heal for a minute for a minute
Baby, put down the knife
Sometime I wanna save ya life
Why don't you

[Chorus - Patrick Stump]
To be despised
To be loved
To be dreamt of
To be sought
To be inside
I don't care
Right in the middle
I'm right in the middle
To be despised
To be loved
To be dreamt of
To be sought
To be inside
I don't care
Be my unholy
My one and my only
