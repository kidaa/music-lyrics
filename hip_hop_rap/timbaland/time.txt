[Timbaland:]
I Got A Feeling She Keeps Me In The Dark
I Gotta Get Keep My Eye On Her She Aint'no Walk In The Park
Id Offer This But She Want That She She She Want It All
You See She Wanted To Paint The Picture And Say She My Broad
I Got A Little Tip From Word On The Block People Saying I Shouldn't Get Involved
But I Don' Judge Or And Try To Chage It Cause You Are Who You Are
Im Like The Drug She's Addicted To Me She Can't Leave Me Now
She Always Makin Plans To Date...Then Find Me A Maker Bye Girrll

[Chorus: She Wants Revenge]
Shes Doing Resting On The Hours That Pass Her By
Id Pay Attention If I Thought It Was Worth The Time
I Tell Their Easy But Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For The Laws We Never Gave
Fall Back On Reasons That We Know Won't Stand A Chance
Watching Our Shoulders Like A Memory From The Past
I Tell Their Easy But Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For The Laws We Never Gave

[Timbaland:]
I Couldn't Get Rid Of Shawty If Wanted
Cause She Was Down But I Was Tired Of Playin The Role Like I Ain't Know That She Get Around
Something About This Girl Facinates Me Shes The Type That Likes To Hang With The Stars
The Way She Makes Me Feel And Sedates Me Who Knew We Would Take It This Far
Everywhere That I Try To Go She Gotta Wanna Post Up With My Face On It
Soon As I Walk Out The Door There It Is Wanna Postin Up With My Face On It
Can't Blame My Self And Its Not My Fault Cause Nothing Was Promised At Least I Could Say I
Was Honest But Bye Girll

[Chorus: She Wants Revenge]
Shes Doing Resting On The Hours That Pass Her By
Id Pay Attention If I Thought It Was Worth The Time
I Tell Their Easy But Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For The Laws We Never Gave
Fall Back On Reasons That We Know Won't Stand A Chance
Watching Our Shoulders Like A Memory From The Past
I Tell Their Easy But Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For The Laws We Never Gave

[Intsrumental Break]

[Chorus: She Wants Revenge]
Shes Doing Resting On The Hours That Pass Her By
Id Pay Attention If I Thought It Was Worth The Time
I Tell Their Easy But Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For The Laws We Never Gave
Fall Back On Reasons That We Know Won't Stand A Chance
Watching Our Shoulders Like A Memory From The Past
I Tell Their Easy But Her Hands They Find A Way
Confusing Passion For The Laws We Never Gave
