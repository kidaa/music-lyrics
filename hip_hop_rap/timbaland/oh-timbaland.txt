[Verse 1:]
A aint got no fillin,
Ama let these niggaz know,
A been killin em wit these beats,
Now am spittin dem killer flows,
Whatcha know bout me dog,
Not a damn thing,
Gotta problem u can c me in da streets dog,
Am on 1 man game,
Dont take this lightly,
If a want u dead its done,
A can make dat hype n b cuts,
Nigga ma bread is long,
A done been both sides of the tracks,
U can say a trained da game,
A lotta niggaz tryna get in ma lane,
Err body askin me da same ol thing, what they say

[Chorus: x8]
Oh timbaland,
Where he go run 2?,

[Verse 2:]
A aint goin nowhere dog,
Ama b right here in ya face,
Cant do it like me dog,
Ya kick drum aint got enough bass,
Dont ever talk bad about me,
U jus might make me mad,
N a jus might c u sumwhere,
N brake ur ass in half,
Its nothin but timbaland in da u strip,

Now am in a whole nother zone,
U can let me do me,

O get popped in ya door,
Hit love on the verge 2 da block,
So recognize da game,
Timbaland aint gonna run mowhere baby,
Timbaland got private planes,

[Chorus: x8]
Oh timbaland,
Where he go run 2?,
nowhere

[Verse 3:]
A been around,
Sometime long ago,

Dont act like u aint seen it b4,

Am listenin dog,
U aint sayin shit,
U can keep on wishin,
U never make a hit,
Yeah a got money,
Take it all from me,

U can get a few whips,
U can get a few chips,
U still gon be a lame,
We aint da same my nigga,
Am on some other shit,
I'mma say this plain n simple,
Nigga take this punishment,
Ama take yall on a trip,
Ama take yall on a ride,
And 1 day am gon dip, but a won't be hard to find
