Get Out, You Can't Be In Here, You Have To Get Out.
I Implore You, Please?.. Please?..
You All Going To Die Down Here...

It's Life Or Death, Either One,
The King Is Back, Take Heat And Run,
I Piss And Take A Shit On Ur Beef For Fun,
I Killed The Game, I Aint Even Used A Gun,
Who Better Than Me? Don't Make Me Laugh,
I Run This Shit,They Just Chase My Ass,
I Aint Talkin Shit Nigga, Just Tellin The Facts,
I Think All The Tracks Im Hearin From Niggas Is Whack,
I Be Hearin These Niggas,
What They Say In They Rhymes,
I Took My Spot Nobody Gave Me Mine,
I Make The Beats That Boom Boom Boom! In They Trunks,
U Disagree Homie Then Go On And Jump,
U Can Bump Ur Gum,
U Can Say What U Want,
Thats All U Gon Do Cuz Yall Niggas Is Punks,
Im Number One, U Aint Nuthin' But Shit,
When They Need A Hit Im Who They Gon' And Get,
Talk To Me...

[Chorus:]
If You Got Love For Me I Got Love For You,
If You Wont Fuck Wit Me I Wont Fuck Wichu,
We Can Do It Howeva U Wanna Do,
Nigga If U Dont Fuck Wit Me I Wont Fuck Wit U,
Gon' Head
Kill Yourself Kill Yourself Kill Yourself
Don' Kill Yourself,
Kill Your Self Kill Yourself,
If I Was You I Wouldn' Fell Myself,
Don' Kill Your Self Kill Your Self
Kill Your Self Don' Kill Yourself,
Kill Your Self Kill Your Self
If I Was You I Wouldn' Fell Myself,

Im Tired Of Niggas, Niggas Is Tired,
U Aint A G, I See Bitch In Ur Eyes,
If U Close To Me, U Suposed To Be,
But Most Of U Rap Niggas Is Hoes To Me,
Wherever U From, The Question I Ask,
Is Do U Think I Give A Fuck, Riddle Me That,
Cuz In My Hood And U Jump Into Hell And Back,
This Industry Shit, To Hell Wit That,
I Seen Em Come, I Seen Em Go,
I Doubt If U Can Show Me Sum'in I Aint Seen Before,
Who Suposed To Be In Charge? I Need To Know,
When I Shake Ur Hand Ima Step On Ur Toe,
Go Getcha Gun, Go Getcha Click,
Imma Be Rite Here Chillin Wit Yo Bitch,
U Mad At Me? Cuz Im Gettin Rich,
Well Put The Pistol To Ur Head And Empty The Clip, Pop Nigga!

[Chorus:]
If You Got Love For Me I Got Love For You,
If You Wont Fuck Wit Me I Wont Fuck Wichu,
We Can Do It Howeva U Wanna Do,
Nigga If U Dont Fuck Wit Me I Wont Fuck Wit U,
Gon' Head
Kill Yourself Kill Yourself Kill Yourself
Don' Kill Yourself,
Kill Your Self Kill Yourself,
If I Was You I Wouldn' Fell Myself,
Don' Kill Your Self Kill Your Self
Kill Your Self Don' Kill Yourself,
Kill Your Self Kill Your Self
If I Was You I Wouldn' Fell Myself,

See My Heart, Feel My Pain
Some Of Dese Stars, Some Is Lames,
How They Follow Little Trends To Get They Fame,
I Aint Snappin My Damn Fingers To Get In The Game,
U Claim U Rich, Show Me Son,
If U Got So Many Dollas Then Loan Me One,
Fools Think They Killas They Own A Gun,
When U No U Bout As Sweet As A Honey Bun,
Trash Ur Broads, Behind A Bar,
Like U Dat Dude Frontin Hard,
Vip Bands Dont Make U A Star,
Like We Really Still Dont No Who The Fuck U Are,
Dont Talk Behind My Back Just Call Me Nigga,
Move My Heart To The Side
Make Room To Forgive Ya
If U Still Wanna Hang, We'll Come To Get Ya,
Put The Rope Around Ur Neck And Jump My Nigga!

[Voice:]
