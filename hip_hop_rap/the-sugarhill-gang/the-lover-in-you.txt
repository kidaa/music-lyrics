I am the king of the rappin thing
But love, is really my game
And when it comes, to gettin the finest chicks
I put all the other rappers to shame
The ladies scream when I'm on the scene
They love my 280-Z
And when the party's over they stand in line
to go home with the Master G, ha ha hahhh

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, I know she's in there somewhere

There's one thing beyond a doubt
Inside every rapper there's a lover
who's tryin, to get out
