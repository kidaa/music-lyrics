I'm makin short term goals,whonder whether foes 
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold 
chilly with enough bail money to free a big willy 
high stakes, I got more at stake than philly 
shoppin sprees, copin three, duece fever I guess its fully loaded, 
ah yes, 
bouncin in the lex luger, tires smoke like buddha 
50 g's to the crap shooter, 
niggas can't fade me 
chrome socks beamin, through my periphial I see ya schemin 
stop dreamin',i leave ya body steamin 
niggas is feenin, whats the meanin 
I'm leanin on any nigga intervenin with the sound of my money machine-in 
my cuff runnin over with hundreds 
im one of the best niggas that done it 
six digits and runnin, 
y'all niggas don't want it 
i got the godfather flow, the don juan demarco 
swear to god, don't get it fucked up

takin out this time 
to give you a piece of my mind 
cause you can't knock the hustle 
but though you think you are 
baby one day you'll be a star 

that scene out of state where I drop my slang 
I'm deep in the south kickin up top game 
bouncin on the highway switchin 4 lanes 
screamin through the sun roof money ain't a thang 
your worst fear confirmed, 
me and my fam roll tight like the firm 
gettin down for life, thats right, you better learn 
why play with fire, burn 
we get together like a choir 
to acquire what we desire 
we do dirt like worms 
produce g's like sperm 
til legs spread like germs 
i got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes 
and I sip wine, and split ends exposed 
but y'all don't know...... 
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
cause you can't knock the hustle 

Mary J.Blige 

but until that day then 
I'm the one whose crazy 
cause thats the way ya makin me feel 
cause you can't knock the hustle 
I'm just tryin to get mine, 
i don't have the time 
to knock the hustle for real 

y'all niggas lunchin, punchin a clock 
my function is lo make much 'n' lay back munchin 
sippin remy on rocks, my crew 
somethin to watch nothin to stop 
un... 
...stoppable 
scheme on the ice, I gotta hide your crew 
i gotta 
let you niggas know the time like movado 
my motto, 
stack rocks like colorado 
bottle off the champagne, cristals by the bottle 
its a damn shame what ya knot though 
me
slick like I got though who? 
fuckin Jay-Z 
pops knew exactly what he did when he made me 
tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what 
straight banana's 
can a nigga, see me 
got the US Open, advantage jigga 
serve like sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus 
netigra???, son you're to eager 
you ain't havin it? good, me either 
lets get together and make this whole world believers 
at my araignment, screamin 
all these blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even 
thievin, as long as I'm breathin 
can't knock the way a nigga eatin 
fuck you even
