Verse 1:
The harsh realities of life is takin' toll
For even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me the price to pay to make it home
Take control, I'm makin' doe, but not enough to blow
J O's, they lust my flows, but A-yo
I don't trust a soul, I know I need to
These evil streets will meet you
Halfway than eat you, alive
Tryin' to survive illegal, I leave you lost
Bounce you on the cross, rip you like a horse
Sacrife your life to a higher force
Than I stomp your corpse, it's the Bronx of course
Recognize the acsent, one of the last livin' still in action
General assassin', catchin' an erect, blastin' any tech
Smashin' any chest, passin' any test
Charles Manson in the flesh, any last requests
Before ya meet your maker, so would your reaper wake up
Shakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take ya straight to hell and fill your heart with maden
Incareate your fate in Satan's firey lake
Than I lock the gate, make no mistake
The Shit Is as Real as Joe, we follow the killers code
One becomes the you, tell me, where do you go?
Nowhere to run, hide or find you
In silence you scream and even if you kill me
I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams
Hook:
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East and West crap
Watch the left rack, It ain't where you're from it's where's your gat
Verse 2:
You made a grave mistake, shouldn't of come here
You changed your fate, your brains will make a debut on the table
When I raise the stakes, the pain is great
But only for a second, is starts strong your lesson
Is when your restin'
The Armaggedon set in, left him with so much stress B.S.
Left him with no regrets yes
Welcome to hell son, the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze the person
You get laced for certain
Even Jakes don't trace the work
So close the curtain, I'm hurtin', head serverly
Really tryin' to bring the pain
There's nothing more satisfing then when you cryin' screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain
Floods and blood stains, Big Puns my thugs name
Bustin' my gun, that's my love thang
Slit the jug vein, snatch your Atam's apple
John Madden tackle your corpse
Then hoist it on the cross at the Taben Ackle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body till it burst
The curse of Viva, slangin' ? first,
I'm worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental, essentially meant to be so ?
When you awaken, your manhood will be taken
Faken like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination
Hook X2
Verse 3:
It's hard to analize, which guys is spies
Be advised people, we recognized who lies
It's all in the eyes chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
Theives in undercover cars, takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
Stash a million in the stash
Passport with the gas , first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini shottie, I body a nigga for a penny probably
Im obligated to anything, if it's crime related
If it shine I'll take it, sill in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last addition
Probably stash magician, could of went to college and been a
mathmatician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now I'm strickly out for cream, doin' things to fiends
I doubt you'll ever dream, my teams the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the heavens King, down to the devls mesimean
I never scream so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads died by 25, or catch a quick 3 to 5
So be advised, the streets is full of surprises
It's not what crews the livest, when the survivers who's the wisest
