feat. Donell Jones

[Big Punisher]
You can catch me in the cherry red one-fifty
Got the grizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy goin sixty down a one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin bottles up in Sue's rendevous
Fuck that, spun the U-ey lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack - came back and now, "What's that"
Straight from Paris, checkin Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis nice, auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the Tec for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nuttin less cause it's reala
in the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one eh eh got beef bust yo' gun
You don't need no one nope talkin bout that you owe him
I'ma go for dolo - Scarface without Manolo
One deep, I be solo, bustin heat, throwin bolos, it's hard

[Chorus 1 + 2 overlap]

[Chorus 1: Donnell Jones]

And it's so haaaaaard, yeah
Niggaz wanna be like Pun, but they don't bust they guns
and it's so haaaaaard..
Niggaz wanna fuck my wife, niggaz wanna take my life
but it's so haaaaaard..

[Chorus 2: Big Punisher]

It's hard work baby
I just lost a hundred pounds, I'm tryin to live
I ain't goin nowhere I'm stayin alive baby..
That's my wife, I paid for them titties
Get your own, your own, ya heard
Niggaz wanna fuck my wife, niggaz wanna take my life
but it's so haaaaaard..

[Big Punisher]
Rollin with the Squad, we like Gods
Catch us at the bar-de-bar-de-bars
Strip bars in Miami, almost came home with the Grammy
Next year, bringin home three for the family
Watch me, you can catch it live on the Hitachi
Poppin shit like a Nazi, iced out like DeBiase
Fuck that, Liberace
Fo'-X Versace, somebody stop me!
Never that, SKEE-YU!  Where my niggaz at
Uptown! Uptown!  You know you feelin that
"Cash Rule," hardcore you can dance to
That old Biggie give me, "Onnne More Chaaaaance.."
Take a glance and I'm off with yours
with both hands take off my drawers 
and jerk me like the Source Awards
I love hip-hop, I ain't even probably the best lyricist alive
Terror Squad nigga stop sleepin, ooh yeah

[Big Punisher - overlaps chorus]
What you say your name was again
And I know you from where Elementary school
.. I don't know you maaaaan!
Money, not you again
Go THAT way!
Loser!

[Chorus 3: Donell Jones starts where Pun says "I don't know you"]

Niggaz wanna be like Pun, but they don't bust they guns
and it's so haaaaaard..
Niggaz wanna fuck my wife, niggaz wanna take my life
but it's so haaaaaard..
Yeah, cause you ain't fuckin my wife, takin my life
And if you just hatin just walk on by...
All you haters just walk on by
