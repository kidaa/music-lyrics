[Big Punisher] 
I don't give a fuck! Til I die, I'ma live it up 
Hit em up, nigga what what, nigga what? 
Better watch yo' ass 'fore I pull the choppers out the stash 
and helicopter yo' ass, about a block and a half 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
Where you at Prop? 

[Prospect] 
Aiyyo it's off with his head 
Let the blood-shed, cause all my thug sons'll bust lead 
Yo I rep like one of the best, my Mac numbin your flesh 
They on tracks but they runnin from death 
Who fuckin with 'spect? Yo dog, I'm the youngest to rep 
Comin correct, niggaz know I blow my gun in a sec 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
What the deal Twin? 

[Big Punisher] 
Yeeeah baby! Aiyyo it's off with his head 
Slap the shit out the Devil and tear his horns off his head 
Aiyyo it's almost over, few months we all gon' know Jehovah 
Til then I'ma keep the steel in the shoulder holster 
I ain't ready to die, bury me alive 
But if my nigga got beef, we goin together tonight 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
What you say Twin? 

[Prospect] 
Aiyyo it's off with his head 
Left a body stiff and dead with the infrared 
It's hard to survive, ? armor hold ? this tribe 
And takin niggaz lives, so what? They tryin take mine 
What I'm supposed to do? Let shit slide like I was close to you? 
This murder I write, pushin a hearse, let me chaffeur you 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
What the deal ?Pun? 

[Big Punisher] 
Aiyyo it's off with his head 
Nigga I was born in the fuckin Dawn of the Dead 
I always got my Dunn like I always got my gun 
Fresh out the box, oiled and cocked, Glock 21 
Once I have a gun to pop, I ain't gon' stop til I'm done 
So either call the cops, or bust a shot - nigga uhh 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
Hold me down Pros' 

[Prospect] 
Aiyyo it's off with his head 
Put that nigga to sleep and make a coffin his bed 
I come from rough times where niggaz bust 9's and be like fuck rhymes 
and puff dimes, slippin on front lines and lust crimes 
You better trust mines, I'm down for the cause 
Gimme a round of applause and hear the sound of the 4's 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
What the deal kid? 

[Big Punisher] 
Aiyyo it's off with his head 
Cock the lead redecorate the crib burgandy red 
Aiyyo I never front, I want whatever nigga let's dump 
Whoever want it gonna get lift with the pump 
I mention I'm dumb, my trigger finger fittin to jump 
Got the whole left side of my face twitchin and stuff 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
Take us home Dunn 

[Prospect] 
Aiyyo it's off with his head 
He ain't really want it so he lost it instead 
"Picture Me Rollin" like 'Pac in the drop, my style too hot 
to figure out, oh Lord, please don't make me put this nigga out 
My trigger shout through your area code 
The scary explos', your click get, leary of foes 
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz 
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz 
Now it's on Twin - now it's on Twin 
Yeah, hah, now it's on Twin
