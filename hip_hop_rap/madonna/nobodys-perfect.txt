Cool I am when I am with you 
Cool I'm not when I am lonely 

I feel so sad 
What I did wasn't right 
I feel so bad 
And I must say to you 
Sorry, but 

Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
What did you expect 
I'm doin my best 

I feel so sad 
But you know I'll be true 
I feel so bad 
And I must say to you 
Sorry, but 

Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
What did you expect 
I'm doin my best 

Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
I was dishonest 
I will do my best, yeah 

Cool I am when I am with you 
Cool I'm not when I am lonely 

Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
What did you expect 
I'm doin my best 
Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
I was dishonest 
I'm doin my best 
Nobody's perfect 
Nobody's perfect 
I was dishonest 
I will do my best
