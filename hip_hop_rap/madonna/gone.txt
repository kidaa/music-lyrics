Selling out 
Is not my thing 
Walk away 
I won't be broken again 
I'm not 
I'm not what you think 
Dream away your life 
Someone else's dream 
Nothing 
Equals nothing 

Letting go 
Is not my thing 
Walk away 
Won't let it happen again 
I'm not 
I'm not very smart 
Why should I be sad 
For what I never had 
Nothing 
Equals nothing 

Turn to stone 
Lose my faith 
I'll be gone 
Before it happens 

Turn to stone 
Lose my faith 
I'll be gone 
Before it happens 

Selling out 
Is not my thing 
Walk away 
I won't be broken again 
I'm won't 
I'm won't fall apart 
Dream away your life 
Dream away your dream 
Nothing 
Equals nothing 

Turn to stone 
Lose my faith 
I'll be gone 
Before it happens 

Turn to stone 
Lose my faith 
I'll be gone 
Before it happens
