Imminilalo Imminilalo

Staring up into the heavens
In this hell that binds your hands
Will you sacrifice your comfort
Find you way in a foreign land

Wrestle with your darkness
Angels call your name
Can you hear what they are saying
Will you ever be the same

[Chorus]
Mmmm mmm mmm
Imminilalo Imminilalo
Mmmm mmm mmm
Imminilalo Imminilalo

Remember, remember
Never forget
All of your life has all been a test
You will find the gate that's open
Ever though your spirit's broken

Open up my heart
Cause my lips to speak
Bring the heavens and the stars
Down to earth for me

[Chorus X2]

Wrestle with your darkness
Angels call your name
Can you hear what they are saying
Will you ever be the same

[Chorus X2]
