Dark eyes on a dangerous face you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place you are a beautiful killer
You dont have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I dont understand
I dont know much about you are a wanted man

You can call my name and Ill be a around
Maybe Ill let you shoot me down
Cause youre a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you wont leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a beautiful killer
I like your silhouette when you stand on the streets
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and Ill be a around
Maybe Ill let you shoot me down
Cause youre a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you wont leave a trace

Cant really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe thats what you been dreaming about
Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

Beautiful killer

You changed the past
Good guys always finish last
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

You can call my name and Ill be around
Maybe Ill let you shoot me down
You can call my name and Ill be around
Maybe Ill let you shoot me down
Cause youre a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you wont leave a trace

Cant really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe thats what you been dreaming about
Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

Youre a beautiful killer, but youll never be Alain Delon
