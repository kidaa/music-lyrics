A long long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance, and maybe they be happy for a while! 

Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above, if the bible tells you so, and now do you belive in Rock n Roll can music safe your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow. Well I know that you are in love with him caus I saw you dancing in the gym, you both kicked off your shoes - man I dig those rythem n blues. I was a lonely teenage broncin buck with a pink carnation and a pick up truck, but I knew that I was out of love - the day the music died 

Chorus: We were singing bye bye Ms American Pie drove my Chevey to the levee but the levee was dry, them good old boys were drinking Whiskey and Rye - singin this will be the day that I die! 

I meet agirl how sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away. I went down to the sacret store were I have heared the music years before but the man there said the music wouldn't play. And in the streets the children screemed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed, but not a word was spoken the church-bells all were broken. And the three men I admire most the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost - they caugth the last train for the coast the day the music died. 

Chorus: We were singing bye bye Ms American Pie drove my Chevey to the levee but the levee was dry, them good old boys were drinking Whiskey and Rye - singin this will be the day that I die!
