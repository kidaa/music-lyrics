Don't tell me to stop 
Tell the rain not to drop 
Tell the wind not to blow 
'Cuz you said so 
Mmmm, Mmmm 

Tell the sun not to shine 
Not to get up this time 
No no 
Let it fall by the way 
But don't leave me where I lay down 

Tell me love isn't true 
It's just something that we do 
Tell me everything or nothing 
Please don't tell me to stop 

Tell the leaves not to turn 
But don't ever tell me I'll learn 
No, No 
Take the black off a crow 
But don't tell me I have to go 

Tell the bed not to lay 
Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah 
Not to stare up at me 
Like a calf down on his knees 

Tell me love isn't true 
It's just something that we do 
Tell me everything or nothing 
Don't ever tell me to stop 

Don't you ever tell me 
Love isn't true 
It's just something that we do 
Don't you ever tell me everything or nothing 
Don't ever tell me to stop
