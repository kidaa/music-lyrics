this is not a love song
bye bye baby

I keep on waiting, anticipating
but I can't wait forever
you say you love me
you're thinking of me
but we're never together

Chorus:
bye bye baby bye bye
it's your turn to cry
that's why we have to say goodbye
so say goodbye

you had your chances
all your romances
and now I just don't want you
I know I love you
because I hate you
and now I'd rather hount you

chorus

you're so beautiful
what makes you feel exciting
what makes you up inside
does it make you feel good to see me cry
I think it does
that's why it's time to say goodbye

chorus

I don't wanna keep the bright flame
of your ego going
so I'll just stop blowing in the wind
to love you is a sin
adios

uh! this is not a love song

I'd like to hurt you
what ecxites you
what turns you on
what makes you feel good
does it make you feel good to see me cry
I think it does
that's why it's time to say bye bye
bye bye!
the first time and the last time
you can forget about it baby
forget the rules, forget the fool
forget your fears, forget my tears
you can forget about it baby
bye bye baby bye bye
you can forget about it baby
bye bye baby bye bye
you can forget about it baby
'cause it's the first time and the last time
you'll ever see me cry
