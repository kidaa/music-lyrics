When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like youre going to go insane

Theres a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And its here I begin my story

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Dont ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

It was time that I opened my eyes
Im leaving the past behind
Nothings ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams

Im stuck like a moth to a flame
Im so tired of playing this game
I dont know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage cause Im dying

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Dont ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Dont ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Dont ask me to explain how I feel
Cause I dont want to say where Im going

Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Dont have a choice cause the temperatures pounding
Leaving this place is the last thing I do
That I want to escape with a person just like you

Im stuck like a moth to a flame
Im so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun it its all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Dont ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Theres somethings you dont need to know
Just let me turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio
