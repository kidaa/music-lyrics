I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

Im sorry
Im not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I cant

Im so ashamed
Youre in so much pain
I blamed you when things didnt go my way
If I didnt, youd be here
If I didnt fight back Id have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but theyre not

I could have just kept
My big mouth closed
I could have just done
What I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

Im sorry
Im not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I cant

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
You wanna know how to make God laugh
Tell him your plans...

We could've bought a house with a swimming pool,
Filled it up with warmers, It would be so cool,
Could've gone riding stallions in the country side,
With a pack of RingDings, we sing eye to eye

We could've toured the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We could've climbed a mountain, seen a perfect sun rise,
Written our names across the sky
We could've gotten drunk and driven on the autobahn
We could've got ourselves arrested and sober up
We could've lived life crazy 'til the day we die
Instead I made you cry..

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

Im sorry
Je suis dsole
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
Im not ashamed to say
I wish I could have it back maybe one day
Or not.
