Intro 
Girls can wear jeans and 
Cut their hair short 
Wear shirts and boots 
It's okay to be a boy 
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading 
Because you think that being a girl is degrading 
But it seems to me 
You'd love to know what it's like 
Wouldn't you 
What it feels like for a girl 

Silky smooth 
Lips as sweet as candy, baby 
Tight blue jeans 
Skin that shows in patches 
Strong inside, but you don't know it 
Good little girls they never show it 
And you open up your mouth to speak 
Would you be a little weak 

Do you know 
What it feels like for a girl 
Do you know 
What it feels like in this world 
For a girl 

Hair that twirls on fingertips so gently 
Baby 
Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting 
Hurt that's not supposed to show 
And tears that fall when no one knows 
When you're trying hard to be your best 
Could you be a little less

For a girl

Strong inside but you don't know it

Could you be a little weak
