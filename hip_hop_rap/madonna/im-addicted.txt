When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I cant get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
Id write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

Feels like a drug
And I cant get enough
And it fits like a glove
Im addicted to your love
Im addicted to your love
Im addicted to your love

Im addicted, Im addicted, Im addicted to your...
Im addicted, Im addicted, Im addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
Its like MDMA and thats OK

Your name's like a drug
And I cant get enough
And it fits like a glove
Im addicted to your love

Im addicted, Im addicted, Im addicted to your...
Im addicted, Im addicted, Im addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I dont care if you think that Im strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
Im ready to take this chance
I need to dance

Feels like a drug
And I cant get enough
And it fits like a glove
Im addicted to your love

Im addicted, Im addicted, Im addicted to your...
Im addicted, Im addicted, Im addicted to your love

MDMA, MDMA, MDMA, MDMA Im addicted
MDMA, MDMA, MDMA, MDMA Im addicted
