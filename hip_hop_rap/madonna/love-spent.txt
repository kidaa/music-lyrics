You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you have married me if I were poor
Yes, if I was your treasury
Youd have found a time to treasure me

How come you cant see
All that you need
Is right here with me

Up until the end
All this pretend
Wasnt for free

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me
Now you have your money
Spend it til theres nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

If we opened up a joint account
Would it put an end to all your doubt
Frankly if my name was Benjamin
We wouldnt be in the mess were in

You played with my heart
Till death do we part
Thats what you said
Now you have your fast cars
Women and bars
Its gone to your head

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me
Love me like your money
Spend it til theres nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold on to it
Till theres nothing left

Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, Im love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah Im love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms
Until theres nothing left nothing left, nothing left

Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, Im love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah Im love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms
Until theres nothing left nothing left, nothing left
