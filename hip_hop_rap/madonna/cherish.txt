Cherish, cherish...

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny, I can't let go baby can't you see
Cupid please take your aim at me

Chorus:

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side oh baby I
Cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life I'm always singing it
Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good and baby I
Perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

chorus

Who You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Who You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

chorus

Give me faith give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
