Hook:
Settin' it off lettin' it off whatever     x4
Let 'em have it L What
Give it to 'em L Yeah     x3
Let 'em have it

Verse 1:
A-yo I'm serious I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black never seen in polka dots
No other writes rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze 
I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
Smoother than velvet 
My lyrics are well writ
You sayin' L's this and L's that
Get off L dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325 I's
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone 
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin' 
Black white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up 
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up

Hook

Verse 2:
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
Yo it's all about me it's a B. I. G.  L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes 
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator 
I grab a mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
Where raps are hotter than old   
MCs be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing cause every hero got a theme song

Hook

Verse 3:
The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact black I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
What's up cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then talkin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride
I just committed a homicide 
A punk brother died cause he tried 
To take my cash but he didn't last
I pulled out fast 
I tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass boom
I make a lot of doe 
I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate she gotta go
When I was young I played with guns not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a ruff rugged gangsta not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody be like Mike but Mike wanna be like L

Hook

Big L Outro:
A-yo big shots to all them niggas on the corner 
doin' something they ain't got no business doin'
I gotta say what's up to S amp;S, Doo Wop, and the Bounce Squad
Can't forget my peeps from Brooklyn youknowhatI'msayin' 
Like Box and Herb and Big Sid

A-yo L you must be buggin' B
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes B

Big L:
Oh yeah we gotta say what's up to the hoes man

Word up let's go see our P.O.
