Bust it
Hey yo, I just left the studio, and it's about 2 in the morn'
I just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep
My voice is harsh, barely can speak
I called back on the cell
It's Coley, mad as hell
He told me to listen well as he started to yell
 quot;I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room in the Holiday Inn quot;
 quot;It's my wife, you sure quot;
 quot;Yeah I'm sure
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door quot;
 quot;Yo, say no more, which one quot;
 quot;The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge quot;
 quot;We goin' hurt those hoes quot;
 quot;And hurt both of them kids quot;
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin dames
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cup
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
 quot;Yo, who that in the background quot;
 quot;It's Tommy Giss quot;
 quot;Oh, I didn't recognise you with your hat down
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out quot;
 quot;Yeah, wo goin to take the backroute
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on
We ain't leavin till everyone's dead and all the cash gone quot;
 quot;We goin to get our laugh on when we're through
But right now we got a job to do quot;
 quot;So let's do it quot;
Hey yo, I stepped to the deskclerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her to listen up before she get hurt
 quot;They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got quot;
She paused and said  quot;212 quot;
Took the steps now I'm out of breath
I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes goin be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in
Each had a cannon
Ready to take care, how we done planned it
 quot;These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate quot;
We know they got stacks
Cause they don't move with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin 'em loose
 quot;Hey man, I kicked Mike in his face
So I just had your back
You wanna live and tell my nigga where the stash at quot;
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash
A 100 pound of grass, and 2 million in cash
I was dumb glad
The sit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks
 quot;Hey yo', fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs quot;
Man that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money threeways
Now we all laughin hard, gettin nice and weeded
Celebratin nigga, heist completed
