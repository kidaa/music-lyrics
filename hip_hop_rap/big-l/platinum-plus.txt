[Big L]
Yo, I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke hoe
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with cocoa, strong as bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum ro-ro
Anti-homo, that's a no-no so fuck po'-po'
I push the seven-fo'-oh and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I'm with a bitch on dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I, buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds
My underground niggaz, y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now, so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
that's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be

Chorus Two: Big L repeat 2X

Aiyyo, gats we bust backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
cause half of you niggaz that's rappin now is wack to us

[Big Daddy Kane]
And cats still wonder can they get as hot as he been
That probably depends, let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriotts down to Quality Inns
Hit the bar spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out, rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood, flippin the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggaz come in the game, block they shot at the rim
That ain't in you - the FUCK you gon' possibly win
I do it,  quot;Booty Calls quot; on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip, make cream just like Ready Whip
Heavy with, styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit watch how much lead he get
You tryin to go places, chasin Oasis
About nothin gettin low wages
Drink Hennessey with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frasier's
I'm the bodacious
Body parts are big and like Schwarz-a-niggaz
Smokin Garcia Vega tryin to get the larger paper
If you, block the cash, we lockin ass
I'ma put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
but I don't mind to burn niggaz like CD's
Now - exhibit, styles I kick with it
[*COUGH*] Pardon me, but I'm fuckin sickwiddit
