It Wasn't Us 

[Chorus - repeat 2x] 
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, 
shit like that, maybe because I get like that, 
kick like that, rip like that 
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, 
climb like that, cuz the world is mine like that 
yours like that mine like that 

[Ludacris] 
You can get your whole crews, even niggas that owe you 
They ain't paid you shit you can drink some cold brew 
and throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip 
you can come and find us, be right behind us and insert the clip 
You hear something that went "clack" "clack" "clack" 
Somebody went down but it wasn't us 
you can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal 
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile 
Get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes 
Tou can even start eatin' good and smokin' good 
but you pressin' your luck and you say wha' 
Somebody went bankrupt shiit but it wasn't us 

Chorus 

[Ludacris] 
You can go to the drawing board just start from stratch 
All over again clean 
or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch 
But my niggas is the police 
you can try to blame me or even try to frame me but I'll make bail now 
somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us 
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque 
CD's on rack after rack no moe selling sac' after sac' 
You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife 
It was yours to earn but the records stores gettin' returns 
shiit but it wasn't us 

Chorus 

[Ludacris] 
You could be 
goin on worldwide tours and see your face on every magezine 
or you can flip to channel after channel 
and see that ass on the TV screen 
You can pay for expensive videos 
and have whole lot of big bootie hoes 
but when the shit start comin to a close 
shiiit but it wasn't us 
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man 
and start think'in quick 
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros 
and tell 'em to suck a dick 
and you tell just to get deez 
and you tell just to pay the fees 
and to pay their dues, and they catchin those STD's 
Shiit but it wasn't us 

Chorus repeat 2x
