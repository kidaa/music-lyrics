Bronson, mutha fucker, give me more than three feet 
DTP in the club, we comin' more than three deep 
Your whole crew is weak and my squad is real cash getters 
Stayin' more to crunk, our shit bump like bad clippers 
How many try to hustle with Dealer then went broke 
Infamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke 
I gotta enough guns for beef, if you want it that way 
I'll push your wig back like finger waves or bad toupee 

[Ludacris]
I lick a load of you niggaz, leave kids in the hallways 
Catch 'em at they locka hoo-ahh, blocka blockagun shots 
See 'em on Broadway and tap they ass 
Catch 'em in the swimming pool and overlap they ass 

[Fate]
I'm from the southside, College Park 
G Road, niggas gone 
Ride when the beef starts 
Don't hold back, let the heat spark 
One's through his vest, one's through his chest 
Sleepy hollows put the niggas to rest, uh 

Chorus
[Ludacris]
Fuck That! 
Get the fuck back!

Bitch, your whole town better love that 
Cuff that

What's that 
People gon' die tonight 

What you know about projects, hoes, and murda 
whole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners 
Whole lotta dope fiends, trying to scheme the workers 
Whole lotta feds, got them niggas scared to surface 
Type of bitch that got the brown in my sock 
Find me on tha block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop 
Watch me, pull up on me real sweet in a drop 
But if you fuckin' with my paper, feel the heat from the glock, nigga 

[Ludacris]
We pop bottles, bottles, 
right over you head, niggas 
Put nozzles, nozzles 
Right over your leg, niggas 
Our motto, motto 
Is kill 'em instead, niggas 
We make 'em loose weight, when we Jenny Craig, niggas 

[I-20]
All of ya'll is half nice, half thugs, and half assed 
The only time Im goin' half, is half on a half 
But I use a full clip, cuz I'm a full fledged killa 
Part-time MC, full-time drug dealer 

Chorus
[Ludacris]
Fuck That! 
Get the fuck back!

Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack 
Cuff that 
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that 
What's that 
People gon' die tonight

What's that 
People gon' die tonight 

We the filthy niggas from the South, A-Town represent us 
Strong armin' motherfuckers, like a Russian sickle 
You got issues with us talkin' shit on mixed tapes 
Ill catch you at a show and beat you with a mix tape 
You best pump brakes, 'fore I pump shells and blood oze 
I leave niggas like burps burp, excuse 
Just keep on pissin me off, like a week kidney 
And you will find your family reading your obituary 

[Ludacris]
These people tryin' to scrub the red off 
Stains they don't get off 
They wanted to bring the pain, so this thang 'bout to set off 
Barretas for getting cheddar, you're better off dead off 
Yes, you can do it, cut his fuckin head off 

[Shawna]
I got a letter from the government, the other day 
They told me that the bitches caught a shipment of my yay 
They on their way, three minutes to get the k 
Two minutes to get the weight, one minute and imma spray 

Chorus
[Ludacris]
Fuck That! 
Get the fuck back! 
We make your skull crack 
Tuck that 
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack 
Cuff that 
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that 
What's that 
People gon' die tonight 

[Shawna]
Fuck That! 
Get the fuck back! 
We make your skull crack 
Tuck that 
Bitch, your whole town better love that 
Cuff that 
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that 
What's that 
People gon' die tonight 

Repeat 2x [1st time Ludacris, 2nd time Fate] 
Bang bang kill a man let his brains hang 
And when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane 
They put me in a ward, imma have to maintain 
But when I hit bricks won't a damn thing change
