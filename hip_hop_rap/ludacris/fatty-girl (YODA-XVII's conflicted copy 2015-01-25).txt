[Ludacris]
Yo
Girl you taste like a cinnabun so sweet from the thighs to the cheeks
Sex on the beach check the size of my beast
Call me the pusher Ludacris king ding-a-ling seat smusher
Sweet street pusher give me that gusher.. nasty stuff
Look up I took her..ran out of liquor... time to re-up
Here comes her nigga who give's a fuck
Rap fame and plat thangs they cant hang
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange
Jing-a-ling ding-a-ling oh no they cant stop
Take it to the floor back up and then drop
Effervescent.. time times of the essence
Make em undress in less then 3 seconds
So roars keep steppin whore's keep slobbin
Sex as a weapon clothes that I slept in streets keep mobbin
Thieves keep robbin get two in yo butt three to yo noggin
Creepin and crawlin I'm incogneg
Cant catch the balls then you in the wrong league
Let a dog breathe watch a pimp walk
Shut yo ass up when you hear a pimp talk
Risky and clean crispy of creams
You lookin mighty fine in them jeans

Havin young ladies bustin like 380's
Lubricated silencers crushin all challengers
Gats that be claiming they glocks but really dillingers

Hair like brillo .. cuttin up my pillow got em sayin hello
Naked in a tub of a jello.. still no competition
Still flow nigga listen im not supposed to do this type of thing I'm a christian

Hey yo, welcome home Murray!
[Keith Murray]
This isn't thought of those broads who got the goods
To the chicks who dont and its still all good
Some broads got an automatic thickness for 8
You'll soon get it just stay workin hard at it
Goodness gracious good god almighty
You got a bodunka dong girl dont hurt nobody
Toes all painted .. feet all out
Here's an aphrodesiac for the mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky gut slappin ball slappin
Cater to yo every fantasy
You got the tongue clitterous tits and belly pierced
Necklace around yo waist toe rings, girl do yo thing
I mean in them jeans yo shape is beautiful
And everything is clean cut down to the cuticle
Whoo wee jesus jo jo casey and mary girl you dont know what you do to me
aint no doubt about it..
When she walk by tongues hang out eyes pop out the socket
BING! cats cringe and point like pssh ummph
You can see that thang from the front
We gas those up like full service
and keep em drunk like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it.. you rock my world
I done died and went to heaven.. you got a fatty girl

[chorus]
Oh you guys want a..
