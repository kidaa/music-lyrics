Women indeed, keep ya eyes closed

Low pros, low bows, watch out for the po-po 
And I chose, to be dat numba one contender, Southern offender
Fuckin up ya whole Agenda 
When I walk you try to run 
When I run you try to hide 
You skated the snap of my finger 
Call me Golden Gley 
Its you and I, Do or Die, who am I? 
I got a pocket full of family stones, cats think I'm sly 
Oh Why try, you one of dem niggaz that like to cheat death 
and I'm one of dem niggaz that rip up Excursions

You shit out wheat chex and fart out deep breaths 
While we toss darts at the bottom of y'all v-necks

No glove, no love, betta tell yo dick to run for cover 
So when lightening strikes, you can be safe on a few rubbers
