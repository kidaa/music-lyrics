Is That Your Wife 
You Girlfriend 
Or Is That Your Main Bitch 
How Much Money Do Y'all Be Makin 
And Are You Really That Rich 
Are Those Rumors Really True About The Size Of Your Dick

What In The World Is In That Room 
Why Can't I Go In That Room 
Because That Spells Doom 
Get It Doom 
Get It Doom Doom
