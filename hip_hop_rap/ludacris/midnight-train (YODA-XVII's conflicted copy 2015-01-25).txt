Midnight Train 

Verse 1: 
It started off in Shanny Park 
On the street of old Nash 
And it feels so good to escape and just kick it at last 
My clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream 
Or you could eat over at Ryan's or some fish and got seen 
And I had to fix a goodie bag and make decisions and heist 
Cause Soulfood ain't the mutherfucking thing to waste 
So lets get looney on the set cause I got five on the fire 
Will slide through Eastpoint and make our way to blackrighya 
Looking like Outkast on the spot smoking blunts 
Hit the liquor store 
Got up got out and got something 
The 8 ball so I could do some space age pimpin 
My blood stay young off of 45 colts and chicken 
Camalton Road filled wit D's and vogues and 
Players making them hoes in tight clothes 
Coming up slamming caddy doors 
IS south worst will take it to your chest 
We got it locked like some niggas on house arrest 
Because we riding 

Chorus: 
Riding on that midnight train to Georgia 
Riding 

Verse 2: 
It's just one of those day when 
I can kick it like this and like that 
It's a free world my folks got Rowdy 
Where you at 
I'm right off cascade or Ralph David Avenue 
And I shall proceed or continue to keep my roots nappy 
Cause afro and all ceasers they keep me warm 
Some living a thug life so how long were they born 
I still rhyme that's why I bounce my way to bankbread 
I so bad that I'll knock you out 
That's what my mamma said 
Sippin on brandy sunny days wit my best friend 
Hit her you seein then cruise to the Westend 
They should have said that it was Six Flags 
Over Georgia then underground if my crew 
Stays we'll be fat when I'm older 
If I told you once I told you ass a 
Thousand times that I got em all in 
Check when it comes to bustin rhymes 
Don't sweat the technique as I just move the crowd 
My Mob Deep of alcoholics people label us 
Loud because we riding 

Chorus 

Verse 3: 
See I felt my bones jump 
As I crossed the road 
I heard the squad was quite def so I flipped my mode 
On my way to DEC baby can't you see 
That the cader is too BIG for the 
Lost boys riding around in Lexus coups Jeeps and Beakers 
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina Carpet Cleaners 
In stone mountain cats putting it down 
Daz n Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound 
Now my conflict was crucial off some hey smoke 
I should be getting it cause life is too god damn short 
And now my mind play tricks 
And all my boys acting ghetto 
Back to the CP I put my pedal to the medal 
God bless the child that's just got it's own 
Since I was a juvenile I'm making cash money at home 
Now from a boy to a man I reached the end of my road 
It's Ludacris signing off till the next episode. 

Chorus 

Cause it's the ATL 
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell 
We got the cash find the ass then bail 
We leave a trace but never leave a trail.
