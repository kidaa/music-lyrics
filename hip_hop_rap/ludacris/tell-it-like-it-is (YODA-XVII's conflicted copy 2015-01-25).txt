[Verse 1]
Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be 
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry 
Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang 
How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name? 
Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session 
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession 
Start up ya own company, trademark the name 
That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change 
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps 
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks 
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need 
Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed 
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered 
Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard! 
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be 
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me 

[Hook]
But I can't hold my tounge 
I'ma tell it like it is 
This biz ain't all fun 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Give it to ya straight, no chase 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Look you straight in yo face 
And I'ma tell it like it is 

I can't hold my tounge 
I'ma tell it like it is 
This biz ain't all fun 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Give it to ya straight, no chase 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Look you straight in yo face 
And I'ma tell it like it is 

[Verse 2]
See, mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems 
The money could be the problem, but money can't solve 'em 
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy 
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy 
I'm close 'cause those close wanna live off my fame 
And that type of shit alone will drive a nigga insane 
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandelous promoters 
Crabs will try to sue ya, magazines will misquote ya 
Most of these label-heads, they don't care nothin' about ya 
If you stop sellin' records, they'll act like they don't know ya 
It's hard mixin' business with pleasure, so don't play 
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other day 
Rappers ain't above the law, but our life is so fast 
That we got a Special Task Force of police on our ass 
All that, and this is really just the start of it 
Hip Hop, you really wanna be a part of it? 

[Hook]
I can't hold my tounge 
I'ma tell it like it is 
This biz ain't all fun 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Give it to ya straight, no chase 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Look you straight in yo face 
And I'ma tell it like it is 

I can't hold my tounge 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Man this biz ain't all fun 
I'ma tell it like it is 
I'ma give it to ya straight, no chase 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Look you straight in yo face 
And I'ma tell it like it is 

[Verse 3]
What's worse than havin' no money is havin' it and losin' it 
What's worse than havin' some money is grabbin' and abusin' it 
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool wit him 
I wish his ass well, but I don't want nothin' to do with him! 
Some don't own they publishin', me I never fool wit 'em 
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em 
'Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant 
Unless I'm still in competition with my president 
And believe that I'm supportin' the Hova 
''Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over' 
But the first rule to accumalation of wealth 
Is Don't trust nobody but ya God damned self! 

[Hook]
I can't hold my tounge 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Man this biz ain't all fun 
I'ma tell it like it is 
I'm give it to ya straight, no chase 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Look you straight in yo face 
And I'ma tell it like it is 

I said I can't hold my tounge 
I'ma tell it like it is 
This biz ain't all fun 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Give it to ya straight, no chase 
I'ma tell it like it is 
Look you straight in yo face 
And I'ma tell it like it is
