Rock And A Hard Place 

Yeah yeah 
It's an everyday struggle 
Trying to get out 
Trying to get out 
Trying to make it 
Check this out nigga 
What 

Chorus: 
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place 
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase 
I keep looking it ain't no dough 
So I don't wanna look no mo what 
repeat 

I need to get away to another day or place in time 
And find where reality can ease my mind 
And shine on me like the sons of the earth 
For what it's worth my turf is ruff and rugged so I gave birth 
To a dream where cream lies between 
All the dirt and the gravel so I battle to achieve my green 
And still try to move forward at a steady pace 
Cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase 
So I erase the crime lies and sad cries 
Wit sore eyes and keep mines on the uprise 
But it don't work cause im steady getting jerked 
By my neighborhood up to no good where bad niggas lurk 
The urk me leaving effects that's too negative 
So Ludacris is looking for a better place to live 
And I can't stand it it's really got me buggin 
It's like im in the war and I just keep on tuggin cause i'm 

Chorus 

I try to find a way outta this maze 
It's got me crazed im in a daze 
So many ways to boost into a different phase 
But I can't think I can't do nothing 
You think I'm fronting 
You hear me grunting 
Lord you ain't even saying nuttin 
I need some currency before there's an emergency 
Forget crimes I won't let my mind get the best of me 
It's not gone happen I'm trapped in two worlds 
On one side I see diamonds on the other I see pearls 
It's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides 
So I'm gone with the wind and come right back with the tide 
Cause I keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds 
And when my mouth is shut up it makes my thoughts get loud 
It's like a crowd in a stadium 
Mils I be craving em 
Money making schemes locked up in my cranium 
Cause I need outta this critical situation 
My mind's in jail I don't know the time that it's facing I'm 

Chorus 

I'm sick of knockin I'm sick of clocking 
I'm sick of droppin in a hole never reaching my goal 
It's got my soul seperated into pieces 
It just increases 
I'm hit wit anger like a cooked tit wit hot greases 
So if you understood my attitude 
Maybe you feel what I'm feeling 
And then it start appealing 
To ya intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations 
Death by temptations even got my heart basting 
So I'm tracing the line where I can find a better path 
And make it last sit back and laugh before the aftermath 
The tragic flaw is what makes it raw 
So let it fall and I'll get through it even if I have to crawl 
My way, I see the sun and there's no delay 
And I'ma pray cause the lord will make a brighter day 
Or will he keep me in his holding cell 
But enough wit the questions the only story to tell 
is that I'm
