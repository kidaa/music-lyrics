Chorus:



Kill 'em all x4

cuz everybody dyin' on this muthafuckin' album

Kill 'em all x4

don't kick up in the dirt when i'm puttin' in work

Kill 'em all x4

cuz everybody dyin' on this muthafuckin' album



I murda like this this

I murda like that that

pull an ak-47 up out my muthafuckin' gangsta hat

professinal, columiban, necktiea, barbwire

strangula, over killa, dead fuckin' body hanga

peepin' out the window with an ak

pullin' up on these coppas 

helicoptas, squad cars, squat 10's with choppas

they tellin' me ";nigga, get the fuck out before ya die

if you surrender, we'll make sure that you quickly fry";

should i kick open the door and go to war

or should i stick my throat

leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note

hallucinations of seein' lynched bodies burnin'

and all the po-po had faces like Mark Furhman

tear gas through my glass window pane

they wanna put me back up in the nut house again

but I'm not goin' back and take my prozac

they can keep the straight jacket

and leave a straight mutha fuckin' jack

a straight mutha fuckin' jack

a straight mutha fuckin' jack



Chorus



Get the hell off my dick, i'm 1990-sick

1990-sick x4



Nigga's to pull the lynch

yayo case and stick

Marcia Clark screamin' out murda, jumpin' on Oj's dick

muthafuckas still sufferin' and healin'

some high tech knowledga white boys blew up the fuckin' fed buildin'

crazy niggas still bangin' and slangin' crack

to the death, when the game put 'em up on they back

muthafuckas catchin' names, from shootin' high

and phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block

and I ain't changed much, hell

i'm still smokin' four or five muthafuckin' choppas before it's twelve

muthafuckas think they know me, but they don't know

i'm sellin' first class tickets to the murda show

don't wanna rap about no nigga, let's get it on

bustin' domes, buck shots through your rib bone

so all you niggas up in the magazines talkin' shit

get off my dick, i'm 1990-sick



Chorus



Muh-uh-mobbin' up out the cu-uh-cut

with a ready to pow one

nuh-uh-90 sick content of the album

If there's a cure for this, don't cure me

I'm comin' with the fury

playa hata's gettin' hung up like a jury

so peep the game from an old school G you know so well

the east bay gangsta, leaving caution tape and faces pale

I bails on a full moon like the 12 o clock 

neighborhood watch scared to look and see who on the block

just fed a rallys, no po-po come around here

cuz it's a different time, different game, different year

1990 sick



Chorusx2

Get the hell off my dick, i'm 1990-sick

1990-sick x4
