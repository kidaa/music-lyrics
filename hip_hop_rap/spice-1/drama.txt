Kokane 
Ah yeah... 

Spice 1 
Murder is a part of the game and the jealous got me strapped 
Crunch nappy sack, sick homies who got my back 
Dead bodies, handcuffs, and house rage 
Two and the one up on that dope track, sportin gangsta brains 
Me and my homies feelin bail up in the hooptie 
with the fifth degree in Martin, the car ain't startin 
Some haters rolled up fo' deeper than the Chevy 
Wavin Techs up in the air like Machine-Gun Kelly 
I tell all my partners to bail up out the bucket 
One raised the clout and the other gettin ducked quick 
enough, been rough so I begin to bust, straight dome shots 
droppin got them shakin like they cop lockin 
Ski skirt clout smokin down the street 
with his player partner beatin up at these niggas up in the other seat 
I check myself see if I'm shot, but they don't hit me 
Shoppers singin like Whitney they wanna fit me 
With a Full Metal Jacket, but they don't get me 
Not one bullet touch my body, not even nick me 
We rushed my homie to the nearest Carsa hospital 
But it's too late he all felt stiff like a pop sickle damn! 

Chorus w/variations: Kokane 
Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
I don't give a fuck about you 
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 

Spice 1 
We shipped this spot for homicide, heat emergency 
Feelin go perform my own open heart surgery 
Because my partner shouldn't died like that 
We gotta show my homie love and get them busters back 
So we mobb through the ghetto lookin for revenge 
But we can't find a soul, fools talkin bout us gettin cold 
Behold a Chevy with gold deeds 
could these be the headers who made my hooptie look like Swiss cheese 
Fools musta turned the lights off and let's get closer 
Don't let em see you pull your mask down, pull out the Dullja's 
With tales from the creepin on the hush feelin leave fo' suckers in a dutch 
The midnight drama don't stop so if you get some dirt 
they'll dig you in the clear, cause player, you'll be outta here 
We ain't no suckers, we doin it like John Gottie 
We left them fools in the parkin lot with open bodies 

Chorus w/variations: Kokane 
Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
I don't give a fuck about you 
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 

Spice 1 
We built up out the scene with out a clue 
People call the police but that's all they can do 
We hit the freeway in a bucket, feelin no remorse 
We regulatin in the ghetto with deadly force 
And ain't nobody tellin nothin about the decease 
Cause if you snitch your family count will get decrease 
up in the game them things gonna be poppin ya, 187 in the style of the Mafia 
This ain't no business for busters, trick ass haters 
Try their pager, jealous cause you livin major 
Hit me on my pager, sharp as a razor 
And suckers who don't feel me, get the Red Laser 
And sicker than a hangover, fools try to slang boulders 
but get snatched out their Range Rovers 

Chorus w/variations: Kokane 
Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
I don't give a fuck about you 
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop to test me 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
Now I don't give a fuck about you 
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
Now I don't give a fuck about you 
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah! 
Situations gotta stick, drama, I don't give a fuck about you, yeah 
Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me 
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah!
