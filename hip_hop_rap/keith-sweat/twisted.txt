Oh yeah baby 
You got to make your mind up 
Yeah, Kut Klose, help me out 

1 - 	You know you are my lover 
	You got me twisted over you 
	I know I got what you need 
	So what you wanna do 

Baby, baby I know 
Baby I love you so 
But you don't feel like I do 
Tell me what can I do 

2 - 	But I gotta be strong 
	Did me wrong 
	When I thought that we were really down 
	So you say you want me 
	Make up your mind 
	Cuz I'm not gonna be here for long 

Repeat 1 

Baby, baby in time 
Baby I know you'll find 
That what you need and what's here 
Think about it my dear 

Repeat 2 

Repeat 1 

Breaking up now 
You got me twisted 
Thinking about the way that things use to be 
When It was you and me girl I was so free 
See you had my heart from the start 
Like Cupid and I was just down right foolish and stupid 
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches 
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate 
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back 
Because my heart is where your love is at 
You got me twisted 

Repeat 1
