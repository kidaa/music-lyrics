[Intro] 
What, you're not feelin' me no more? 
Seems no matter what I do, heh 
You're never satisfied 
No matter what I do baby 
What's up? 
Is there someone else? 
C'mon, tell me 

Lately I been 
I been stressin' 
Girl, just wonderin' 
Why I can't get through to you 
Is there someone else? 
Do you wanna be by yourself? 
This is heartfelt 
Tell me what you wanna do, c'mon 

No matter what I do baby 
You seem to act real shady 
Everything I do 
Never seems to satisfy you 
I'm about to wild out 
Got me trippin', no doubt 
No matter what I do 
Never seems to satisfy you 

Since I put you on 
Your girlfriends wanna hang 
Before you got with me 
You didn't have a damn thing 
Girl walked in the house 
Three girls in the mall 
Ask you where you been 
Said don't question you, you know you wrong 

Never trip girl, let you live your live 
Never tripped on you 
But you're in the streets all day, all night 
You must think I'm a fool 
Pagin' me to break you off my dough 
Break you off my dough 
If you're foolin' around, don't think that I don't know 
Think that I don't know 

No matter what I do baby 
You seem to act real shady 
Everything I do 
Never seems to satisfy you 
I'm about to wild out 
Got me trippin', no doubt 
No matter what I do 
Never seems to satisfy you 

Now you know I really wanted you baby 
Didn't ask a lot of you lady 
Gave you, girl, all my time 
And all you did was play with my mind 
Now you wanna act like you all that 
But believe you'll be runnin' right back 
You know what you're doin' is foul 
Now girl, I'm 'bout to get buckwild 

No matter what I do baby 
You seem to act real shady 
Everything I do 
Never seems to satisfy you 
I'm about to wild out 
Got me trippin', no doubt 
No matter what I do 
Never seems to satisfy you
