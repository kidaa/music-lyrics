Mmm
Oh yeah 
Mmm 
Mmm, mmm, mmm 
Yeeeeeeah 

What is this 
That I'm feelin' deep inside 
Emptiness 
Girl, I see it in your eyes 
A choice to make 
Will it be me or will it be you? 
Let's be honest with each other 
There's one thing I don't wanna do 

I don't wanna play no games 
I don't wanna play games with you 
If you wanna leave, just leave 
Leave me, yes I'm gonna miss you 
If you're not serious 
Don't wanna waste no time 
If you'll be better off without me 
Then I'll be better off without you 

Tried to make it last, two damn years 
Just couldn't get things right 
Crazy love, up and down 
Guilty conscience all the time 
Tired of games we play 
Got to turn this thing around 
Inside I know you feel the same 
I can see clearly now, yeah 
It's been a long time comin' 
See girl, some things must come to an end 
And I don't wanna lose a friend, no 
I don't, I don't wanna lose a friend 

I don't wanna play no games 
I don't wanna play games with you 
If you wanna leave, just leave 
Leave me, yes I'm gonna miss you 
If you're not serious 
Don't wanna waste no time 
If you'll be better off without me 
Then I'll be better off without you 

Baby I never meant to break you down 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
Seems like we always had to fool around 
Baby, I know girl, I know 
Breakin' up is so damn hard to do 
So damn hard to do 
And I don't wanna lose a friend, no 
I don't wanna lose the best thing I ever had 

I don't wanna play no games 
I don't wanna play games with you 
If you wanna leave, just leave 
Leave me, yes I'm gonna miss you 
If you're not serious 
Don't wanna waste no time 
If you'll be better off without me 
Then I'll be better off without you 

I don't wanna play no games 
Tell your mama you are comin' home 
If you wanna leave, just leave 
Tell your daddy you did me wrong 
If you're not serious 
See I know you're not serious about this thing 
If you'll be better off without me 
But it's alright 
Then I'll be better off without you 
It's alright 

I don't wanna play no games 
I don't wanna play games with you 
If you wanna leave, just leave 
Leave me, yes I'm gonna miss you 
If you're not serious 
Don't wanna waste no time 
If you'll be better off without me 
Then I'll be better off without you
