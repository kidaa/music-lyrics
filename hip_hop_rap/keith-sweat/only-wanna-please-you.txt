Never made you cry 
Never told you lies 
I was there when you needed me 
When chips were down 
Who stayed around? 
Better recognize 
Nobody but me 
What size you need? 
Come and let me feed 
You love so we can grow 
So close together, go through any weather 
I only live just to please you 
So stop playin' boo 

Cuz I want you 
There's nothing I won't do 
Girl I gotta have you 
I thought you knew 
How bad I need you 
And I'll go 
I'll go that extra mile 
I only live to please you 

What must I do 
To prove to you 
That I'm the one 
You should give your love to 
It'd be a mistake 
If you don't take 
All of the love 
That I've tried to give 

I'm at your service 
So don't be nervous 
I'll never do any wrong to you 
My only reason 
My only purpose 
On this earth is to please you 
So stop playin' boo 

Cuz I want you 
There's nothing I won't do 
Girl I gotta have you

How bad I need you 
And I'll go 
I'll go that extra mile 
I only live to please you 

My only reason here on this earth 
Is to treat you right 
Make you feel real good 
Just like a woman should 
Let me do my job 
Make your heart throb 
Only for me baby, yeah, yeah, yeah 

There's no other purpose that I'm here for 
Baby but to love you 
Won't you stop frontin' boo
