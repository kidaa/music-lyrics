[Busta] 
Keith Sweat, Busta Rhymes 
Rah Digga, Flipmode 
On fire now! 
I love to stand up in corners 
With thugs, holdin' it down 
Or be in golf courses 
Sippin' on somethin' poly and contract 
Love to floss heavy with shine for that ass 
I love to hit and drop bombs right on top of that ass 
Wassup 
I like to watch my whole crew break bread 
We thug marraige, select chicks 
Give me this head 
??, stack for my crew 
Not whips, it's just some of the wild shit 
That I be lovin' to do 
Wassup 

[Keith] 
Girl it's gettin' 'round 
Heard you wanna get down 
Find out for yourself 
How I really put it down 
And maybe since you're curious 
Take a ride and find out what 
I do to make you fall 
Deep in love 
It's the things I do 

[Keith] 
The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love 

The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love 

[Keith] 
One night 
Is all I need to make you see 
Two nights 
Why don't you come home with me 
And I'll give you everything your body needs 
Mya, Mya, Mya, Mya 
I want you to see 

[Mya] 
Lemme get my handcuffs 
Baby put your hands up 
Lemme get my blindfold 
Gotta keep your eyes closed 
We got all night 
Comin' three or four times 
So many things I wanna do 

[Keith] 
The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love 

The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love 

[Rah Digga] 
Yeah, I like to keep heads guessin' 
Give 'em a test and 
Blow they whole mind if I find 'em interestin' 
Best in the business 
Lyrics came as a blessin' 
Why you be on the block 
Tryna guess who I'm sexin' 
Cool type of mami like Thug Castradami 
Take a few years to get near the punani 
Now, see me with a apple or vanilla Martini 
While I get the biggest kicks 
Outta chicks tryna be me 

[Keith] 
So many things so many things, so many things 
So many things so many things, oh yes we are 
So many things so many things, so many things 
So many things so many things, so many things 

The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love 

The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love 

[Mya] 
Lemme get my handcuffs 
Baby put your hands up 
Lemme get my blindfold 
Gotta keep your eyes closed 
We got all night 
Comin' three or four times 
So many things I wanna do 

[Keith] 
The things I do, the 
Diamonds I wear, the 
Bentley, I drive 
And the things I do 
When we're makin' love
