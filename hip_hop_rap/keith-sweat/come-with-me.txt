Yeah, what I want you to do tonight 
Is turn your the stereo up real loud 

Now for all the fellas out there gettin their groove on 
And for all the ladies out there gettin on with the groove 
This one goes out to you, yeah 

Would you mind 
If I kiss your lips a thousand times 
Would you mind 
And baby would you mind 
If I could just sit here 
Take my time 
Would you mind 
Oh, baby 

1 - 	Come with me 
	To a place where no love has gone before 
	Come with me 
	To a place where no love has gone before 

Would you mind 
If I run my fingers through your hair, baby 
Would it show you how much I care 
And would you mind 
If I made you scream my name out loud, babe 
The thought of it just drives me wild 

Repeat 1 

Come and go with me 
Girl then you will see 
I wanna love you now 
Make your body spin around and around and around and around 

Repeat 1 until fade
