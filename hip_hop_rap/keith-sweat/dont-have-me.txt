Got a house on the hill 
Ten cars in your driveway 
And you never seem to look my way 
Cuz I could feel your pain 

So you got a college degree 
You might have a PHD 
So you drive a GS3 
But it don't matter to me 
Everynight you cry yourself to sleep 
Mmm, cuz you're so lonely 

[Keith and Dave] 
You may have money 
You may have cars 
But you ain't had shit 
'Til you've been in my arms 
You don't have a thing 
Still you don't have me 
Baby

A Bentley Coupe you ain't even drove yet 
Everyday you go home alone, yes you do 
I know it's wrong, yeah

Everynight you cry yourself to sleep 
Cry yourself, alright, cuz you're so lonely
