[Intro]
Goddamn I look good 
Somebody slap me, huh 
This club does not want 2 point 2 seconds of me 
But I'mma give it to 'em anyway, uh 

When I walk in the door, niggas be like "yo" 
Stare me up and down even when they with they ho 
It amazes me them niggas don't care 
All fade tight, ass everywhere 
And before I can even get a chance to blink 
Wild mutha-fuckas start sendin' me drinks 
But I send 'em all back, cuz I got my own loot 
Suit? It's a Miaki 
Boots? Gianni Versace 
It ain't hard to see 
I got my own money, don't fuck with me 
Can't touch me, check my steeze 
Swap meet bitches, please, for real 

1 - 	[Keith] Strings 
	Cold... Blooded 
        When I walk in the room, all eyes on me 
        Let me get your number 
        Got ice on my hands, ice on my feet 

        Cold... Blooded 
        When I walk in the room, all eyes on me 
        What more can I say? 
        And these are the sounds they be makin' at me, say what 

[Strings] 
Uh uh, yeah yeah 
Uh uh, yeah yeah 

Uh, picture me Strings, Pav diamonds in my ear 
I push a new somethin' every year 
Hip Hop sweetheart, nigga pleaser 
Coochie value, like the Mona Lisa 
99 escalade, smellin' like Chanel 
Bumpin' my shit, on the way to Bloomingdale's 
For a shopping spree, niggas jocking me 
Black tale centerfold, no stopping me 
And your bitch is jealous cuz I'm gettin' 
While and you out the first to tell her 
I won't tell her, I'm hella plus she getting dumber and dumber 
Cuz while she was in the dressing room, he slipped me his number 
And said call me baby, you're a real lady 
Workin' those Girbaud, spittin' flows at shows 
I check the videos and the skills 
Can I get your autograph on the 50 dolla bill, for real? 

Repeat 1 

[Strings] 
Uh uh, yeah yeah 
Uh uh, yeah yeah 

Freeze 

Yo, I got a fat boy on my jock 
Nigga got a wife but he got a fat knot 
'Member when it was hot, rollin' down the block 
In my summer car, 320 E drop 
Tell the wife get it together, she ain't cute 
Rockin' that sweater with them daisy dukes 
And that nigga know it 
That's why he with the fat tale poet 
Spittin' game like a nigga sayin', baby pass me Moet, for real 

Repeat 1 

[Strings] 
Uh uh, yeah yeah 
Uh uh, yeah yeah 

Repeat 1 without Strings 

Repeat 1 to fade
