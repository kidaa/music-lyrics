Tell me why is it that 
You have no trust in me 
When I go out at night 
You're always paging me 
You just wanna believe 
That I've been messing 'round 
With every young chick from here 
On the other side of town 

Listening to your so-called friends 
You don't even trust your man 
I might as well be doing wrong 
Cause every night when I get home

You looking at me strange 
Last night you even asked me why all my sheets changed 
I caught you reading names off of my caller id 
Do you think I'm a freak 
Cause you don't have no trust in me 

Listening to your so-called friends 
I don't think you understand 
I got same ones all up in your face 
They in here tryna take your place
