[Intro - Lil' Mo] Keith 
Mmm People think it's easy out here 
You know, they see us in the fancy cars 
Fly clothes oh yes they do 
A little bling to wear, nahmean? 
Well, it's not easy 
You have all that, ain't got nobody to share it with 
Oh no Been tryin' to find somebody, it's crazy oh no 

[Keith] 
If I go to the club 
They just wanna take me home 
Just tryin' to have a good time 
Just wanna get my drink on 
If I go to the mall 
They come in the store 
I'm just tryin' to chill 
Said I'm just tryin' to chill 

[Lil' Mo] Keith 
I don't know if they think 
This is the glamorous life oh yes they do 
They wanna share the life with me yeah, yeah, yeah 
But what's a girl who gave all of her up in the lights oh, lights 
It won't lead to anything yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Keith and Lil' Mo] 
I'll trade a million bucks 
For someone's love who don't come with a price 
I'll trade in all my cars 
For someone who will love me for life 

They can take away my platinum plaques 
Leave me broke, it won't mean a thing 
I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone 
Who will love me just for me 

[Lil' Mo] 
Gotta change my phone 
Cuz they call my crib 
Just want some privacy 
Just tryin' to live 
If I'd have known 
It woulda been this way 
Woulda found a man a long time ago 

Don't get me wrong 
I'm still young and I'm not hating but 
It's not as easy as it seems whoa oh 
Cuz I'm not out here looking for a hit and run 
I want someone who can love me for me

Leave me broke, it won't mean a thing 
I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone

Sometimes it's just not right 
And sometimes you win 
But even then
