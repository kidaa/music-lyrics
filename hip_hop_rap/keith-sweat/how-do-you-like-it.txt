Yo here we go-Left Eye flow 
What's up! Baby you can skinny dip in my left lip sip a little cat 
Nip eat my punanna, monanna and the little banana split get a little top notch 
Play somebody's hopscotch watch as I land in my man's crotch 
Now there's a crew in perusin' what I'm doin' I wouldn't want to ruin 
You and who you knew but as I'm rollin' 
Through your exes with my triple O 
I'm yellin' tic tac toe from the waist below Yo! 
You say tomatoes I say tomatoes so pick up on my lead and lick on those toes 
Me and my kitty cat is wearin' a hat to the throne so baby take us to the endzone 
I'm catching 80 in my shady to the top nickle I'm the lady goin' crazy on your popsicle 
And as we come a little closer to the end of the game 
You know I'm taking all the sweat out your name 

[Keith]: 
Jam, how do you like it baby, jam 
Come on don't you want to jam 
I want to know baby jam

Don't you want to jam
