Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
Never, never, never thought I would 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
Never, never, never, never thought that I 
Oh no, not me 
It's a shame that she 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
Oh, yes it is, yes it is, yes it is, oh 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 

Always considered myself a playa 
Got a lot to talk about 
Never thought I'd get caught up in this mess 
See I had a good life 
My own home, my own car, my own dough 
Had no stress 
Let me tell you the story 
And then I let my guard down for a minute 
Cuz she was pretty 
Thought she was the one for me 
Do you hear me? 
Knew it was wrong, shouldn't have did it 
But she let me hit it 
And I was too damn blind to see 
Just what she was doin' to me 

Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
I wonder if anybody out there can understand, oh 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
I wonder if anybody out there has ever been caught up 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
Not me, baby, not me 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 

Now she's on the phone 
Callin' all her family and friends 
Tellin' them she's wifey 
And I told her ass from the beginning 
I'm not ready to be settled 
That's not the way it's goin' down with me 
But oh, she had her game so tight 
The way she threw it on me everynight 
Nothin' seemed to matter 
I didn't care 
But she had it planned in the back of her head 
That she only knew 
And she played it out, until the bitter end 
Oh no, no, no, no 

Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
I wonder how many out there understand 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
I wonder how many of you have ever been caught up 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
See, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
No, no, no 

One day she knocked on my door 
With a letter in her hand 
And she gave it to me 
And said "I know you'll understand" 
And as I read the letter 
Tears began to stream from my eyes 
She said she lost her baby 
And the baby was mine, oh mine 

Why, why, why did this happen to me? 
Tell me why 
Why, why, why did this happen to me? 
I wanna know why 
Why, why, why did this happen to me? 
Did this happen to me 
This is not the way it's supposed to be 
It wasn't supposed to be this way 
Tell me why, why, why did this happen to me? 
Did this happen to me 
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why 

Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, yeah 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
Oh, no, no 
She said she lost her baby 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
And the baby was mine 
Oh no, not me 
What am I supposed to do? 
What am I supposed to do? 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
What am I supposed to do? 
What am I supposed to do? 

It was supposed to be a temporary thing 
Oh no, not me 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
Yeah, yeah, yes it was 
Oh no, not me 
I'm so caught up 
Never thought I'd be caught up 
I'm so caught up
