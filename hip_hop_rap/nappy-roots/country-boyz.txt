[B. Stille]
Uhhh.. this nigga no games games
With my Hanes tee shirt, with a pic and roll chain chain...
Doo-rag, heavy blue 'Lac - 85 South, don't drive it too fast too fast
My niggaz don't roll no billies,
get a big box of them brown Dutches brown Dutches
We don't want no brand new Cartel
Brandon lemme get them keys to the Cutlass Cutlass
Represent for the M-I-L, the A-T-L, the Macktown Macktown
Stay smokin that smackdown, keep myself a little half pound half pound
You know B. Stille in the cut, on the back po'ch Jig drillin it up
Black folks just livin it up, court next week not givin a fuck!
What's up Grown standin - only rap to them grown women grown women
Stay high, we'll play shy, least till I can get home wittem
Shorty whattchu thinkin Whattchu drinkin - thinkin it is what it ain't
I cain't be trickin, so don't be trippin, thinkin I can't when I cain't
Come on..

Nigga hooked it up, like the waitress from the IHOP
Nothin but the grits, steak, and egg with that
waitin for the five dollar pancake, front-back side to side
Them polly country boy, Cadillac, cat sick in the multi-color
All clean twenty inches at the seam plenty chickens
Get the green spit the swishers at the Beam shit done seem
Craziest muh'fucker, what y'all niggaz do for cream
Never knock the hustle scheme, only what the cheddar bring
Hate, fake-niggaz, hoes, envy, greed, jealousy
Cain't hate, what a nigga make, type of enemies
Smilin in my face but they really ain't no friend to me
Cain't wait, send em eight straight nine milli-mee
Aww hell naw, y'all niggaz ain't feelin me!
Colt 45 e'rytime like Billy D
Ninety-five  leave through Tennessee
Quarter pound with the chron' fuckin wit my memory
