[SKINNY DEVILLE]
feelin easy like its sunday morning steak and eggs
hey livin off some big rims lookin like some blades
play her like a pimp type a nigga aint me
with the tint the 35 percent so ya cant see
fish scales shotgun pass the "L" to big V
flip flop candy lookin so wet it drip drop shiiiine
from the tip top chrome double duce
make a bitch stop jaw drop ballin off this hip hop
on a budget back and forth from kentucky
we them type of niggas that crack corn in a bucket
a hundred and ninety spoke god damn
look but dont touch it we commin down I-65
nappy and company vertical grills on the cadilac we so real
skinny deville return like a bat out of hell
hell dont ya think nappy roots comin as well
Big V, B. Stille, Prophet, Clutch, and Fish Scales yeaahh

[CHORUS]
My ride be sittin on dem hundred spokes hundred spokes
my candy paint straight from the honeycomb honeycomb
wood grain interior leather and chrome leather and chrome

[FISH SCALES]

[CHORUS]

[B. STILLE.]

gas up the crotch rocket pass up the cops blocked it
hey B. Stille can I role with you and Prophet
extra clean you cant tell me nean
drop the top showin off for the summa 
the cadilac stretch on dem bow legged stillets
where the candy paint sets like a wet cigarette
bubble coat primers chrome spiders inside us
big enough for my team and a couple of trainers
but it hold no minors thats major 
wood grain and ya get deep beaters big features 
feel boom from the beats in my big speakers
its on in my seats and my signature
dont throw dirt on my name no shirt as I lean
out the window pane you hear the country boy sang

[CHORUS]
