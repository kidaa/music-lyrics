VERSE 1:
GIRL WHERE IS OUR CHILD
SENT HIM TO YOUR MOTHER'S 
FOR A WHILE
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONE
YOU KNOW I SENT THEM HOME
GIRL I LIVE FOR YOU 
SO I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE NEWS
SO PLEASE TURN OFF THE T.V.
AND IF YOU GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME
I WANNA HEAR YOU MOAN
CHORUS:
LET'S BE ALONE
I WANNA HEAR YOU MOAN
LET'S BE ALONE
SO WE CAN GET IT ON
LET'S BE ALONE
VERSE 2:
BETTER THAN YOU AND ME
BETTER THAN A DAMN MOVIE
OUR LOVE IS SO MUCH FUN
LET'S DO SOME FREAKY SHIT
AND THEN I'LL MAKE YOU CUM
NOTHING COMPARES TO US
I LOVE WE HAVE SO MUCH TRUST 
TELL ME CAN YOU SEE
I WAS MADE FOR YOU AND YOU FOR ME
I WANNA HEAR YOU MOAN
