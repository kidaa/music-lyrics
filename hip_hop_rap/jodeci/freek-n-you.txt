Freek 'N You
I wanna freak you repeat X8
Everytime I close my eyes
I wake up feelin' so horny
I can't get you outta my mind
sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
freek'n you is all I see
bridge:
tonight, I need your body
tonight, you got my time
tonight you won't be sorry
tonight, you got my mind
you got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you
chorus:
what must I say
what must I do
to show how much
I think about freek'n you
what must I say
what must I do
to show how much
I think about freek'n you
oooh, I could go on for days
but I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
but it wouldn't last 'cause I'm a freak
turned on by everything you say
I'm turned on by everything you do
and at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you
tonight, I need your body
tonight, you got my time
tonight, you won't be sorry
tonight you got my mind
what must I say
what must I do
to show how much
I think about freek'n you
what must I say
what must I do
to show how much
I think about freek'n you
freek out
and freek me up and down
