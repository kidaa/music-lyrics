It's been so long
since I touched a lady
and I'm still waiting
for you to come back to me
now will you forgive me
for the wrong I've done
and let's try again
to make it last so long
chorus:
I'm still waiting
for you to come back to love
to fulfill this life
we're dreaming of
so don't wait
another day might be too long
don't rush
go slow so nothing goes wrong
listen baby
I can't wait
to feel your love again
cause you can stop this pain
that I've been feeling
so let's start all over
and put the past behind
and make a love to stand
to the test of time
I'm still waiting
for you to come back to love
to fulfill this life, yeah
we're dreaming of
and these feelings are so very strong
another day might be too long
go slow so nothing goes wrong
I just can't take it no more, baby
the feel of your warm embrace, baby
I'm still waiting on you
I'm still waiting
for you to come back to love ohhh, yes I am
to fulfill this life that we're dreaming of
we're dreaming of
so baby, please don't wait, baby baby
another day might be too long my arms are open wide
go slow so nothing goes wrong
sometimes I get so lonely wanna call you, baby
just a little love is all I need
yeahhhhh
another day might be too long
go slow so nothing goes wrong
just a little love is all I need my arms are open wide
just a little love is all I need

the feel of your warm embrace
I'm still waiting
for you to come back to love
to fulfill this life

repeat chorus until fade
