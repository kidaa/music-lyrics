Promises you made me
all the things you told me
you said you'd never leave me
we'll be together for eternity
now it's all in the past
now I know our love will last
lady I will do all I can
lady I will be all I am
I'll give you all you had before
so come on in and close the door
let me show you what I could be
could you just please tell me
chorus:
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
I know that things are rough
but my faith wasn't strong enough
now my heart is built to last
my heart is beating for you fast
but now I know that you understand
I wanna take you by the hand
and walk with you down that aisle
and with you I will live my life
I'll give you all you had before
so come on in and close the door
let me show you what I could be
if you just please tell me
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
I want you to know that it's for real
this feeling that I feel
I want you to know that it's so real
tell me will you
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
do you believe in love
and the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
cause your love is why I live
