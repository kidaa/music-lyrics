[Chorus:]
I'll be the bridge you can use to
I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountain tops
Together we'll walk over the bridge 

[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
There's a place where you can go
Lay your head down comfortable
And it's always there for sure
Dont you know
And it comes as no surprise
The mountains that you must climb
Sit back don't run away have no shame 
There's no wrong there's no wrong 
There's no rightno right 
It's only you and how you your treat life 
See baby if the road you choose 
Dont work out for you 
You know you know I'll be your rescue, 
Suga Suga 

[Chorus:]
I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountain tops
Together we'll walk over the bridge 

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
Like a diamond shining bright
See you are young and flying high
Big dreams of having thangs, in your eyes do dop do dop hey
You thought it was making cash
But uh that small means never last 
How'd ya throw it all away here me say 

[Hook:]
Let me take yo far away
Be sure to find your destiny
And you know without a doubt 
That I would be your bridge out 

I'll be the
And I will
I'll be the 

[Chorus:]
I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountain tops
Together we'll walk over the bridge 

[Chorus:]
I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountain tops
Together we'll walk over the bridge
