[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
Hooo, Hooo,
Sitting on the stairway
Hoping that your ok
Waiting patiently for you to comeback to me
What should I do
I dont mind the waiting 
As long as there's still maybe
A possilbilty, for you to be true to me
I'll be sitting, on the stairway, til a quater till two
With nothing to do baby hey yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and wait 

[Chorus:]
Killing time, waiting on you
What should I do
I'll be seating here wating
Killing time, waiting on you
What should I do
I'll be seating here wating 

Look inside your mirror
I hope that you see clearer
Look behind yourself
And you will find me
I've got your back baby
The love I have Im saving
I'll be there for you
Just like I said I'll be
I'll be sitting, on the stairway, til a quater till three
With nothing to do ba-by
But twiddle my thumbs and wait
[Chorus]

[Hook:]
Oh, baby when you comeback down
Go home get the love you found in me
I know that your gonna take time
Oh remember Im by yourside
Dont worry Im down for you
No matter what you're going through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby,

[Chorus until end]
