You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 

[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
Boy I know you want me 
I can see it in your eyes 
But you keep on frontin' 
Won't you say what's on your mind 
Cause each and every time you near me 
You give me signs 
But when I ask you what's the deal 
You hold it all inside 
If you wanna be with me 
You gotta keep it real 
Tell me what's goin' on 
Tell me how you feel 
Cause boy I know you want me 
Just as much as I want you 
So come and get my love 
It's all here for you 

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
If you keep actin' this way 
You're gonna lose my love 
I ain't got no time to play 
You better to be playin hurry up
Cause every time I come around 
Cruse around your way 
I see you on the corner 
But you don't know what to say 
When I walk up to you baby 
You seem so shy 
What's the problem baby 
Never had a girl like I 
I can see right through you 
And you know you wanna be mine 
So get your act together 
Cause you're running out of time 

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
You say yes
You wont regret 
I must confess, I'm really feelin you
Anything you've ever wanted before
Is right here for you, for you
Dont worry what they say 
Just bring you're love away
Cause your friends cant do what i can for you
I dont wanna hear you saynooo
Baby tell me yes yeees
tell me Yes, Dont tell me noo
[Chorus until end]
