I gave my heart to you 
I gave up my friends like you said I should do
Put aside my smile for you 
Threw out my dreams if you said you didn't approve
I gave my mind, compromise my life just to see I'd find
you were trying hold me back slowly you throwing me off my track
Disappointed again

[Chorus:]
I'm through with love, I'm through with it, through with love,
Through with it, I'm through with love, I'm through with it, 
I'm through with love,
I'm finally giving it up,
I have given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm I'm through with love, I'm through with it, through with love,
I'm finally giving it up

Oh, there you go, comparing me,
to every little model on the tv screen,
oh there you go, complaining to me, cause I wanna spend time with my family,
My esteem has gone down,
You never wanna take me out,
You make me feel dumb, And alone
I don't know where to go. 
I'm through with it

[Chorus]

I shared all my secrets with you 
Even when it hurt to have told the truth
Paralyze my growth for you
I gave you control that felt so helpless without you
Couldn't be your friend
To anyone happy cause with you see
Misery loves company 
You know this is love 
If this is love I don't want it any more

[Chorus]

Why do I feel so empty?
I'm crying out for some stability 
You destroy my many insecurities
I'm breaking down somebody pray for me
Need a love like no other not an ordinary love.
Restore my joy, wisdom, and courage lord I need your love

I found a new love; I found a new, found a new love 
I finally found it in God
I've  given so much in the past past 
For a love I always had had
I found a new, I found a new love, I found a new love, 
I found a new, found a new love 
I finally found it in god
