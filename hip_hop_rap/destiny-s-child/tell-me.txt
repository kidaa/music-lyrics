[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
Why dont you just admit it
Cause I dont need your graditude
And dont you try to hide it
Just tell me the truth
I cant go on this way looking for something that isnt there
Should I be on my way
Because I need a reason for this mess 

[Chorus:]
Tell me if you dont love me anymore
Just tell me, if you dont care bout me anymore
Just tell me, if you dont want it,just tell me Tell me 

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
I never thought this day would come

But a test of love I need from you
Honesty's always seen through eyes
I wish you would believe
Im giving you my all but it's not pleasingyou're distant heart
If you respect my love you'll hear my plea
[Chorus]

[Guitar break]
Do do do do do do do do do 
la la la la la la la la la 

Tell me if you dont love me anymore
Just tell me, if you dont care bout me anymore
Just tell me, if you dont want it,just tell me Tell me
