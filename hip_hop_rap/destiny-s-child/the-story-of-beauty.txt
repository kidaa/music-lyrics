Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize 
Your beauty

It was a Saturday
This cold afternoon
Inside this house there lived a frightened young girl
She didn't know what she should do
Cuz she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone with her step father

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize 
Your beauty

He touched her places 
That he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her
That he shouldn't have done
So she ran into her room
Paged her mother 9-1-1 
And the tragedy began 
For this young girl

She told her mother, her family, and friends
No one believed her cuz before this happened
She was filled with hate and anger
Towards her step father
Cuz he took her mother from her when they married

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize 
Your beauty

She looked for her father
in the men that she saw 
Thought that all she had to offer
Was her body
No one to figure out why
This young girl would live her life
In such pain and unhappiness
She was so beautiful

She rebelled and one day the young girl fell in love with another man like her stepdad
He abused her emotionally and made her feel like she was worthless
Hope one day she realize
And see the beauty in her eyes
All she needs is prayer and strength
She's beautiful

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize 
Your beauty

Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize 
Your beauty

Don't hold your head down low
You've got so much, so much, so much, so much, so much to be proud of
You can still live your life
I promise you you'll survive
Girl I love you
You're beautiful
