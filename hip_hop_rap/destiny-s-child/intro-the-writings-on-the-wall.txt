[Kelly:] 
LeToya Barzini I wanna thank you 
For having you organize 
This meeting here today

[LeToya:] And Kelly Steracki I also want to thank you 
And all the other 
Dons of the four families 
Beyonce Corleone, from the South West Ah, 
LaTavia Menser from the 
Four-Four

[LaTavia:] 
Our objective of this meeting today Is to discuss Destiny's Child's 
Commandments of relationships

[Kelly:] 
You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary 
For us to end up with brokenhearts

[LaTavia:] 
Yes Godfather 
Times have changed 
Relationships aren't like the old days 
You know

[LeToya:] 
See what we need is a man of his word 
All this, uh cheating, uh backstabbing, uhm hating 
No more, no more

[LaTavia:] 
But Godfather, how do we avoid all these mishaps

[Beyonce:] 
It's obvious, 
The Writing's On The Wall; 
Thou shalt not hate
