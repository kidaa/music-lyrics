[Beyonce:] 
I saw your new girlfriend the other day
And i expected for her to be so much more than she was
I checked out her style, the way she smiled
The way she moved, the things she said
The way she looked at me like, "i got yo man" 

[1]-She cant love you like i can
Her awful love just cant compare to what i have
She cant touch you like i do
Cause when y'all touching, you pretend its me and you 

And theres no way her love's as good as mine
Theres no reason for you to waist your time 

[Beyonce:] 
When we were together you told me what you didnt like
And you went out and got exactly that type
Except that your new girl is nothing compared to me
Everything that she did wrong i always did right 

[2]
She cant hold you like i can
Boy you a fool if you cant realize what you had
She cant feel you like i can
Cause im a girl thats always standin by my man 

And theres no way her loves as good as mine
Theres no reason for you to waste your time
And theres no way her loves as good as mine
Theres no reason for you to waste your time 

[Bridge:]
 theres no way, theres no way
that her love could be could be good as mine
theres no reason no reason
for you to even go and waste your time, your time 

and theres no way her loves as good as mine
theres no reason for you to waste your time
and theres no way her loves as good as mine
theres no reason for you to waste your time [repeat until fade]
