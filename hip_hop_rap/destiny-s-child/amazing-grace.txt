Amazing 
Graa-aaccee 
How Sweet- 
How sweet 
The sound- 
Sound 
That saved, saved 
A wrench 
Like 
Me I once was lost, lost yeah 
Lost 
But now Im found 
What you say girl? 
But 
Now, Im found we still cant feel you 
But 
Noooowww, Im found 
Was blind, but now I see 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And that my fears relieved 
How precious did that grace 
Appear 
The hour I first believed 
Thank you Lordy
