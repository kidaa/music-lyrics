Ooh my man my man 
He does whatever it takes to satisfy me
This man this man
He knows me inside out
My wants and my needs
His ways are so unique
The way he protects me

No House
No material thing
Could ever take him from me

Ain't no one like you
No, no, no, no

Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over
