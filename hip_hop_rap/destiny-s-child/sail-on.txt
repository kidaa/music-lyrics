[Verse 1 Beyonce and Kelly:]
Sail on down the line
But I have some money so, and I dont really wanna know
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice, you see 
Time after time, I tried, tried to hold on to what we've got
But uh, now you're going
And I dont mind about the things your going to say boy
I gave all my money and my time
I know, I know its a shame
But Im giving you back your name
Guess I'll be on my way, I wont be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
Im looking for a good time, a good time

[Verse 2 Beyonce and Kelly:]
Sail on down the line
Aint it funny how the times can go
All my friends say they told me so, but it doesnt matter
It was plain to see, that a small town girl like me just 
Wasnt your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking
I gave you my heart, and I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it aint so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Im throwin away the blues, Im tired of being used
I want everyone to know, 
Im looking for a good time, good time

[Chorus:]
Sail on,
Honey,good times never felt so good
Sail on,
Honey, goodtimes never felt so good
Sail on,
Sugar, goodtimes never felt so good

[Chorus until end]
