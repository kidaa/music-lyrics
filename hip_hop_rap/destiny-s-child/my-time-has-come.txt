[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
Its too far
Its too fast
Its to quick 
It wont last
Its not right, but it's not wrong
Theres no time, move along
But I've come much too far, and I know whats in my heart
And I know, what I feel
I can tell when it is real
It's ok, be afraid
Its alright
You just take that fear, turn it in to your strength
It's called life, and thats why we're here
Now I've come much too far, and I know whats in me heart
And I know what I feel, and this time I know its real
My time has come
And like the road below me
I know I'll touch the sky above
A million footprints surround me
Tell me it can be done, my time has come
Now I've come much too far, and I know whats in my heart
And I know, what I feel
And this time I know its real I know that I just gotta keep movin on, I know whats in my heart
My time has come

[Repeat until end]
