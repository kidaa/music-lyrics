[CHORUS:]
I know you see me watching you
and I see you watching me
cause boy your bodys callin 
and temptation is killin me
[repeat 4x]

[1:]
Im chillin at the spot and my posse's 4 deep
had my man is on my mind turn my head what did i see
the fellas lookin fly and there was one that caught my eye
so i bit my lip switched my hips as i walked by saying
sexy boy you're so fly i just might give you a try 
ima write yo number in the palm of my hand
oops i forgot i got a man

[CHORUS]

[2:]
Im thinkin to myself should i even take a chance
should i do whats on my mind or should i stay down with my man
this boy got me fienin and im wantin him so bad
should i chill one night with him and risk everything I've had
saying
sexy boy you so fly i wish i could give you a try
but my man's at home waiting for me by the phone
sorry cant get my groove on!

[CHORUS]

Temptation is callin 
Papi wantin you so bad i could cry
Relationships callin me
To do whats wrong but i gotta do right
[repeat]

[Chorus]

temptations is callin
Papi be wantin you so bad i could cry
Relationships callin me
To do whats wrong but i gotta do right

[Chorus]
