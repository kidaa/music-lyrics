[1] - [Destiny's Child]:
If you leave her, I'll leave him 
We'll pack our bags, don't say a word 
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away, oh just you and me 

[Beyonce:] I peeped him long time ago when he told me 
He's never seen the chick before 
He wouldn't give me no explanation 
Cause he knows when I pack my bags it ain't for no vacation, so 

[Destiny's Child:]
I'm gonna do my thang, 
I'm leavin' his ass alone Oh I'm gone, Oh I'm movin' on my way 
He's historyhe' history,
Too late The game is over
He'll see a girl's 
Gotta do what she's gotta do

[Repeat 1 2x]

[R.L.]
I called 612-555-2422 to find you
I packed my bags, gassed up the Jag
And I told my dad 
you're the finest girl I never had 

[Next] And so my lady, what's the message, page me
I know it might sound crazy, but say you'll be my baby 
She crushed my new Benz, 
slept with my best friend 
Spent all my ends, it's got to end 

[Beyonce] Ooh, how do I know you won't hurt me like he has I know I'm afraid he'll want me back 
[R.L.] You've gotta have faith in me you know I do I'd never play ya babe Cause my love is all right Cause my love is all you'll ever need 
[Beyonce] Cause I need someone for me 
[R.L]This love was meant to be
[Beyonce] It's our destiny
[Beyonce & R.L.]Just run away with me, oh ho

[2] - [Next] If you leave him, I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags, don't say a word 
Let's go far away, to another place 
Let's hide away, 
Oh just you and me
