[Japan bonus track]

[Beyonc:]
Chapter one
LAX departure
Flight 1106 he sat right next to me
Chapter two
He was cute so I asked him if he had a lucky lady claiming him
Chapter three
He made it clear that he was single
And he was searching for a partner just like me
Chapter four
We landed and he said we just can't end it
Cuz he needed a little more time wit me

Weeks later we datin
Taking me all kinda places
Showing me things I never seen
It was kinda crazy
I'm relating to this man so I gave him
Every hidden secret part of me

Ohooh then it switched
What is this overheard your messages
When I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin into you is that your boo
Nigga tell her I'm your main event

Why you actin like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin it
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I know all his friends
And I know its gone hurt you proving it
Why you actin like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doin it
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
After all the trips, all time we spent
And I know its gone hurt you proving it

[Kelly:]
Think I'm lying
His Mama, Mrs. Parker
And I sat down in the den and watched Comic View
Think I'm lying
His boxers
He likes to wear Calvin Klein
With the open front fly design size 32
Think I'm lying
I never could describe his birth mark
If I never did let him hit and get into this
Think I'm lying
I can even tell you your size
Cuz you left your bra behind in his bathroom

Weeks later we datin
Taking me all kinda places
Showing me things I never seen
It was kinda crazy
I'm relating to this man so I gave him
Every little secret part of me

Ohooh then it switched
What is this overheard your messages
And I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin into you is that your boo
Partner tell her I'm your main event

Why you actin like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin it
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I know all his friends
And I know its gone hurt you proving it
Why you actin like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doin it
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
After all the trips, all time we spent
And I know its gone hurt you proving it

[Michelle:]
See you makin it harder
For the other man
When a real woman
Try to let you in
Now she lookin at me
Thinkin I disrespect
But thas not my way girl cuz I wasn't raised like that
You accusing me
Should be checking him
Insecure of me
Cuz I dealt wit him
Woman to woman I ain't got time for foolishness
I'm out the door
This is my cue
I can't go through with this

Why you actin like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin it
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I know all his friends
And I know its gone hurt you proving it
Why you actin like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doin it
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
After all the trips, all time we spent
And I know its gone hurt you proving it

Why you actin like you don't know
Why you actin like you don't know
Why you actin like you don't know
Why you actin like you don't know
Why you actin like you don't know
Girl I know your man
After all the trips, all time we spent
I know its gone hurt you proving it
