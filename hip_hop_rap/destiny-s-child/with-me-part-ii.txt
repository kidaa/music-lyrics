Master P: Destiny you wanna' be with me
Howl it if you hear me
Ugh
x4

Chorus I: Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
'Cause everything he likes is with me

If I was in your shoes
I would have had to let him go
From the first sign of him tryin' to play
If he wants me to stay
You gotta' let all that go
You wanna' stick around
Not believin' what you see
Why you waitin'
Thinkin' everything's gonna' be okay
I got him right here with me

Chorus II: Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Leaves you alone
He's with me
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
Why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
'Cause everything he likes is with me

I wanna' call you so bad
And tell how you expect to mistreat him
And he still be with you
No no no no no
That's why he's here with me
I don't care what you say
You can't play with destiny

As far as I know
He's in good hands
So you can stop callin' around
Sayin'  Have you seen my man? 
Ain't no need for fuss and fight
Tryin' to make it right
Certain things ain't meant to be
And that's why that's why
He's right here with me

Master P: Be right here if you're
'Bout it 'bout it
Master P and Destiny gonna' get
Rowdy Rowdy
Howl it if your hear me
Ugh
All it takes is a beep to get near me
And mama always told me
I can tell a real girl
By the way that she hold me
I every night from the Jeep
But tonight girl
It's gonna' be you and me
Done got more ??? and ???
I need strong bearin'
She's callin' my name
Howl it
She'd never leave me
And if you really wanna' be with me
Hug me and squeeze me
Real killers like to ride
So jump it
I'm callin' this from
Front back side to side
You be precious like a flower
And if you real girl
It ain't all about the ???
But never mix business with pleasure
You really want me
Prove to me
That you'd die for whatever
Put on your soldier gear
Let's ride tonight
Thug love
Bubble bap it
Ain't no limit tonight
Girl if you wanna' be with me
Tell me you wanna' be with me
If you wanna' be with me

Chorus II
