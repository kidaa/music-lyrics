[Verse 1 Beyonce:] 
Why does love always seem so very hard
It's such a struggle to win the reward
Because I'm playin' with the wrong cards 
But I think I got the winnin' hands 
There's something different about you babe
That tells me I can 
I say it's easy for the things that I do
Never a question always a pleasure to 
Love you, love you, love you 

[Hook:]
Baby I won't say no 
The love that you give is so 
Abound and I can't let go
Of this love 

It's so natural, so natural to give my love 
It's so easy easy like second nature second nature 
It's so natural, so natural to give my love 
Like no other easy like second nature second nature 

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
Thinkin' of you is the breath that I take
Just for your love I can't wait
I could never think twice 
It wakes me up in the mornin'
And the middle of the night 
And with a smile on my face, I'm ready
[Hook]
[Chorus]
