This This, is for the old school playas, huh
the old school playas
the old school playas

It's over and done Remix
but the heartache lives on inside aaaaahhhhh
And who's the one you're clinging to
instead of me tonight tonight

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow,
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river,
That leads to your ocean To Your Ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart

It's just emotions taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world
to hold me tight
Don't cha know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
goodnight

I'm here at your side,
a part of all the things you are
and you've got a part of someone else
you goy to go find your shining star

And where are you now,
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow,
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart

It's just emotions taken me over I'm tryin' hard but I can't stop cryin'
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul inside this lonely heart
But if you don't come back I'm so excited
Come home to me, darling Come home, come home, come home
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world
to hold me tightnobody to hold me
Don't cha know there's nobody left in this world
to kiss goodnight I need you say to me
Goodnight
And where are you now,
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow,
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart hooooooooooooo oooooh

It's just emotions taken me over yeah ih yeah
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul caught in sorrow
But if you don't come back come back oooooh
Come home to me, darling don't you know that
Nobody left in this world no no
