Cleavage from here to Mexico

One hand on her hip,
When she gets wit'cha she lets it go
Nasty put some clothes on, you look to' down
Nasty don't know why you, will not sit down
Heels on her feet, swear she's in heat,
Flirtin' wit every man she sees
Her pants hangin' low,
She never says no,
Everyone knows she's easy
Nasty put some clothes on, you lookin' stain
Nasty what's your problem, you should be ashamed

Haaaaaaaaard
For women like me who try to have some integrity
You make it haaaaaaaaard
For girls like myself who respect themselves
And have dignity
