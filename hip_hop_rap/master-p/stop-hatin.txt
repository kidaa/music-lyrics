Chorus:
Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more
Im just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
dont wanna see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really aint hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
Im really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool dont mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors
see I dont had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards
non-packers
I'm strapped like P
or C
they ask for me 
capture me 
but im going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
yall young crazed punks are trippin 
dont hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my 
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha 
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I cant fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know yall gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why dont yall go out yall's ass up and get something 
dont worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say thats not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they wont touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just cant call it or catch
but i still got G's and Im still ballin
