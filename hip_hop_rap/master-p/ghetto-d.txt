Neighborhood dope man 
I mean real niggas 
Thata make a dolla out a fifteen cents
Ain't got a dime, but I rides and pay the rent 
Professional crackslanger I serve fiends 
I once went to jail for having rocks up in my jeans
But nowadays I be too smart for the Taz
C Murder been known to keep the rocks up in the skillet man
Waitin on a kilo they eight I'm straight you dig
What you need ten
Ain't no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You won't be getting yo money if yo shit ain't cooked long
Never cook yo dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outa town
But fuck that I'm bout to put my soldias in the game 
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine.
1. Look for the nigga wit the whitest snow
2. No buying from no nigga that you don't know
make yo way to the kitchen where the stove be
You get the baking soda I got yo D
Get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda every seven grams of coke
An shake it up until it get harder 
Then sit the tube in some ready made cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while it's still hot
And watch that shit while it can rise to the fuckin top
Now ya cocaine powda is crack.
Nigga I hopes you strapped cause you might get jacked.

Chorus

Masta P 

Nigga Nigga never let a nigga
Front you no dizos 
Start from the ground 
Work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killas on yo team
Keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools come short get rowdy
Kick down doors 
Show mutha fuckas that ya bout it bout it 
Break ki's down to oz's 
Never buy any dope 
Without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda use V-12 
Keep a stash for the tryin to take other niggas clientele
Check the man made junk for residue 
Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1. Never talk on the phone in ya house
2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house
3. Never fuck with snitches
Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4. Keep a low key
And if you movin weight 
Treat yo'self to an uzi 
The first hit for free damn
But the next time you see me 
You betta have twenty G
5. Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy 
That's the 'Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
Cause legal money last longer than drug money.

Chorus.
Fade Out.
