ugh ha, do that to one of those tenderonies
and uh, that mean you trying to do something
I'm trying to do something, ya'll hear that

chorus:
the eye contact that you and I share
make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
if I could I would
and I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be real with ya, look I'm trying to do something
the eye contact that you and I share
make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
if I could I would
and I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be blunt with ya, look I'm trying to do something

maybe it's the bud in me, or the thug in P
got these ghetto hoties wanting to put they love in me
I'm a G from the CP3 and dedicated
screaming No Limit Soldiers and these playa haters hate it
relax shorty, hit the blunt, drop the Ruger
come close to a nigga, let the P seduce ya
work it like a Solo Flex, say you wanna a ruff-neck
Cristal and strawberries, weed smoking, rough sex
I want you to open your legs as wide as you could
so I can hit from the back with this nickle plated wood
up and down like a roller coaster
from your stomach to your back
let a gangsta poke ya
I ain't trippin, never slippin cause I got straps
9 months later, we ain't bustin no caps
crispy clean, no strings attached
little bump-n-grind, miss thang are you with that

CHORUS

I heard you want a romance
wont you lay up there and give me the chance
I ain't saying romance, now what you to be enhanced
I'm matured enough, and I ain't approached you for nothing
and the reason I came up off cause you workig with something
now I done had a little herb, now I done build up the nerve
on top of that my head tight from everything the boss serve
I'm pitching, cause your curves got me wanting to slide home
and prove that I flip other things besides ounz
tel your girl you're gone, baby you gots to rome
he leaving with things, he get it on, get it on
you cold make me moan, so you up for screwing me
please use engenuity when you doing me
damn you  blues with you matching hot shoes
pretty legs but knees gone get bruised
there's no one gonna get used

straight to the point shorty
look I'm trying to do something

CHORUS

back stage at the concerts peepin
you wanted me to see you and I'm thinking about creepin
far from home, destination unknown, rock bone
hotel booked and I don't wanta be alone
maybe it's the tone got me visualizing this song
camouflauge love all night making me moan
thug passion, in the back seat ripping off your fashion
run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin
I'm here tonight and the vibe is right
red and blue lights are glowing over Brian McKnight
but tomorrow my flight, and I'll be outta your sight
take my address down so you can write
but for now lets do something
fuck the frontin and the talking
my dogs just about barkin
take your outfit off and put the soldiers shit on
and go to the war with me
pager number's on the desk
hit me when you trying to do something

CHORUS
