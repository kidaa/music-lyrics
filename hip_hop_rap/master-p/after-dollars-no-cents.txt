    Come 1 Come All, TRU niggaz ball I told ya,

Chorus:
After Dollars, No Cents.
From Shabz 2 Benz,
From Cheddar 2 Cheeze,
Tryna Pay Tha Rent.

     I'm a hustla, balla, nigga gee'z, cut keyz, gats for enemies, freeze, hund
reds of greens.  Kill, robbery soldiaz
born 2 ride, killaz born 2 die, mommaz born 2 cry.
Wild like tha lone fuck'n ranger, niggaz from tha South
keep 1 up in tha chamber.  Lord knows when ya enemy is
quick, that's why niggaz watch'n niggaz back, cuz they
gone off that pila shit.  Cane, niggaz game, heroin in
tha vain, fuck'n with there brains.  Who tha next nigga
ta get popped by a cop  Who tha next in tha hood 2
get shot  I hope it ain't me, so I'm strapped with a bulletproof.  Nigga on my
 stomach see muthafuck'n TRU.
Soldia till I die, fuck it I won't cry, look my enemy in
tha eye.  Fuuck every nigga that ain't real, cuz we bout it,
 amp; if I have to die cuz a nigga gon' shout it!  I was born
a No Limit Soldia from heart.  Cowards run they mouth, but
killaz don't talk.

Chorus x2

     You no Kris, I'm Kros, y'all ran, we walked.
No Limit niggaz got Ghetto Dope by pounds  amp; balls.
Blow'n tapes up in flames, like weed.  Got boxed
albums up like keyz from tha South 2 Overseaz.
Nigga, Independent  amp; Rowdy, niggaz check billboard,
number 1  amp; Bout It.  That's why niggaz tryna get us
on tha radio, now niggaz might see tha P on tha
video, but a niggaz still TRU 2 tha gizame.  Represent
tha hood,  amp; every fuck'n nigga that gang-bang.  These
streets iz so real, fool guard ya grill.  Smoke 1 fo'
tha homies that have made it over tha hill, cuz we...

Chorus x2

rags to riches, cuz I've always had money, plus I've always
had bitches.  Young muthafuckaz tryna get Mojo, nigga act

including weed  amp; bitchez.

 amp; guard tha dope.
