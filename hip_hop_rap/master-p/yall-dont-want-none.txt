It's on now nigga we ready it's on!

I'm on the block, and I keep my nine cocked
I got a problem - it's handled, with some automatic shots
See I'm a thug - and I love to smoke weed
And I'm a hustler - that mean I love to serve fiends
I'm from the 3rd Ward, Callio', and I'ma represent it
You don't know me  You better stay out of my business
cause I float like a butterfly and I sting like a bee
But nigga I don't box, I'm the M to the P
I crush domes - I got some niggaz that'll break bones
And if I can't catch you, then I'ma follow yo' bitch home
We got beef - then you know I can't sleep
And if it's a war - then we can take it to the streets

[Master P - repeat 4X]
It's on now nigga we ready it's on!
