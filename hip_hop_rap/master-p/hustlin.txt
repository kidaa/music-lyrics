[C-Murder]

Down South huster, slangin on dat corner stackin dividends
fuckin over fiends cause my ghat is my only friend
and won't hesitate to use my sawed off
I'll knock on ya door and shoot ya motherfuckin head off
c-murder a real fuckin natural born killah  for realah my nigga
I'm badder cause my nuts is bigger
strapped with a tec-9 a mac-10 and 2 glocks
dumpin niggas in ditches cause I'm a thug like 2Pac
I'm kickin it in Cali but I was born in dat N.O.
murder is daily everybody packin heat bro
punk bitches can't survive when ya scary
everyday young niggas  gettin shipped to the mortuary
Night time falls the motherfuckin streets ain't safe
at the fuckin club the jackers run the place
but I gotta do what I gotta do like Manson
I'm crazy for takin these penitentiary chances
cause once the money start commins it's like you just can't stop it
a nigga aint' shit without his pockets
So watch yo back when a nigga like C doin bad
I'll do a solo jack and dey a never find yo ass
Ra ta tat tat tat tat is the sound of my hollow
they find ya fuckin corpse stinkin in the ghetto tommorrow
so act like a bitch and you'll get treated like a busta
dat's how it is with dis down south hustler

[chorus]
