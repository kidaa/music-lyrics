[Master P]

The game of life did change
the old dope game is now called the rap game
in other words you can't trust nobody
money's the root of all evil
I can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare

if you want me come get me how the fuck you gone take me
I got my true niggas with me and we riders2X

Hit the road with motherfuckin casket closed
young nigga fourteen doing death row
look in the eyes of some killers drug dealers
from the projects young niggas
pulling hits in the ghetto to make change
that cop nigga blasting on other game
young villians in the ghetto starving
henicy and green with a young nigga balling
pull the plug if they shot me
just die every nigga and bitch that tried to stop me
just a young nigga tryin make skrilla
learnin double it up with the killas and the drug dealers
Ugggggggggh

if you want me come get me how the fuck you gone take me
I got my true niggas with me and we riders2X

its hard times on the blocks in the projects
call my girl up in time to flip a county check
I got cocaine weed and enphadamine
Pac said P keep your eyes on your enemies
I ain't trusting no nigga or no bitch
that's the recipe in the hood nigga to get rich
thugs keep their gats right beside them
true niggas keep their gats cuz we riders
hold the gauge motherfucker while I blow his head
hit the horn motherfucker two niggas dead
R.I.P. tatoos weed and henicy
blow dust to the motherfucking enemies

if you want me come get me how the fuck you gone take me
I got my true niggas with me and we riders2X

In school with pencils pass and books
in the ghetto with in Tex in killers and crooks
I done seen bloodshed over blood money
I done niggas kill over drug money
got the game from some OG ballin
down here 3rd world cali or new orleans
I won't change till they bury me a paid nigga
I won't change cuz P is a made nigga
I got killers and dealers on my side
I got homies and jackals ready to ride
got the game in my vein cuz I'm bout this
how many niggas out there really doubt this

if you want me come get me how the fuck you gone take me
I got my true niggas with me and we riders2X

camaflauge and all that murder murder kill kill and shit
bad nigga from the bricks blood on my kicks
seen it all in the project halls and the street corners
never choked even when those folks ran up on us
solider rag sag on my eye no lie

how many niggas follow my lead the envious swallow my feed
laying niggas down lay em down nigga like apollo creed if need
got my game from that nigga versal keep your enemies close
shoot first and show the fakers no mercy
never dance with them youngsters
in your life nigga you don't wanna live amongst us

bullet proof vest cover my chest
so you best aim for my brain if you try to put me to rest we riders

if you want me come get me how the fuck you gone take me
I got my true niggas with me and we riders2X
