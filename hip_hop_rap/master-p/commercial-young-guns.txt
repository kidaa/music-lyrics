Yo Los, take us to a commercial
While we stop to get high
y'all check out the Young Guns, ya heard me

Check this out..
If you have four ounces and you fronted your boy two
and he gave a half to his boy
and the police raided the spot then he flushed one and a half
and he ask you for one mo'
what should you do if you was in that position

[Young Guns]
Nigga fuck that!  I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that!  I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill

Tell them bitch niggaz - they can keep from around
This is family now, I give a fuck about you clowns
Young Guns holdin it down, quick to bust a few rounds
 our sound, tell my niggaz and my bitches
they'll drop in the storm, tell them boys it's on
And these niggaz gettin they ass torn, fuck bein warned
This is a street , I promise to die violent
Now I start wildin, until you bitch niggaz are silent

Nigga fuck that!  I'm bout to send these niggaz life back
They talkin shit about my fam and I don't like that
You know how I react, so why you wanna beef
It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggaz gon' get numb
Here come  down the block nigga don't try to run
I ain't lettin it slide I caught him slippin and him twice
Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

These niggaz fail the test so neverthless I split yo' chest
FUCK THE REST!
I come through to spit, to show you niggaz what I manifest
A Y.G., so I breathe toke three, 
Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggaz in our town
You get them hot thangs laid in your mouth
My niggaz seek you out no doubt
All about my salary you niggaz ain't gon' handle me
I'm tired of stressin, and all these niggaz pretend they got me vexed

[Young Guns]
Nigga fuck that!  I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that!  I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that!  I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill..
