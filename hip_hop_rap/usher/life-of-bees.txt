Always believed we could fly through this life of bees
Seems so illogical
Withered and worn you decide to burn off your wings
I've grown so uncomfortably numb
With the skin i've been living in

The wings they uncurl
Like the strangest of birds
We're all breaking down again
As I look to the sky
Through the fallout tonight
We're all breaking down again

Quietly the blind leading the blind deny all our senses
Feels quite unusual
Pretending the cruelty is kind still you defend it
And I feel so uncomfortably numb
With the pain that you're living in

The wings they uncurl
Like the strangest of birds
We're all breaking down again
As I look to the sky
Through the fallout tonight
We're all breaking down again
