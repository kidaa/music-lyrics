How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you

Had a dream I could turn back time
Had to stop to rewind my memory
Had a vision of the ruby sky we were riding high
On our own pink elephant
Another day in this fucked up life
Another struggle just to get through nine to five
Maybe it was only ego talking
But I always thought we were innocent

How are you
How are you

Had the answer on my fingertips
'Til I lost it in the wind like a friend I'll never find
Deep in the belly is a love so thick
And I thought I had it but makes me sick now
I'm imagining the fields so green
But I would settle for the the truth in anything
Where I'm floating I can't feel my skin
But I might get home
Hey, I might get back again

How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you

Had a dream I could turn back time
Had to stop to rewind my memory
Had a vision of the ruby sky we were riding high
On our own pink elephant
Another day in this fucked up life
Another struggle just to get through nine to five
Where I'm floating I can't feel my skin
But I might get home
I might get back again

How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you
How are you
