Borrowed in black you are mine
Don't make it easy don't make it hard
Don't make it so simple again
So so easy again
Bound like a child you are mine
I can't defend you
I won't complain
I won't go so so quiet again
Go so gently again

A million a million more
A million a million more
A million a million more
For you to burn

Promised your mother I'd write
I'd kill you quickly
I'd keep you calm
I'd make it all so simple again
All so quiet
Here once the morning was bright
But violence changes changes the light
And now I've grown so empty again
Grown so empty again

A million a million more
A million a million more
A million a million more
For you to burn

I can be cold dear I can be cold as you wanted
Living is hard here
When I'm just the whore that you wanted me to be

A million a million more
A million a million more
A million a million more
For you to burn
