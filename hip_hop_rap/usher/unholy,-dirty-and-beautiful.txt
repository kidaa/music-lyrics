Bound by the time on the clock
Bittersweet wondering the quiet transfusion
Hold tight nothing is complicated
Hold tight everything's fine
Confidence fell through the hole in your pocket
The simple's illogical so it be logic
I'm caught in the diaries with all your complaining
The curious scribblings of one who has everything

Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful

Cherish the lies that you bought
Charming delusions gone crack in the fire
I know we might be mediocre
I know nothing's on fire
Confidence fell through the hole in your pocket
The simple's illogical so it be logic
I'm caught in the diaries with all your complaining
The curious scribblings of one who has everything

Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful me
Unholy and dirty and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Unholy and dirty

You can give a try
Average to sustain
You can give a see
You can give a stay
Everything's to the feel
As the years go by
Listen to the tide
You can make a stride
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again

Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful me
Unholy and dirty and beautiful

Never come again
Never come again
Never come again
Never come again...
