Umm Why, Umm Why

Living on the edge out of control
And the world just wont let me slow down
But in my biggest picture was a photo of you and
me
Girl you know I tired "I WORK HARD TO" provide
all the material things I thought that would make
you happy
I'm confuse can you make me understand
Cause I tired to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool maybe I was "BLIND"
But never took time to see!

Can u help me
Tell me what you want from me

Baby help me
Without you my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy! Lifes a prison when your in
love alone

Oh girl I need you come back home you know I need you
I don't want to be alone

Girl I put your love up on the shelf
And I guess I didn't have to go that
AND NOW WERE NOT TOGETHER, cause I hurt you many
times
And now your not around
I wish for every moment in time
That I wasted we used it to make sweet love.

Want you to know that I got you.
If you need it. I don't want to be on the outside
looking in

prison when your in love alone

Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging pleading
