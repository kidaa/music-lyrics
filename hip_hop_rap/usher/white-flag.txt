Took the acid in the afternoon
Just to be part of the scenery with all the lonely People there we are
Took a trip out to the galaxy
I'm not looking for salvation just a taste of liberation
I said my friends
Like to sit all day and watch the stars bend

I can see your white flag flying in the distance
I know that it's lonely there where you are
If everything is perfect tell me why you're hurting
It won't be long

Took a trip out to the girly show
It was there i talked to jesus he said christ Don't you believe it
Another drink and we talked all night
I asked does it hurt to be you he said boy it hurts like hell
He said my friends
Like to sit all day and watch the stars bend

I can see your white flag flying in the distance
I know that you're lonely there where you are
If everything's so perfect tell me why you're hurting
It won't be long

Three am and the light's so strange
Little rosa's started dancing now with all the lonely people there we are
Leans to me asks for a cigarette
I asked does it hurt to be you
She said boy it hurts like hell
She said my friends like to sit all day and watch the stars bend
