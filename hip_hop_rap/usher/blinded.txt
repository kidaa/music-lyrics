Turn me out then turn me on
Pretty flower can you tell me what's become of who we are
Only asking what you'd like tonight
Well take America
Just shake my tits and ass yeah we'll go far

And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can't try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded

Sell a little bit to you
A circus sideshow but the makeup's shining through it's not so bad
Is there anyone to know
Forget my politics just sex me 'til I'm done it's not so hard

And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded

And all the stars are out for you
And everybody's hiding here
And all the stars have come unglued
But everybody everybody's changing
We're changing
We're changing

And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can't try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded
Always blinded

And all the stars are out for you
And everybody's hiding here
And all the stars have come unglued
But everybody everybody's changing
We're changing
We're changing
We're changing

Thank you
