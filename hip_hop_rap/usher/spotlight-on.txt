Caught on the train
amuse myself and eavesdrop on those japanese girls Party-planning
Chic and lovely broken english
She smiles at me and mouths that we're all fools

That's new york style
Endless nights keep rushing by
We wander out onto the sidewalk
Cigarettes are piling high
Hustlers and the queens are singing

Still we are
Invincible
We thought we'd be forever young
Standing here beneath the sign
With spotlight on

Missed the rain
Coming home it's early morning

Desperate in our invitation
Asking all those lovers just to stay
Drift away
Through the buildings dawn is breaking
All the people line for coffee
Read about the day's disasters
Hustlers and the queens are singing

Still we are
Invincible
We thought we'd be forever young
Standing here beneath the sign
With spotlight on
