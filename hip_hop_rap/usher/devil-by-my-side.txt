Believe in hope, 
Believe in faith, 
Believe in things I can't fight, 
Believe in truth, 
Believe in slavery, 
But it's only the television kind, 
Believe that light will find a way, 
Believe in jets as they blow into the sky 
Believe in you, believe in me, 
And all of these things, 

Devil by my side, 
And the freaks are out we're in force tonight, 
And you opened me wide, 
'Cause it's cold in there and it's warm outside 

Believe that hate will never die, 
Believe in sex and love in a dangerous time, 
Believe in grace and your intelligence, 
Believe in exploring the corners of the mind, 
Believe your truth is not my truth, 
That God can exist with many faces at one time, 
Believe that we will find a way through all of these things, 

Devil by my side, 
And the freaks are out we're in force tonight, 
And you opened me wide, 
'Cause it's cold in there and it's warm outside, 
Hard when you realize that you'll never have what you're trying to find.
