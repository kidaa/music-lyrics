You came apart on me last Sunday morning
Chocked and indicted by the truth
And it's always tough when there's never enough
Of the good things coming
And there was never enough for you
There was never enough for you

Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't see you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore

Got excited when I thought that we would last
Twisted inside out 'til we were drowning
From the first attack we could never go back so we just keep on coming
But I was never enough for you
Was there ever enough for you

Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore

And if you think you're dying
Baby well you know I felt the same
'Cause we were only hoping
Why's it always feel like, feel like
It feels like rain

Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't see you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore
