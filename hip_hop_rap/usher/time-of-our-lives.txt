I once saw a man on fire
Staring at his window
Watching as the flames grew higher and higher
I thought that i saw him cry
Or was he only laughing
As his life went rushing on..

And maybe we're just like him.. 
Maybe we're all waiting
For our moment to begin

Who of us are open
Who of us have freedom really
Who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
All of us are hurting
All of us are crazy now
All of us are watching the world as it spins

I once had bird like u
A bird of prey
Still your tearing at my insides
And yesterday when you flew so far away
If you find the morning save a piece for me

Who of us are open
Who of us have freedom really
Who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
All of us are hurting
All of us are crazy now
We're crazy now..

I'll smoked a cigerette
I'll eat the flesh instead
Another whiskey more or less
Or more or less, yea
I like the drugs that sail
I love u when we fail
When we fail

I once saw a man on fire
Staring at his window
Watching as the flames grew higher and higher
I thought that i saw him cry
Or was he only laughing
Laughing..

Who of us are open
Who of us have freedom really
Who of us can tell what these dark days will bring
All of us are hurting
All of us are crazy now
We're crazy now..

All of us are hating
All of us are dreaming
All of us are watching these times of our lives
We want it all
We want for nothing
For nothing now
