Did you feel small today when everyone had gone
'Cause I was beaten up and jaded by the news
And underneath the skin the truth is breaking through
So they just sewed me up and spit me out
And I can't change it
I can't change this

You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try

My thoughts are floating as reality explodes
I'm whispering to each of you my friends
And every moment seems to freeze frame through the room
All the colors are electrified
But I can't see now
I can't see now

You you take away the world 
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try

And I'm drifting through myself again
Tell me how I got so high
Where the conscience bends the air is thin
And I can't change it
I can't change this

You you take away the world 
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try

One more try, yeah
Just give me one more try
One more try, yeah
Just give me one more try
