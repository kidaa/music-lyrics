Day by day we fall apart
Disintegrate the lightning rains across the sky But comes too late
To change the mood and save us now
It's criminal the way we love
The way we hate it's almost human
Eyes are opened wide

Stood on the rooftop scream at the sky again
Dance to the radio end of the world we know
Ugly is beautiful beauty in stereo
Thinking of you
Just like the earth spins high as a kite again
There with the river flow end of the life i've known
Ugly is beautiful beauty so terrible
Thinking of you

All the words we throw away
Like paper cuts they just keep piling
Higher and higher throughout the day
Illogical the script we're writing
It's chemical the way we love
The way we hate it's quite inhuman
Eyes are opened wide

Stood on the rooftop scream at the sky again
Dance to the radio end of the world we know
Ugly is beautiful beauty in stereo
Thinking of you
Just like the earth spins high as a kite again
There with the river flow end of the world we've known
Ugly is beautiful beauty so terrible
Thinking of you
