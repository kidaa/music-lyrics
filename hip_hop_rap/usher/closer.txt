You had to lose
A funny thing the part we can't play
I'd love to offer you with all the blame
But now we have to choose
Another round for all my friends and me
Another poke at sensibility
We've found out

Why are we floundering
I'm drowning in the reveler's sin
I've taken you up on your offerings
I don't even know it's good bye

You had to lose
Always knew that we weren't quite the same
I blew it up with everyone who ever knew me
Had to change
A revidescent light to shine the way
And we're not always following the same way out now

Why are we floundering
I'm drowning in the reveler's sin
I've taken you up on your offerings
I don't even know it's good bye
Goodbye
