Turn the lights out, 
The party is over and the wines all gone, 
Your good friends are headed home, 
Wish I could be there, 
I'm floating, 
Was happy to hear you turned thirty-three, 
You look good, you're so carefree, 
Wish I could be there 

But I thought you should know, 
That inside I've grown cold, 
And I fight every day to lose control, 
It's a Saturday, 
I'm coming down 

Frustrated, 
Got caught in the rain going to work today, 
Soaked through for the job I hate, 
I wish you could be here, 
I'm choking, 
Swallowed to much of my pride today, 
The words that I just won't say, 
I wish you could be here 

But I thought you should know, 
That inside I've grown cold, 
And I fight every day to lose control, 
It's a Saturday, 
I'm coming down 

For the first time, I've seen stars at night, 
For the first time, I'm on fire 

But I thought you should know, 
That inside I've grown cold, 
And I fight every day to lose control, 
It's a Saturday, 
I am coming down, 
It's a Saturday, 
I'm coming down.
