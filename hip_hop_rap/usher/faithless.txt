Lord oh lord
cant you hear me calling
lord of lord
hope it wont take long
im feeling quite good
from the asthma pills and alcohol
in the blink of an eye
itll all be gone
so i get high high higher
cant fake a life so beautiful
cant escape this world so faithless
its dragging me down
lord oh lord
wont you give me a reason
the simplest word
just to help us survive
im caught here again
between the laundry and my little one
another atheists love
is passing you by
so i get high high higher
cant fake a life so beautiful
cant escape theis world so faithless
its dragging me down
dont know why we live in fear not harmony
cant stop time were always moving on
dont know why were always running away
