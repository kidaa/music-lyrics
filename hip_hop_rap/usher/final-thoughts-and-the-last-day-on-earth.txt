Heaven haunts me kill for a cigarette
Heaven is all that I got

My god left me without one word of warning
My god left me waiting is all that I got

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger crashing down
All my life I've seen your babies
Crashing to the ground

Needle brought me comfort to keep me stable
Comfort, paid for
Comfort is all that I got

My god left me without one word of warning
My god left me
My god is all that I got

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger crashing down
All my life I've seen your anger
Crashing to the ground

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger crashing down
All my life I've seen your babies
Crashing to the ground

Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
Don't be afraid
We're all afraid
