Here it comes again at 3 am
that empty space it just takes my breath away
walk outside its the strangest thing
snow has fallen radiates
i dont know but ive been told
all i know is what i see had such a sweet dream
it end in disaster
and somehow you could not find your way back through the door
im seeing the car crash
the end of the love song and eve now i cant make it back
wehre you are
im going home new york citys become a friend to me
and every street helps to wash out clean my memory
all of the faces they hide the light
i feel that change but the change passes me by
i dont know but ive been told
all i know is waht i see had such a sweet dream
it end in disaster and somehow i could not find my way back through the door
i follow the side walks and all of you footprints
but somehow i could not make it back to wehre you are
im going home
