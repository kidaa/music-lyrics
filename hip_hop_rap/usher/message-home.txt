If I fell in love, 
Would you sort me out, 
Would you take me deep, 
Would you go without? 
If I never leave, 
Took the pills again, 
Would you love me more? 

If I buried you, 
Would you bury me? 
If I broke in two, 
Would that set me free? 
If I never need, 
Took the life again, 
Would you love me more? 

And what did you think we would find? 
Traveled a million miles but still no sign, 
And what did they think we would find? 
Pilot to anyone, we've all gone blind

If I'll only need you, 
We'll keep it complicated, 
If you never find out, 
Will we still be waiting, 
If I'm too strung out, 
And I follow you, 
Would you need me more? 

If I never try, 
And we never take, 
If we never bend, 
Then we'll never break, 
If we stimulate, 
And we sexualize, 
Will you need it more? 

And what did you think we would find? 
Traveled a million miles but still no sign, 
And what did they think we would find? 
Pilot to anyone we've all gone 

So I'm not in love, 
I can sort it out, 
You can't take me any deeper,
Or I will go without, 
If we never need, 
All the pills again, 
Would you love me more? 

If I war on you, 
Will you war on me? 
If I break you down, 
Will that set you free? 
If we never need, 
The life again, 
Would you love me more, 
And more? 

And what did you think we would find? 
Traveled a million miles but still no sign, 
And what did they think we would find? 
Pilot to anyone we've all gone blind
