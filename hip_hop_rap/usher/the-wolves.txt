Walk dont run or these wolves will chase you down keep your heart well buried underground and we are
vicious enough without love were ugly enough without love sleep doing sleep im coming after you the
leaves are in the fall of full release you know theyll rip you throuh and we are guilty enough wihtout
hate were ugly enough without love we may find a better day
