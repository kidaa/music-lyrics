Every time I look at u
There's so many thing that I want to do
I promise u when I'm ready
I'm gonna spend my whole life with u

What is love is it steady
Cause I don't know what to do
Tell me girl if you're ready
To do what we came to do

One day we could be together
Cause u know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now we can all forget it
U know I gots to get around

I don't have much money, I can't buy a diamond ring
I'm not tryin' to be funny, but it's only a sexual thing

Can u get wit it
It's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can u get wit it
It's like that
You're gonna love the joy I bring

Please forgive me cause I don't ever want rush u
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do

U know that time is really precious
And u wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have 2 keep on movin'
If you can't make up your mind

One day we could be together
Cause u know that I wanna be down
But right now we can all forget it
Cause u know I gots to get around
