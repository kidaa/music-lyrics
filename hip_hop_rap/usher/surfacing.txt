Car crash East side of town, 
The waters deep here you can feel your own Strength fading, 
You're beginning to let go, 
The bubbles rise as we go down, 
Underwater, overwhelmed, 
Can't fight the current here It's starting to take hold 

But high above me I can see the surface now, 
The picture perfect life is fading out of view, 
And high above me I can feel the world, 
But I don't need it [x3], 
I just need you, 
I just need you 

Then you grow colder like a dream, 
I can't believe the practical things, 
They're always out of reach, 
And I know you're not really here, 
These visions fly so quickly on the edge, 
They're starting to take hold 

But high above me I can see the surface now, 
The picture perfect life is fading out of view, 
And high above me I can feel the world, 
But I don't need it [x3]

Won't you help me with this loneliness? 
'Cause I don't know what's wrong or right, 
Underneath the truth, 
Won't you help me with this bitterness, 
'Cause I can't seem to walk outside
