Just another afternoon and im choking down tea for two
when youve flown so far away
and you know im waiting
then the consequence of rage comes crashing through the living room floor
when i thought id found a life seems ive been mistaken
so i take the paid holiday
but i just cant set foot on the plane
well your voice gets in the way
guess ill drive cross sountry
i see you fall well my suits been pressed and cleaned
and ive never seen these people before
so we wander through the town
and we sing our sad songs
as i lower you into the ground
and youve never seen these people before with the bullets falling all around
and they sing their sad songs
i see you fall
