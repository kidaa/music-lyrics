Conscience has come its incest as always
made us believers 
i am not the one
wanting fought off desire 
everything is alright by me now
nervous and numb
flew over the top of it
outstretched each arm with a reason for being
fought off denils
everything is arlight by me now
i can feel it
life is changing just around the bend
its waiting i can feel it
life is changing just around the bend
its waiting
smile at the world
an unconscious ending take one last look
mine is not the one wanting
undress desire
everything is alright by ne now
i can feel it
life is changing just around the bend
its waiting
i can feel it
life is changing just around the bend
its waiting
