Breathe
Hallicinations start to fade
All the colours are back to grey 
I never understood these things I hated,
But now, as we all disappear
The world becomes quiet clearly 
Something I can live in 
If I could just get through tonight

The poison's in my head
And I can't feel my legs
I'm not feeling anything

I'm standing at the top looking down
Thought I'd be so free
Float in outerspace, take a breath 
Don't you breathe too deep
I'm standing at the top looking down, 
Thought it'd be so damn easy
I thought it would be easier

Wait, hallucinations back in place 
I said I'd call if I can't face 
Another day of normal 
That's what they gave me 
But now the telephone's on fire
And I can't seem to dial
Even though I know 
You're there to save my soul tonight

The poison's in my head 
And I can't feel my legs
I'm not feeling anything
I can't feel anything

I'm standing at the top looking down
Thought I'd be so free
Float in outerspace, take a breath 
Don't you breathe too deep
Stepping off the top, feel the wind 
Underneath my feet

Standing at the top looking down
Float in outerspace; there's no sound

The poison's in my head 
And I can't feel my legs
I'm not feeling anything

I'm standing at the top looking down
Thought I'd be so free
Float in outerspace, take a breath
Don't you breathe too deep
Stepping off the top, feel the wind 
Underneath my feet

Standing at the top looking down
Float in outerspace; there's no sound

I feel alive
I feel alive
I feel alive...
