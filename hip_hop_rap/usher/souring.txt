Daylight mornings creeping in had the blackest bream
are you souring
and i dreamt that i wiped all the blood from your eyes
woke up thinking i love you
but i cant say why
so please leave your fucking money at the door
condede you know youll be coming back for more
were all looking for gold here midnight and you inch along
devils in the backyard now where it all went wrong
and i drinik myself sick so i wont see you crawl
guess i drained all your beauty to watch you dissolve
so drink myself sick so i wont see you crawl
guess i dreained all youre beauty to watch you dissolve
so please leave you fucking money at the door
concede you know youll be coming back for more
were all looking for gold here and i hate that i need you
and i dont know why
and i hate that i need 
and i dont know why
so please
leave your fucking money at the door
concede you know youll be coming back for more
were all looking for gold here
