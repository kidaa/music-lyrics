What if I were you and you were me
Still can't see the forest fire beyond the trees
Now I'm standing in a field of green
The colours burning far as I can see
What do you see

On my tongue the galaxies so small
Here I'll drink it down and watch the world dissolve
Now I'm pouring through the universe and slipping 
through the endless stream of time
What would you find

And I'm flying floating on the wind again
Hoping it will drag me in
Can't you see i'm laughing
Laughing at the consequence
Laughing at this circumstance
Don't you know by now

Wave at all the faces they go by
Faster that we live the more we die
Now I'm crashing through the open door and smiling in a most peculiar way
What would you say

And I'm falling faster than the waterfall
Opened up and after all
Can't you see I'm drowning
Right here in the open air
Wishing I could still go clear
Don't you know by now
Don't you know by now
This is what we are
This is what we are
Don't you know by now
Don't you know by now
This is what we are
This is what we are

Flying floating on the wind again
I'm wishing that you'd drag me in
Can't you see I'm hoping Wishing I could see myself
Wishing I was someone else
But don't you know by now
Don't you know by now
This is what we are
This is what we are
Don't you know by now
Don't you know by now
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are
This is what we are...
