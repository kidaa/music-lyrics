Breathe blood is in the water
Hold on tight i'm coming
I'll be there soon
Keep your eyes high on the horizon
All the clouds are falling
Between me and you

And you've grown so cold
Too numb to notice
That the sky has turned so blue

Fight even underwater
Struggle makes it harder
There's nothing left to do
Don't close your eyes even for a moment
Even for one second
I'll be there soon

And we close our eyes
Too numb to notice
That the sky has turned so blue
