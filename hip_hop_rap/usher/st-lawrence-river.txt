Smells on the air
See there it's crushing the final impression
The stains on the paper
Where words fell like water
Unearth all the changes that never did matter
I think it's beginning to freeze here

Caught in the rage and the fire of things
All the brightness that burns me
I'm fumbling through like a child in the dark
When the nakedness comes
I am shocked by the colour the glorious weight of your skin
Comes alive
And I never thought we'd make it back so soon
Might be nice
But I knew you'd be your own destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you

Here please forgive me
Could we escape all the bitterness piled upon bitterness
Held in the face of the things that I don't understand
Intellectualize over and over
This helplessness suits us
Funny how quiet has slipped to our corners
Worn all our edges away
You are watching breathing and baiting
Wanting and warming and cautiously waiting
For some simple signal to creep cross your conscience
Uncover redemption and oh did I mention
I carried you down to the St. Lawrence River
The banks running dirty the water's beginning to freeze here
Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morning

Comes a lie
And I never thought you'd get me back so soon
Might be nice
But it's only if my own destroyer
Comes alive
And I always knew I'd make it up to you

I saw on your face such a curious grin
As I let go your hand
I was desperate to hold you again
But you're sinking so deep in the water
Outsmarted myself and so easily gave up what I wanted
Solid by morning
What I wanted
Winter by morning

Comes alive
And I never thought you'd make it up so soon
Night be nice
But I always knew you're my destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you

Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morning
