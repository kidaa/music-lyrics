Still the snow keeps falling
Till we can't keep out the cold
But they don't know
That my back was broken there
I'm so numb i can hardly move
You don't know

And so you give love too easily some people say

And i dreamt i was flying
And i left you so far below
Where i can't see
When the world is crumbling
It's so hard just to watch you bleed
But you can't see

And so we give love too easily some people say

And my back was broken
I'm so cold I can hardly breathe
You can't see

Don't give up
