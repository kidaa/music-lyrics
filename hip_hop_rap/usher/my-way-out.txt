Standing at the edge
The edge of it all
Spitting off the top
Watch the day unfurl
Cannot see the view from this place
Clouds are on the rise world is out of faith
Took another pill to find my way
Hope that you'll be there

'Cause this is my way out of it tonight
And this is my last chance to ease the fire
And this is my way out of it tonight
How about you
How about you

Borrowed from a dream
That I use to know
All my friends were there
We watched the world explode
Took another drink to find my way
Just hope that you'll be there

'Cause this is my way out of it tonight
And this is my last chance to ease the fire
This is my way out of it tonight
I might find one way to get through
How about you
How about you
How about you

And if I could remember
If I could find a place a time the space to see another way home
And if I could forget you
Maybe there's no other way out
No other way out

Standing at the edge how about you
The edge of it all how about you

How about you
How about you

Standing at the edge how about you
The edge of it all how about you

How about you
How about you

'Cause this is my way out of it tonight
And this is my last chance to ease the fire
And this is my way out of it tonight
I think there's one way to get through
How about you

'Cause this is my way out of it tonight
And this is my last chance to ease the fire
And this is my way out of it tonight
I might find one way to get through
How about you
'Cause this is my way out of it tonight
And this is my last chance to ease the fire
And this is my way out of it tonight
I might find one way to get through
How about you
How about you
How about you
