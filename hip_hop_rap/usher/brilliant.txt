So far so good
Stumble through life so complicated it's nearly Impossible
And i lost my way like i knew i would and keep it Together somehow anyway
And i remember you and me
Climbing over backyard fences diving naked in the Swimming pool
All those faces friends those memories fade so fast
Like every love song on the radio

Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are low
Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are

Through a million days through a million hazy nights
We sit amusing in our politics
Through wine and talk through sex and art we fill our time
And numb ourselves with what's to come
But i'm older now got a little girl of my own
And her fears are my fears now
I know that it's the end of days for moderates
But thinking people are thinking still

Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are low
Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are

So far so good
Stumble through life so complicated it's nearly Impossible
And we lost our way like i knew we would
And keep it together somehow anyway
Woke up from an impossible dream
And we talked and we spoke and we drank and we sang
And we danced and we live and we love and we give
Without question or faith then we fight till we hate
And we hope and we pray that this violence will fade
It's always the same it's the same life
