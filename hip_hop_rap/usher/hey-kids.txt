Speak speaking for myself
pretned im someone else
i never felt the same
well this time
breath im breathing up the air
its burning up my lungs
its burning through my hari
and i never felt
hey kids what are you rocking for
stick a finger though the sky
imi blowing up the sun
the earth is going to die
i might die too
and all the things i love
and all the things i need
i never wuite received
and its still
hey kids what are you rocking for
i am staning in the rain
im laughing at myself today
and im breaking from the strain
im laughing at myself today
an di never neede more
than all of your bidies
dont you know i never deeded more than all of your love
its only been a game
palpiatation of the heart
i never watned more
so maybe we could play
its only been a game
the bleeding of the hear
you let your missiles fire
and we all start to run
