I'm the trickster burn so brightly
 I still hate you motherfuckers everyone
Wrapped in glory bound so tightly
I still crave you even when I'm overcome

Saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
To be saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright

I'm the trickster burned so badly
I still hate you motherfuckers everyone
Wore my sickness so politely
I can't be your everything to everyone
Void of meaning swelled just slightly
I still need you I still need you
Gone forever so concisely
I still need you I still need you

Saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
To be saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright

And if you hate the world
Let's say I've been there
And if you hate yourself
Well don't go changing
All the times I used your body
Done my way can't say I'm sorry
Ripped the gloss off all your memories
Consequences so demanding
Bruised and beaten
Conscience bleeding
Sexually, sexually, sexually

Saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
To be saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
And I'm saved by the light
Let me go on let me go bright
Let me go bright
