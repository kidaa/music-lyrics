Scars are piling high
Like fashion magazines
Read between the lines
So desperate for release
Get your new tattoo
So we'll all look the same
Take the chemicals
That help you through the day
Step outside your door
Do we all look the same?
No one says a word

We all get by
Above the lights
And it seems so far down and it's so far
This city tonight
We are on fire
And it seems so far down and it's so far

Sell yourself so cheap
I'll buy another round
I swear we're getting out
Still we choke it down
Coming up for air
Been weakened at the knees
No one says a word

We all get by
Above the lights
And it seems so far down and it's so far
This city tonight
We are on fire
And it seems so far down and it's so far
