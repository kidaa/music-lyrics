We are all just aching, we're waiting, 
For heartbreak in this world of light and darkness, 
I lost it, the ability, to see myself more 
Clearly I lost it, 
The ability to see 

Have you found what you've been looking for? 
Now you've killed all your enemies, 
But you still want more, 
When your hate finds the love, that it can't destroy, 
And when the cancers all gone, 
We're still growing old, old, older 

I know that your fearless, I bought it, 
What brought you to your knees? 
Your rage is visible so nearly, 
Intelligence sets you free, 
My mind is clearly undoing, 
The ability, to see 

Have you found what you've been looking for? 
Now you've killed all your enemies, 
But you still want more, 
When your hate finds the love, that it can't destroy, 
And when the cancers all gone, 
You're still growing old, old, older 

To see, have you found what you've been looking for? 
Now you've killed all your enemies, 
But you still want more, 
When your hate finds the love, that it can't destroy, 
And when the guilt is all gone, 
We're still growing old.
