I am just the grey one I'm the darker side of you
And there's a place you left inside me
I hope it will amuse
And see this sign carved in my arm
Just means I'll hate you all forever
It's my babyskin tattoo
It's all the brand name that you've left

It's not so far
From me to you it's not so far
From me to you it's not so far
From me to you it's not so far

Circumcised myself because I knew you'd be too busy
And I saw the knife was dull
Just why the fuck do you think I'm crying
Styes caught in my eye
And it swells me 'til I'm numbing
But I'll leave it here to punish you
For leaving me so hard

It's not so far
From me to you it's not so far
From me to you it's not so far
From me to you it's not so far

I deliver I will receive
All the blessings from these things given
Tested longer held back only here

I am just the grey one I'm the darker side of you
And there's a space you left inside me
I hope it will amuse
And see this sign carved in my arm
Just means I'll hate you all forever
It's my babyskin tattoo
It's all the brand name that you've left me

And I beg borrow prostrate here
Under cover of everthing made dear
Fearing only, fearing only you
