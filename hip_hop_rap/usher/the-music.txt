Baby, baby, don't be late
The world is ending I can't change
The way I feel about you now
New York is cold as ever
But still I go out every night
And hide myself among the lights
Bathe in all the pretty things the city brings
The bodies glisten and they shine
Like the stars we're born to die
And like these roses we all will fade

I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
Lost in the music all the foolishness of our lives
Speeding out of control
Lost in the music in the music

Baby, baby, please don't cry
Wipe the guilt out from your eyes
And leave your conscience on the bed
There's no one innocent here
In the mirror you'll find faith
Plastic flowers never fade but we all turn to grey

I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
Lost in the music all the foolishness of our lives
Speeding out of control
Lost in the music in the music
