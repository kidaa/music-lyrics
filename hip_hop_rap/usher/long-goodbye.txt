Just a reminal case like the fish on a hook im baited
youre welcome inside my armies are marching i cat save you who could save you
i can see that from your wounds your open wide
its coming clear now that youre leaving you forgot the eople that you've left behind
this is the long goodbye try to keep smiling as these tears break from my eyes
this is the way i used to feel guess ill be trading down from something much more  real
caught in a terrible wind with a kick in your teeth you blew me in anime eyes youve never been wuite
sure what your losing but you know youre losing so ill burn these bridges from the other side
and in the end its all inllusion you forgot the people youve left behind
this is the long long goodbye try to keep smiling as these tears break from my eyes
this is the way i use to feel guess ill be trading down for something much more real
never been quite sure what your losing but you know your losing
i can see that from your wounds youre open wide
its coming clear now that im leaving
i forgot the love that i left behind
