Well I woke up last night in a technology haze
My eyes were all sparked
From this common malaise
So I found me a doctor who said he'd even me out
Take my highs and my lows
'Cause the colours were just to loud
And as the day becomes night
And we only want greys
And the innocence runs out
Well this is the price to pay

Mr. Jangle what you gonna do when the sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time
Mr. Jangle what you gonna do when the sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time
This time, what you gonna do this time
What you gonna do, gonna do

You got caught on my teeth so I spit out my tongue
And I cut off these hands just to see if the feeling would come
And we drank 'til we drowned 'til we chocked on the world
And we bathed in the beauty of all of you

Mr. Jangle what you gonna do when the sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time
Mr. Jangle what you gonna do when the sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time
This time, what you gonna do this time
What you gonna do, gonna do
Can't can't can't wait 'til tomorrow comes

hold on

Well I woke up last night just outside of myself
Skin hair bone broke down cell by single cell
And I could not believe I had died in my sleep
Just drowned in the beauty of all of you

Mr. Jangle what you gonna do when the sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time
Mr. Jangle what you gonna do when the sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time
This time, what you gonna do this time
What you gonna do, gonna do
Can't can't can't wait 'til tomorrow comes

Because there's joy in small places
Can't wait 'til tomorrow comes
Can't wait 'til tomorrow comes
It comes in small places...
