I can see miles above the clouds, 
And what was it like on the day you fell to Earth, 
Knocked you out cold it's just as well, 
Cause people are cruelest when they don't know 

Hello, hello, 
The ships are leaving late this evening, 
Hello, hello, 
You can't deny that you don't need it now 

Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
When all the stars are dying in the sky? 
Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
Only the satellites are circling tonight, 
Tonight 

I can see blood behind your eyes, 
And what was it like, on the day you knew you died? 
Knocked up on things I don't know why, 
Cause people are cruelest when they won't mind, 

Hello, hello, 
The ships are leaving late this evening, 
Hello, hello, 
You can't pretend that you don't need it now 

Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
When all the stars are dying in the sky? 
Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
Only the satellites are circling tonight, 
Tonight 

Hello, hello, 
The ships are leaving late this evening, 
Hello, hello, 
You can't deny that you don't need it now 

Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
When all the stars are dying in the sky? 
Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
Only the satellites are circling 

Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
When all the stars are dying in the sky? 
Where will we be when tomorrow comes? 
Only the satellites are circling tonight, 
Satellites are circling, tonight 

What was it like just to have it all, 
Then it slipped right through your hands, 
How did it feel at that moment, 
When the Earth stopped turning?
