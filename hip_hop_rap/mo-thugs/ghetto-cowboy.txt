[Krayzie Bone]
The name is Krazie, big bad ass bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
That that there's kidnapped, now she was with her 
so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heep of trouble
Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't 
been held up yet
Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure thats enough time for me to get the whole 
run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin dark so now now I'm watchin for them 
damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin, tootin damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the 
bushes
Stop my horse ";wwhhooaa nellie";
Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let 
my shotgun song sing out
[Thug Queen]
Who is this? Hope this ain't the law
Jumped out the bushes with my sawed off shotgun
[Krazie Bone]
Come on out right now I'm gettin angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
[Thug Queen]
Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse 
stealer
[Krazie Bone]
Then why the hell is you hidin them bushes
[Thug Queen]
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my 
head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them 
bushes
[Krazie Bone]
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of Bob
But I could use her for the job so I told her to 
ride c'mon
[Thug Queen]
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
[Krayzie Bone]
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty 
penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you wit it
[Thug Queen]

Gotta stallion for ya parter to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride, lets ride
[Krayzie Bone]

And meet my boy in the morning for details and 
hookups

[Layzie Bone]
I'm peepin Krazyie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room I see this youngster gettin 
ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie 
just might take his life
So I approach him at a pause
Look man I really don't wanna brawl, why don't you 
chill
Before the them laws come messing up this master 
plan
Since y'all 'ready rowdy I just ask ya man, hey
You want some work, well partna put in ya bid

Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever
[Layzie Bone]
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzies in 
town
[Krayzie Bone]
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
