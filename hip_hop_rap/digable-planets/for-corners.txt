Notte D'Amore Con Te

Long is the night moonlight is fading
I feel the rhythm inside
Holding you tight dream of your body
The touch of your skin next to mine

I feel the heat temperature's rising
I'm loosing control don't keep me waiting
Baby you know we are gonna dance
Till the moon and the stars meet the sun

Sing with me
Let's come together
Dance with me
Always forever
Just be free
It's now or never
Notte d'amore con te

Balla se vuoi senti la musica
Vivrare solo per noi
Canta se puoi magiche note
Mi bruciano dentro lo sai

I feel the heat temperature's rising
I'm loosing control don't keep me waiting
Baby you know we are gonna dance
Till the moon and the stars meet the sun

I'm gonna take you high
Don't let it go till your mine
Let me be by your side
Till the end of time...
