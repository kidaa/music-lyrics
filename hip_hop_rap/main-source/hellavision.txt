* features Mikey D as the rapper instead of the Large Professor

Verse 1:
Now I'm a flip the track and bring you back to reality
I'm like Wesley Snipes, I act without a salary
Cause I don't need nobody sayin "Lights, Camera, Action!"
I act on reaction
Fuck what you see on television
Cause nowadays all of us live in the hellavision
On every single channel it's the same old sane
Brothers' poppin their brain
Or gettin wrecked at a soccer game
Six brothers fallin victim to the street
After mad ? tribe vibes rollin in the black jeep
Every other channel spent its money on the talk shows
From Oprah to Horazo, everybody in New York knows
But when a brother gets real
They make the story opposite
And try to offer niggas raw deals

Chorus:
Television tells lies to the vision
The world's a prison
We're livin in hellavision

Verse 2:
Every day your lie to me is drama
But not the type of drama that my T.V. shows
Because it makes the drama calmer
When a lady's caught cheatin
She sets with the next man
And doesn't even catch a ass-beatin
Reality check - that's what the T.V. said
Cause in real life it's two to the fuckin head
Samedy Sam fillin bugs with slugs
Wild ? is cookin up these deadly drugs
Bart Simpson is cursin up for storm
And children love this shit man, come on
I see kids that say bringin guns to school
Ten year old crack heads and that ain't cool
My four year old daughter curses worse than Bart
Straight from my heart, it's tearin me apart
Chorus

Verse 3:
And now, hip hop is labelled as a violencer
Like everyone who rhymes packs a gat with the silencer
Every other ? hip hopper goes to prison
Over some dumb shit or for the real life livin
But who's to know what we've been goin through
When all you see is one side of us
The side the T.V. be showing you
You never hear about the stress or the work
Or the hard times we had or hip hop was getting jerked
You only see us in the limelight
But when the night comes, we're always linked to crime, right?
Man - what I've been through is strife
Yo - they could make fifty movies of my motherfuckin life
And there's a million like me
The people you don't see
When you watch your everyday T.V.

Chorus
