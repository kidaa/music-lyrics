Now this is not your average everyday rap song
We won't be rocking bells that go a ding and a dong
The bass drummer hipper won't be lingering on
Check out the way, we kick it on the microphone
The funky beat is playing and we're swinging along
The Underground is rocking with the Hip-Hop song
The drums is ringing with the serious tone
I clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Now MCs, you like the way we swing? Yeah!

[Shock G, Money B & Tupac]
Well, listen close to make sure you don't miss a thing
Don't you know that we're the musical magicians
Pleasing, teasing all your deepest interwishing
Concepts, entertainment for the masses
Sometimes we rock it fast or kick it slow as molasses 
Depending on the style that we choose to flex
We're like the network, you'll never know what's next
We rock for freaks, not benefits for students in classes
On MTV clowning with the Humpty Nose in glasses
The funky beat is playing and we're swinging along
The Underground is rocking with the Hip-Hop song
The funky drums is ringing with the serious tone
I clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Now MCs, you like the way we swing? Yeah!
Cause America, likes the way we swing We love you too!

[Shock G, Money B & Tupac]
MCs, you like the way we swing?
I hope you do, cause if you don't it don't mean a thing
See we don't play for other Hip-Hop crews
It ain't about you, we're doing what we like do
We're kicking treble clef, bass clef, rhyme like Amaru Bleth
Flying from the right, kicking it dead from the left
We take a drum role, and put it under our rhyme
Make it hit yet on time, like this;
You think that you're rocking but you're not hip-hopping
So you best stop jocking at the masters
MCs, you like the way we swing?

[Tupac Shakur]
You like the way we swing?
UHH! cause America, loves the way we swing

[Shock G & Money B]
MCs, you like the way we swing? 
Queen Latifah told you that you're nothing but an underling
Oh! yeah, you better believe it, we're kicking it kind of cocky
You can't deny it though the drums are good and sloppy
The funky beat is playing and we're swinging along
The Underground is rocking with the hip-hop song
The funky drums is ringing with the serious tone
I clop this y'all, we're on the microphone
Now MCs, like the way we swing? You like the way we swing
Yeah, cause America, likes the way we swing

[Tupac Shakur]
UHH, No, that
 ain't it G Freestyle and chill
No, sorry Hump, cool out! NO!

[Shock G & Tupac] 
You're not coming off, you rhyme like a school teacher
About convincing as a preacher, who smokes reefer
Why don't you give it up? - just put the mic down little boy
You're a toy to the underground
The funky beat is playing and we're swinging along
The Underground is rocking with the hip-hop song
The funky drums is ringing with the serious tone
I clop this y'all, we're on the microphone
Now MCs, like the way we swing? You like the way we swing
HUH! cause America, loves the way we swing
I said America, loves the way we swing
Yeah, America, loves the way we swing
They love the way we swing

[Shock G]
Well, listen close to make sure you don't miss a thing
