Hello friend,
I know you're smiling but believe it,
Don't have to pretend.
I know at times it seems your broken heart
Might never mend,
Hello friend.

Hello girl,
I had lost my faith in human kind,
Until your call.
It's nice to know you've been there for me
Through it all,
Hello girl.

Hello friend.

It is strange, the things you'll go through,
Til you finally realise You will realise,
That the things you need the most are always
Right before your eyes Before your eyes.
And the truth is always something
You would never know is true.
I guess I can't deny it, no you can't deny it.
I really need you.

Hello friend,
I never had the chance to say,
How much I really miss,
The things I'm finding so hard now, I can't resist.
Hello friend.

You came into my life.
And everything I need to know is in your eyes,
Hello girl.

And hello friend.

You will realise
And the truth is always something
You would never know is true.
I guess I can't deny it, no you can't deny it.
I really need you.
