He said,  You've got the goods to make the big time
And then he puffed on his cigar
We'll make a killing, We'll get top billing
I'm gonna make you a star

First we'll improve a bit on mother nature
I've got a doctor friend you see
Imagination, Plus augmentation
Viola! A brand new me

Up here in the big time, you need big time looks
A shady accountant who can cook the books
A couple of well-placed friends,
Some dynamite eight-by-tens
Before you can reap those big time dividends

Before you know it I was moving up there
Don Perignon and caviar
A late night  Yes sir , leads to good press sir
And takes a girl pretty far

So now my name's in lights above the title
Or it's not on the dotted line
On the back lots now, I call the shots now
When there's a contract to sign

I'm up in the big time, so I make them wait
I'm up in the big time, so I'm always late
I tell them all  Let's do lunch ,
Then give them that one, two, punch
I'm part of the big brass, first class, big time bunch

Big! Big time! Big time games!

I Hit the right places
I Cover my bases
I Do what I have to
Smile till it hurts baby,
Wear shorter skirts baby,
Cry in a pinch baby,
But I won't dare give a single square inch, baby!

Up here in the big time, I've got big time friends
Who wanna make sure my big time never ends
My motto is  I've got mine , I live on the bottom line
Up here in the a-team, wet dream, big, big time

It's comin' up roses,
And Barrymore noses
Worth all the sweat dear
Worth it? - You bet!
When you make the climb,
From the nickel and dime,
To the simply sublime...
Big time!
