From the Albums:
* Contraband
* Golden Earring Live

He split the racket, to operate on his own
He set them up, stripped them   then he was gone
He's a Robin Hood of a new century
If you're rich   dumb, you bleed, boy
Con man's got a bloodhound nose for flaws
Profits from both sides of the law
I feel sympathy for his philosophy
If you're clever you can beat them all
Sister, tell your mister - to hold on to his change
Hustler, call him hustler - Con man rides again
Bandits, he's the bandits - settin' up a frame
Sister, tell your mister - to hold onto his brains!
Con man's mastermindin' on a brand new heist
Blueprintin' through the secret files
Your tune ain't gonna be so nice
When he gets through with you
There's just one thing left to do...
Cause he'll take it away
One money hungry night
Your longs 're gonna be his guidin' lights
He'll be foolin' us all if we don't watch out
Leavin' his lies - spreadin' doubts all about!
Con man's got a bloodhound nose for flaws
Profits from both sides of the law
I feel sympathy for his philosophy
If you're clever you can beat them all
Sister, tell your mister - to hold on to his change
Hustler, call him hustler - Con man rides again
Bandits, he's the bandits - settin' up a frame
Sister, tell your mister - to hold onto his brains!
Con man's mastermindin' on a brand new heist
Somebody's in for a big surprise
Your wrongs're gonna be his rights
When a pro's at a con - he's the devil's son
Cause he'll take it away, etc.
He's the devil son
Sometimes I think I'm gonna study that game
Be a Con man myself some day
Just one thing botherin' me
I might be conning myself - by the way...
It's a quarter past five, and that's no lie
I'm glad we're all still alive, goodbye now
Look out, he's spreadin' those doubts all about
He's the devil son
