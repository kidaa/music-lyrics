My life was laid out like a map
I thought I had everything in my head
But one leads another
We never have each other
The one thing I never had was a holding hand

My time was passing by so slowly
I thought I had all the time in the world
But one needs another
And I never had another
The one thing I never had was a holding hand

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

My world came crashing to a halt
I thought it had died, I thought it was no more
But one loves another
And I never knew another
The only thing I needed was a holding hand

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

And when the worlds collide
They form a land bridge inside
That I just can't do without

And time, space, mind and soul
They pass on and on
But they just can't be whole
Without something to hold it all

My love came to find another love
I thought everything would be alright
And when one loves another
And when we love each other
That was I needed to save my skin
To save my skin
To save my skin

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
And take a breath and jump

So come to me
Come to me
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand and jump

And jump
Take my hand
Take my hand
Just jump
