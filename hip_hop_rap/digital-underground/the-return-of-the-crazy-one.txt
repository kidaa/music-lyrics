Do you love me baby?
I said Do you Do you love me baby?

I gotta know
Do you love me baby?
Do you lovvve me baby?
Do yah  repeated 13 times
Do you want me to

You make me weep and wanna die
Just when you said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other

When I'm alone all by myself
You're out
You're with somebody else
You're lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other

You're tearin' me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh girl what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart

It won't be long, yes till you're alone
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home
Cause he's lovin' oo, he's touchin' her,
He's squeezin' another

He's tearin' you apart
Yes every day, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
Cause he's lovin', touchin' another
Now it's your turn, girl to cry
Na na na na na na

Do yah da da da da da da da
