These tired lips are sealed
Although this angry mouth is filled
With words to fracture an unknowing heart
Enough to tear your very world apart

Turning my knowing look away
Fumbling for something to say
God only knows I've done things I regret
So many I'm trying hard to forget

So if you're wondering
You can be
Safe in the knowledge
That your secret's safe with me
Can't help wondering
What you'd do
If you found out she'd done the same to you

There's no logic, there's no gain
There's no way you can explain
Not that I want or expect you to
We're all the prisoners of the things we do

So if you're wondering
You can be
Safe in the knowledge
That your secret's safe with me
Can't help wondering
What you'd do
If you found out she'd done the same to you

Safe in the knowledge, safe
Safe in the knowledge, safe

So if you're wondering
You can be
Safe in the knowledge
That your secret's safe with me
Can't help wondering
What you'd do
If you found out she'd done the same to you
