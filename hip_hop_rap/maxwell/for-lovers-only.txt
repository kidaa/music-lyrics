This ain't for the ones
That just love for fun
That just love and run
that just hold the gun
This is for 
Those that bleed 
That want but have no need
This ain't for the war
this is only 

For Lovers only 
lovers only 
Strictly for the lovers only 
Who are lost and lonely

Ever since the way you looked at me 
love is not a want 
love is now a need

This is if you want to hold me
Or for lovers only 
not for the easy 
This ain't bout that style
Its about a take it day by day
its about a wait thats worth it baby 

Ever since the day you look at me
Ever since the way
love is not a want
love is now a need 
now a need 
not just cuz i got nobody 
not just cuz i got nobody 
This is only 

For Lovers only 
lovers only 
Strictly for the lovers only 
Who are lost and lonely

Ever since the day you look at me
Ever since the way
love is not a want
love is now a need 
now a need 
not just cuz i got nobody 
not just cuz i got nobody 
This is only 

For Lovers only 
lovers only 
Strictly for the lovers only 
Who are lost and lonely
