You stung, as if you knew I'd sting right there 
And you shouldn't know these things about me 
Abused as if your pain would quench my fear 
How could you know these things about me 

You shouldn't know these things 
And be this awfully well in tune 
Go as if not aware be like those others that assume 
You knew and you still managed to find my stare 
And you shouldn't know these things about me 

You shouldn't know these things about me 
And be this awfully well in tune 
Go on as if not aware 
Go on and be those that presume 
That they could know these things about me 

Be as if not aware 
Be mystified as this appears 
Lay still, be as my will 
And promise that you'll wait to kill 
And whisper that you know these things 
Tell me you know these things 
Show me you know these things 
About me
