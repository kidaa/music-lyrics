I was reborn when I was broken
I wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no
been thru a storm, no use in hoping
that you would come rescue me
somehow your love set me free

And I, I can let my life pass me by
or I can get down and try
work it all out this lifetime
work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
or I can get down and try
work it all out this lifetime lifetime

There was a time when love wasn't chosen
now I'm just open for more
now I'm just reaching out for something better
that I had before, girl
there ain't a bottom line in your world

Ooh and I, I can let my life pass me by
or I can get down and try
work it all out this lifetime
work it on out this time

I can let it all pass me by
or I can just try and try
I can move to the light
oh if I take it one day at a time oh I
oh spread my love out and fly 
oh I I can move to the light
ooh I can just make you understand
that love is not a fairytale in a melody
if you want it you can have it girl
maybe you will see maybe you will see ooh ooh
ooh oh oh wo oh
lifetime lifetime
