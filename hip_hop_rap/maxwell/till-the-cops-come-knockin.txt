Didn't you dig the way I rubbed yo back girl 
Wasn't it cool when first I kissed yo lips 
Was it enough to penetrate yo dark world 
Or were you embarrassed about the way you freaked 
Well I wanna hold you 
I wanna know you baby 
If it's alright 

[1] - Gonna take you in the room suga' 
Lock you up and love for days 
We gonna be rockin baby 
Till the cops come knockin 
Pappa gonna have to leave 
A message on the telephone baby 
There won't be no stoppin' me 
Till the cops come knockin' 

Six on a Thursday night and you be jonesin baby 
For a brother to hold you tight and keep on goin 
Last lover came and went 
Didn't even hug n' kiss you n' caress you 
Gimme a call it's cool the M's all open 
Im open wider than oceans 
I'll be your lotion 
If it's alright 

Gonna take you in the room suga' 
Lock you up and love for days 
We gonna be rockin baby till the cops come knockin 

[Repeat 1]

Please you tease you eat you 
Make you feel so good inside 
Loving you long if that's alright 

Gonna take you in the room suga' 
Lock you up and love for days 
We gonna be rockin baby till the cops come knockin 

[Repeat 1]
