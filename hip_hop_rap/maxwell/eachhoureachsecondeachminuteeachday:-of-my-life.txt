How can I do wrong babe 
When right is where your heart is near me 
With each and every song baby 
You are my only source of melody, 
Baby girl come on baby girl come on come on 
Keep it there till dawn baby 
Till comes the coming second coming all over me ooh oooh 

[1] - Do me till I'm done 
Do me till I'm done 
Do me till I'm done 
Till comes up the sun 
Moon goes where it's from 
Till morning comes 
Sideways, upside down 
Ceiling or the ground 
Till my lost is found 
EachHourEachSecondEachMinuteEachDay of my life baby 
Each night of my life baby 

With every other breath baby I drown, 
You always make the rain baby like sunshine 
It's like I never ever doubted me 
It's like I'm almost close to diggin me 
You made what I was missing baby all mine 
Keep doing it on and on 

[Repeat 1]

Do me till I'm done 
Till my lost is found 
EachHourEachSecondEachMinuteEachDay of my life baby 
Each night of my life baby 

Do me till I'm done 
Till my lost is found 
EachHourEachSecondEachMinuteEachDay of my life baby 
Each night of my life baby 

[Repeat 1]
