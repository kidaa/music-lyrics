Pray God you can cope
I stand outside
This woman's work
This woman's world
Ooooh it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the Father

I know you've got a little life in you left
I know you've got a lot of strength left
I know you've got a little life in you yet
I know you've got a lot of strength left

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
All the things we should've said that I never said
All the things we should have done that we never did
All the things we should have given but I didn't

Oh darling make it go
Make it go away

Give me these moments
Give them back to me
Give me that little kiss
Give me your ...
I know you have a little life in you yet
Give me your hand babe
I know you have a lot of strength left
Give me your prayers
I know you have a little life in you yet
Ooooh oooh oooh
I know you have a lot of strength left
Your loved child
I know you have a little life in you yet
Whatever you need baby
I know you have a lot of strength left
Give me your hand
I know you have a little life in you yet
Give me you hand
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things we should've said that we never said
All the things we should have done that we never did
All the things that you wanted from me
All the things that you needed tell me
All the things I should have given but I didn't
Oh darling make it go away
Just make it go away now
