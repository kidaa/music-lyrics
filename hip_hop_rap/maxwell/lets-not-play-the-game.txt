[1] - So if this is you 
Here's what you should do 
Don't even come up 
Don't even say stuff 
You know it ain't true 
Baby what's the use 
Let's not play the game 

She used to be the dreams I'd dreamed of 
The air that I breathe 
The words I speak of 
But in reality the girl was out for gold, yeah 
Honey, honey let's not proceed 
If it's because 
You're out for cheese 
If it's just the 
Things associated with me 
Girl don't play no roles 

[Repeat 1]

Let's not play the game 
Let's not play the game 
Don't get me wrong cause I still believe 
Baby, baby I still believe 
That love is all that ever was 
And love is all that it ever will be 
See but it's about honesty so 
So let's not play the game 
Let's not play the game 

[Repeat 1]

Let's not play the game 
Let's not play the game

Let's not play the game 
Let's not play the game 

All I ever wanted to give you was a little bit of lovely 
Let's not play the game 
All I ever wanted to give you was a little bit of happy 
Let's not play the game 
No but apparently all you really wanted was the money 
Let's not play the game 
Let's not 
Let's not play the game 
Let's not play the game
