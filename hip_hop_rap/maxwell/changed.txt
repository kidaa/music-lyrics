Uh ah ooh

Back when I was 4 or 3
clouds came rushing round into my sunshine
clouds got a hold of me they brought me way, way down
clouds so my baby believed but you were not around

So now what you trying to be
what you trying to, trying to do to me
you got me catching feelings with an urgency 
now that I've changed my mind

Sorry I wasn't sure of your love
ooh sorry so once afraid that you would figure out the crutch
then make a move and come and go and go and leave
me like the others left me, when things got deep
before you make me go girl, promise you won't do that to me
mmnm baby

Now what you trying to be
what you trying to, trying to do to me
you got me catching feelings in the third degree
now that I've changed my mind

Everything was just fine
when you wanted to ruin my life
now it's plain and easy for me to see
now that I've changed my mind
oh

Now that I don't want to settle the score
game I ain't never felt so free
now that I don't want to hurt no more
there's plenty more left for me

Cuz everything was just fine
you wanted to ruin my life
I'ts plain for me to see and it's plain and easy for me to see
now that I've changed my mind
