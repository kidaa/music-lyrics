Over to under 
Enter your wonder baby 
Submerge into me baby 
And take me to higher 

Submerge within the light 
Illuminate my night 
And let your atmosphere surround me 
Submerge within the light all night 
Till we become the sun 

See if I'm breathing 
Because I'm not sure 
Tonight if I'm alive 
Words are demeaning 
They can't describe 

Submerge within the light 
Til we become the sun
