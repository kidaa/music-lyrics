If I had to do it over 
If I had to do it again 
I would've know to 
This would've never began 
If I made you claustrophobic 
Imagine if I gave you an inch 
You'll never notice 
But there's NoOne quite like you 

CHORUS: 
I try to forget ya 
But you're all I wanna do 
I could do better 
But there's NoOne quite like 
NoOne quite like you 
repeat 

If I made you love me again 
If I made you want me again 
If I gave it you probably wouldn't want it babe 
It's all-right cuz there's 
NoOne quite like you 

CHORUS: 
I try to forget ya 
But you're all I wanna do 
I could do better 
But there's NoOne quite like 
NoOne quite like you 

repeat till end
