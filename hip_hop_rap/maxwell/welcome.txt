I guess it never was 
The way I thought it was 
I say this only just because 
You never came to love 
I guess it wasn't so 
Guess that's how the story goes 
You didn't dig my flow 
You didn't dig my flow 

[1] - But you're still welcome,welcome 
Anytime you want some 
Make yourself at home cause you're 
Welcome 

Tonight will make one week 
Tonight's the anniversary 
And if you don't talk to me 
Tomorrow will never be 

[Repeat 1]

Six in the morning everything's nothing 
Six in the eve everything's still the same 
Wish you knew I just wish that you knew that 
I really love you deep like a mother loves a child 
I wanna love you like hot water running wild 
Inside you momma sophisticated style 
Check my dictionary 

I guess it never was the way I thought it was 
I say this only because 
You never came to love 
Welcome
