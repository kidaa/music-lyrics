Yeah, look at you
Look at you
You look fine
How do you do
Been a while since alone in your room room
Been around, but haven't found
No one like you no one like you
Don't you know girl
There's no one like you

And you hear me
Hear my emotions creep slowly
Hear with your heart, baby
Don't speak
Now with your soul tell me
Silently

Tell me you know each thought without a word
You see me through you see me through
Sorry now sorry now that I ever doubted you
I don't know what I can do
To make you come true
Think that you should know
There's no one like you and how you are

Your mind and heart
Nine times the soul ooh
Nine times the soul
There's no one like you

Can you hear me hear me baby
