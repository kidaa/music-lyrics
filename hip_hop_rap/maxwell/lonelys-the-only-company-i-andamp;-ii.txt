[1] - Lonely's the only other company 
Less you're the love no other love can be 

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Since you went away my heart 
It's ripped into shreds torn apart 
come back baby 
Cause baby 

[Repeat 1]

Since you went away I just 
 I cry baby I cry baby 
Look into all of the faces with no trust 
no trust no trust 

Lonely's the one 
Lonely's the one 
And I'm lonely just because 
You left me lonely 
Oh baby 
Lonely's the only other company baby! 
Lover there ain't no other 
Since you went away from me
