[Intro:]
Whispers passed in silence 
Two lovers passing in the night 
A love that's left and hopeless 
That can never survive 

[1] - What are we gonna do 
What are they gonna to say 
Where are we gonna to go 
When they find out 

What are we gonna do 
What are they gonna say 
Where are we gonna go 
When they find out 

Sing your song, sing your song, sing your song 
Really don't know you well 
Got to get to know me too 
So see, we can make this work 
Through your friends won't approve 

See, we can't let them know 
Exactly what's going on 
Cuz they won't understand 
What we have between us 

[Repeat 1]

Woody, Woody, Woody, Woddy 
I know we may be rushing 
There's no time to think it through 
Cuz when love overcomes your heart 
There's nothing you can do 

Misery loves company 
By now you should know 
People always have advice about being together 
When they're all alone 

I cry 
I cry, I cry, late at night baby 
Inside 
Inside my heart babe 
I was all alone 
Don't you let no God damn body come near 
And tear our love apart 
Cuz I love you girl 
You're all my world 
So what are we gonna do 

What are we gonna do 
I feel so afraid, babe 
Feel like a baby 
Just hold me darling 
And let me know 
I need to know 
I've got to know 
What are we, oh baby 

[Repeat 1 x2]

What are we gonna do 
Oh well, well, well, well, well, well 
Oh baby, well, well, well, well
