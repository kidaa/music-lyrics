[Intro:]
What do I do, what do I do babe 

I can put away the letters 
Hide them in the drawer 
I can even forget what you sent them for 
And I can take your name out of my book 
I can put away the pictures 
I can put the dreams aside 
But I just can't seem to put you out of my mind 
So tell me now, oh 

What do I do with the love, tell me baby 
What do I do with the memories of 
What do I do with the nights 
Without you by my side 
They used to be your's and mine 
Without you, what do I do with the love 

I can go out every night now 
Stay out til the dawn 
Do whatever I want to 
Anytime I want 
And I can make believe we never met 
I can clear out all the closets 
Leave your things ouside the door 
But I just can't seem to not love you anymore 
So tell me now, tell me now, what do I do 

What do I do with the love Oh baby 
What do I do with the memories of Tell me 
What do I do with the nights Baby

They used to be your's and mine 
Without you what do I do with the love, yeah yeah 

Do do I do with this heart 
Who do I give it to 
What do I do with these arms 
If they're not holding you 
What do I do with this time 
If I'm not spending time with you 
If I'm not giving my love to you, oh 

What do I do with the love, 
Oh, Lord have mercy, do ya hear me
