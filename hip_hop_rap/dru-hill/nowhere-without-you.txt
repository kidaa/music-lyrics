Remember us from "Tell Me" 
And sleeping "In My Bed" 
We "Never Made A Promise" 
And "Five Steps" 
"April Shower" me with love 
"So Special" to me 
There's so much more to Dru Hill 
Than what the eye can see 

We want you to know we love you 
We want you to know we need you 
Where would we be without you 
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere 

You feel it in our music 
Because of you we do this 
We're never gonna lose it 
No way, no way, no way, no way
