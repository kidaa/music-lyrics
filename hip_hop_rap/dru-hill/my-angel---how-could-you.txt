This is dedicated to my real angel Ms. Joan I Milburn Green love you mommy

You taught me everything 
In life I'd need
Sometimes I felt you were
My everything
And if it were all left up to me
You'd be right beside me
But you're gone
Although I know
You're in a better place
So selfishly
I wish you could've stayed
How I long to hear you call my name
Lord give me the strength to carry on
And on
If you talk to my angel'
The one who carried me and gave me life
Could you tell her that I love her
And I can't wait to see her on the other side
Wooh [4x's]
Do Do Do Do Do
Rest in peace mommy 
I love you
