[Intro:]
Can I talk to you for a second 
Got something I wanna say 

I'm remembering in the first days 
You would never ever leave me alone 
But now it seems here lately, baby 
That you are always gone 

So tell me what am I suppose to do 
Should I stay and wait for you 
My heart is slowly aching for your love 
And I don't know what to do so 

[1] - Give me one good reason 
I should stay 
Your love is out of season 
Be on your way 
My eyes are tired of crying 
So what are we gonna do 
So give me one good reason 
Why I should stay with you 

Our love is like an hour glass 
You know we're running out of time 
How could you go and do this to me 
When you know it's messing with my mind 
I was there when you needed me 
So why can't you see 
I know you say that you love me baby 
But your friends, they come before me, so baby 

[Repeat 1]

I can't explain, no, no 
How the joy you've given me has turned to pain 
See I'm not gonna cry no more baby 
I'm walking out the door, baby 
There's one thing I know for sure 
Yeah yeah, yeah, baby 

[Repeat 1]

Give me one more reason 
Your love is out of season 
I'm tired of trying to please you 
So that's why I'm leaving you 
Your love is out of season
