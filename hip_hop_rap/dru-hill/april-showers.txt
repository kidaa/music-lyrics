[Woody]
Loving you is all I need 
Never take your love from me 
Cuz I think I would lose my mind 
If you would go away 
Oh, say you'll never leave my side, 
That forever you'll be mine 
Oh April Shower me with your love 
And girl i'll give you all the love i have inside this heart of mine 
And yes i swear that i'll be here for you forever and all time 
So,if ever you feel lonley all you have to do is call me 
And i'll be there to shower you with my love 

[2nd verse]
Heavean must of smiled on me 
Like it did the earth that day 
When god created the sun and said let there be light 
So i write your name across my heart 
And proclaim it to the stars above 
Oh April Shower me with your love 
And girl i'll give you all the love i have 
Inside this heart of mine 
And yes i swear that i'll be here 
For you forever and all time 
So if ever you feel lonley 
All you have to do is call me 
And i'll be there to shower you with my love 
Baby
