[Intro:]
Yo, yo, can ya'll hear me out there 
Cool ,cool 
Allow me to introduce myself, ladies and gentlemen 
See, I go by the name of Big Woody Rock 
And I'd just like to take this time right here to just first of all thank you all 
For taking the time out to listen to this album 
Hope you're enjoying everything you're hearing so far 
But right now I just think I need to dedicate this song 
This next song coming up, to every man, woman, boy, girl 
Who ever and where ever you may be 
Who's ever been in a relationship that just didn't quite work out 

Also this song is dedicated to everybody who comes up to me in all the clubs 
Supermarkets, airports, and every where else in the world 
Asking me "Woody when you goin' do something When they goin' let you sing" 
Not knowing that I sang all of "April Showers" 
A verse on "All Alone", a verse on "5 Steps" and 'bout half the songs on the album 
But that's cool, ya'll ain't know, but right now I just want you to sit back 
Close your eyes, kick your feet up and listen to this song right here 
Cuz this here is for y'all 
Yo, smiley you ready 
Lets do this

Girl, it's been so long 
Since I held you in my arms 
So I picked up pen and paper 
And decided to write you a song 

Things just ain't the same 
Since you took your love away 
All I have is dark and lonely days 
Cuz the sun don't shine my way 

Wish that I can find the words 
To say to show you love is real 
The words just can't express the way I feel 

[1] - You're my angel 
My sun up in the sky 
We've been through hell and back together 
Why you wanna leave me now 
Only you can ease the pain I feel 
And wipe my tears away 
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again 

Baby not a day goes by 
That I don't want to cry 
When I think of what we had 
And how you walked out of my life 

All I had was yours to take 
Till my heart you chose to break 
Still wish that I can make love to you 
Just one more time for old times sake 

If only I could find the words 
To say to show you love is real 
The words just can't express the way I feel 

[Repeat 1]

Come back home 
Come back home 
Cuz without you here beside me, girl 
My house is not a home 

Only you can ease the pain I feel 
And wipe my tears away 
Won't you fly back home 
And make me whole again 

Cuz you're my angel 
My sun up in the sky 
We'be been through hell and back together 
Why you wanna leave me now 
Only you can ease this pain I feel 
And wipe my tears away 
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again 

You're my angel 
My sun up in the sky 
We've been through hell and back together 
Why you wanna leave me now 
Only you can ease the pain I feel 
And wipe my tears away 

You've been gone too long 
So won't you come back home
