You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
Without you I can't do a thing

Girl I wonder what went wrong, where we fell apart
From a love that was so strong, I wonder where our
thoughts got lost, somewhere
twisted and now, I'm trying to pull myself from off the ground
girl I just wanna know where, how, and who are you loving now.
I need you now
we need to work it out somehow
cuz I can see a part of me
with you is where I need to be

I wanna know why, where, who's gonna love you if I'm gone and girl I swear I'll hold on...
You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
...Cuz without you I can't do a thing

Where, who's gonna love you if I'm gone. And girl I swear I'll hold on...
You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
...Without you I can't do a thing

I'm puzzled
my heart is slowly dying cuz I don't know
why I keep on trying when you're so cold
why I keep on crying only Heaven knows
it's something deep inside I just can't let it go
I'm about to lose my mind, girl I can't sleep no more
can't eat no more, girl I'm falling down
this is all because we had a falling out
I never meant to go that route
Won't you pull me from the pain I feel inside
enough to make the strongest man break down and cry
would you come and wipe these teardrops from my eyes
losing you is like losing my mind, cuz I need you in my life
I wanna know...

...Why, where, who's gonna love you if I'm gone, and girl I swear I'll hold on...
You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
...Cuz without you I can't do a thing

Where, who's gonna love you if I'm gone, and girl I swear I'll hold on...
You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
...Without you I can't do a thing

I've loved you all my life
And I've learned sometimes make sacrifice
do whatever it takes
to make love turn around

You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
Without you I can't do a thing
You know I never stopped wanting you
You know I never stopped needing you
You know I never stopped loving you
Without you I can't do a thing

Baby I can't live another day
without you in my life won't be the same.
What will I do
can't take the pain
What will I do
won't be the same
What will I say
girl things have changed

Come back to me, come back to me baby.
Come back to me, come back to me baby.
Come back to me, come back to me baby...
