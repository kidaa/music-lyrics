Yo, we gonna try something a little different
Yo, make.. make my voice a little more distorted
Yeah, I don't know if they ready for this
Uh dance, uh uh dance, uh uh dance, uh uh dance
Uh uh, verse
Last night we had an argument
Afterwards I'm feelin' pretty bent
Then I took a drink, and I didn't think
What was in store for me

[Chorus 1]
You don't know, you don't know how she'll take it
Tell me what a simple man could do 
Will she cherish your heart, will she break it
Cuz you are everything and everything is you, sing

[Chorus 2]
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

Listen, baby don't you play me
When You're lovin' me, When You're holdin' me 
And oh what u say to me
Are u playin me
Are u playin me
You're everything to me
Thats one reason you will be
That i will love you always

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Break it down, oh
[Ja Rule]
Yeah huh, Ja Rule and Dru Hill, nigga
Baby girl, you tellin' lies
Cuz when I look at you in your face
I could see I'm on your mind
And it don't matter what them hoes may say
I know your love is blind for me
Every bitch needs a thug nigga in their life
Truly, could it be, could it be
You enjoy me f**kin' you while you be lovin' me
Bitch destroy hoes mentally
That's why they freak with me, frequently
Love is life

[Nokio]
No nigga, life is love
Take her bad and just ice her up
Haven't toured, rather keep in touch

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, that's what's up

[Nokio]
Being Nokio's a bit much
Y'all bitches overseas that love to f**k
Y'all bitches in the states that love to suck
What the f**k y'all want from me
Ghetto celebrity from B'more

[Ja Rule]
Murderer, Do Or Die from the N-Y

Nokio and Ja Rule-
Now everyone get right

[Nokio]
N-O-K-I-O baby

[Ja Rule]
R to the U to L-E, baby
And yo, we lie to y'all bitches, hate me
Baby, cuz ya can't relate to me
What the f**k you want from me?

[Nokio]
And them hoes don't matter, a thing
Had your bracelet, earring, rings cuz you know

You are everything
[Chorus 2]
