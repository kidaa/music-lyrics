I'll be the one 
I'll be the one 

I heard a rumor there's a vacancy 
Somebody said he put you down 
Seems he found pleasure in some other girl 
Baby, he's dogging you around 

So now yhou're looking for a special guy 
Someone that you can call your boo 
A man that cares about your feelings girl 
A man to just be good to you 
Well 

[1] - I'll be the one making you feel alright 
I'll be the one doing the things you like 
I'll be the one keeping you up at night 
I'll be the lover in your life 

I'll be the one you're gonna wanna call, yeah 
I'll be the one making you climb the walls 
I'll be the one gon' have you beggin' me 
I'll be the one, the one you need 

You gave him seven years of your life 
To think about it akes you cry 
Why don't you come with me 
I'll make it right 
Let's bump that nigga outta your mind 
Let's take a ride baby, no special place, yeah 
Somewhere where we can be alone, hey 
Take off our clothes and let our feelings flow 
I wanna groove you all night long 
I'll be the one 

[Repeat 1]

Here's the thing you should know about me, yeah 
Jazz is the man when it comes to ladies 
I know what I want 
Baby I'm keepin' it real, said real babe 
Ain't no him now that you're with me 
That's the way that it's gotta be 
If you're down, then be down 
Don't be playin' around with my heart, oh no 
I'll be the one 

[Repeat 1]

I'll be the one 
I'll be the one
