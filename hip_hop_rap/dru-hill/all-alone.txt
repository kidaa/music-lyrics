[Verse 1 Woody]
I'm gonna stay to myself 
Where there's no one else around me 
I'm gonna stay to myself 
So there's no one else to find me 
That's what I'm gonna do 
My baby love if I can't have you 
Maybe I'm better off on my own 

[verse 2 Jazz]
If I pray to myself 
Maybe God above will hear me 
And if it is in his will 
Then he'll send you right back to me 
I'll hold my feelings inside so that you won't see me cry 
I hope it's all in my mind cause I'm scared. 

[verse 3 Nokio]
I'm gonna chill to myself 
Leave the stress of a world from inside me 
I'm gonna walk all alone 
And leave all my troubles behind 
That's what a man has to do 
In his life just to make it through 
I'm gonna chill to myself 

[chorus]
All Alone 
Since you left me baby I've been steady cryin' 
All Alone 
Wonderin' if you ever really truly loved me 
All Alone 
I'll never give my heart again 
Baby I've got to be alone 
Baby can't you see just what is happening to me 
All Alone 
Won't you come along and baby rescue me 
All Alone 
I can't stand being all alone 
And I'll Never 
Be alone again 

[bridge]
Another time, Another place, Another love 
Maybe it will happen then, but I won't live my life on faith 
So I'll keep my tears inside and drift away 
Where I'm all alone 

[chorus]
