[Spoken:]
I just can't believe it, girl 
I can't believe that it's over 
But I'm your man, and I'll be alright 
But still, the love we had 
Stays on my mind 

Lately baby, I've been thinking 
How good it was when you were here 
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking 
For once I feel my head is clear 

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes 
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise 
I guess you meant more to me than I realized 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 

And lately girl, I've been remembering 
The good times that we used to share 
My thoughts of you don't have an ending 
And memories of you are everywhere 

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern 
You win some, you lose some 
Well I've lost and I've learned 
Sisqo's so lonely 
With no place to turn 
And here at the end, I find 
Yes I do 

The love we had stays on my mind 
Girl, if you were nearer 
If you had a mirror 
Maybe you could count my tears 

And if you were nearer 
It would all be clearer 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish that you were here 
How I wish, how I wish 
How I wish that you were here 

And baby girl I was tired 
So I laid down to dream for a little while 
But lately I've been so, so uninspired 
Without the comfort of your smile 

But I'm not complaining 
Cuz that's how it goes 
There's always some heartache 
In this world I suppose 
But you can't imagine 
But nobody knows 

The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind 
The love we had stays on my mind
