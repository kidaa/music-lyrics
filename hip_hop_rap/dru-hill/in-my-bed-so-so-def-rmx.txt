[Jermaine Dupri]
You wanna dance
Ha, I'ma make you dance
You wanna move
Ha, I'ma make you move
Dru Hill come on

[Dru Hill]
I got this feeling
I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around
Like I was your fool
Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me bout things going on
But deep in my heart babe
I hope that I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Sleepin' in bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
Takin my place, Oh oh

I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face
Written on your face
Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door
But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me things are still the same
Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name

[Chorus]

What else did you want
What else did you need
Giving you everything plus my heart
I gave you the world Yes I did
Cause you were my girl Oh yes I
But you still ran out on me

[Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, fly shit, differnt colors whips
I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips
Got too many

[Da Brat]
My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family

[Jermaine Dupri]
Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs
And now I keep it commin' stong till the early morn

[Da Brat]
Lemme interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit

[Jermaine Dupri]
I make em sick cause I'm the williest

[Da Brat]
Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch

[Jermaine Durpi]
Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal

[Da Brat]
Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers

[Jermaine Dupri]
We make believers out of dreamers

[Chorus till fade...]
