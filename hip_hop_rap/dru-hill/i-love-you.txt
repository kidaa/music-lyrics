[Nokio:]
The beauty's gone

[Sisqo:]
My time wasn't enough I'm spendin it all with you
My heart wasn't enough I'm givin' it to you
My money wasn't enough I'm givin' you all that
My house wasn't enough but you live in that
And now you  wanna leave

[Verse One Sisqo:]
Wish I never told you "you should leave"
Wish me and you never had my seed
No I better stop it that's a lie
Cuz girl you were the apple of my eye
Took a little time for me to see
That girl I need you right here next to me
I done let you walk away
But I'm not goin out that way, no

[Hook:]
Not that way
Not goin out that way
I can't live without you
Can't be without you
I'm beggin' you to stay, to stay

[Chorus:]
I love you
And even though I'm sayin that you can leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
I still believe in you and me, I love you
Won't you take the time Love you
Take the time to see Leave me
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free Adore you, I'm in love
Don't give our love away

[Verse Two Scola:]
Words can't describe how I feel about you
Only Heaven knows how much I do
Girl I'll put my own life on the line
I'd cherish and protect you with my life
All that s*** I said girl I didn't mean
I'd die without your love baby if you leave
I could let you walk away
But baby I'm not goin out that way

[Hook:]
Not that way
Not goin out that way
Cuz I can't live without you
Can't be without you
I'm beggin you to stay, oohhh

[Chorus:]
I love you
And even though I'm sayin you can leave me I was just bulls***tin baby
I wanted other chances to adore you I was just f***in around
Cuz I still believe in you and me, yeah
Won't you take the time Love you 
Take the time to see Leave me take the time
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free Adore you I don't wanna live my life without you here

[Nokio:]
Might as well just kill me

[Bridge:]
All My Life all my, my life, I'd sacrifice for you
Sacrifice baby, I'd sacrifice for you, baby I'd sacrifice
After that rising sun
Is another day begun
I won't live without you
Won't be without you
I'm beggin you to stay Can't you just understand I just don't wanna be with you
Please stay

[Chorus:]
I love you
And even though I'm sayin you can leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
Gonna take my time, take my time, to give you the love that you want
Won't you take the time Love you 
Take the time to see Leave me 
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free Adore you

Cuz I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you 
I love you, baby
And I still believe in you and me

I love you
oh, I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I do
Waitin for you
For you, baby
I love you

[Nokio:]
We need each other
I taught you how to love 
You taught me how to love
And from that we created love I love you
You stayed with me when I was doin' wrong
So why'd you leave me when I started doin right
The beauty's gone
I love you
I love you
