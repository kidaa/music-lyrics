I don't have to think about it 
I ain't never been in love 
Well I've only dreamed about it 
But now I think I know it's clear to me 
You've made me understand 
I promise I'll never hurt 
you/ I'll never make you cry 
I promise I'll never hit you 
Cross my heart and hope to die 
I know I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you warm 
I'll keep you satisfied 
Be your sunshine in the morning 
Be your everything at night 

[Chorus:]
You told me what you needed 
I gave you what you need 
I told ya that I'd love you, make it good for you and me 
I never make a promise that I can't keep, that ain't me 

Ain't no way to get around it 
No cause now you're stuck with me 
Did you know that yo'd be surrounded 
By my love and ecstacy 
This is the staart of one great love afair 
That never, never, never ends 
We can share the world together 
This is where it begins 
Girl, I'll stand by you, Give me your hand 
I'll make love to you baby, Your wish is my command 
Let play out your fantasies I'll make you u lose your mind 
Take you places you ain't been, I promise you in time 

[Repeat Chorus]
