Does anybody stay together any more
Seems like love nowadays doesn't endure ooooh
We havent always Gotten along
But I stayed cause I always saw this day
And I wanna say

[Chorus]
Millions didn't make it But our Love
One of the ones that did {ooooo yeaah}
I knew that we could make it {me and you baby}
Please be my wife, grow [old] with me {Hoooooo}
Millions didn't make it But our Love {ours was a love that}
One of the ones that did {we made it baby}
I knew that we could make it {I want you to be}
Please be my wife, be one with me

[Verse 2: Sisqo]
From the first time I saw you
I knew that you were God's gift to me
And I found my greater strength in you
Cause no one in this world 
was more precious to me than you baby

[Chorus x 1/2]

[B-Section]
I'm saying I do, 
I Do, I Do [Repeat x 6]

[Bridge]
I'm gonna love you forever
Millions Never Made it
But Our Love Did
