Baby, I would like to reminisce
All times that we were intimate because some things have changed
Baby, I would like to recognize
When I was sexy in your eyes things are just not the same

[Hook:]
Oooooo baby
I've got to see if I can still take ya higher
Would you mind if I do it baby
Oooooo baby
I've got to see if I can still light ya fire

[Chorus:]
Gimme some of that old love oooh
The love I used to get more of aw baby
Like when I first got to know ya like back in the day
Like the way we used to be gimme some
Gimme some of that old love oh
To make me feel like a soldier I salute ya baby
Better now that I'm older oh
Like the way we used to be

[Verse Two:]
[Jazz]
Baby, I would like to reconcile
With the passion that's now exiled because some things have changed
Baby, let's go back to yester-year
When the chemistry we had was here things are just not the same

[Hook:]
Oooooo baby
I've got to see if I can still take ya higher
I wanna see if I can light yo fire yeah
Oooooo baby
I've got to see if I can still light ya fire

[Chorus:]
Gimme some of that old love oh oh oh old love
The love I used to get more of more love
Like when I first got to know ya got to know ya babe
Like the way we used to be I want some of that
Gimme some of that old love old love
To make me feel like a soldier feel now...
Better now that I'm older lemme show you
Like the way we used to be

[Bridge:]
[Dru Hill]
Lemme show you howww we used to be, baby
[Sisqo]
We put out less candles
We would find new handles on each other, baby
[Dru Hill]
Howww we used to be, baby
[Sisqo]
We would tear out springs, baby
And we would make offspring baby

Oh
Remember when
Remember when, baby
Ooooo baby
Remember when
Remember when, baby

[Chorus repeats 3x with ad-libs]
