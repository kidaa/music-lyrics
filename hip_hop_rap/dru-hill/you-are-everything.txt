[Intro:] 
Can I play for you baby 
Hey yo Woody, help me out, yeah 
Hey yo Jazz, you chill for a minute, ya know 
Uh uh uh yeah 
You like that 
Gonna sing you a song 
Listen 

Last night we had an argument 
Afterwards, I'm feelin' pretty bent 
Then I took a drink and I didn't think 
What was in store for me 
So I wrote a letter 
Dropped it on the bedroom floor 
I never felt this way before, no 
I grabbed my coat and closed the door baby, I'm sorry 

Baby I'm sorry Oh yeah 
Sorry for what I've done Will you forgive me 
Will you forgive me and let me be your only one 
Cuz you are 

[1] - You are everything 
And I would give you anything 
Sorry for what I've done 
I wanna be your only one 

Girl I apologize for all your tears 
When you cried, sorry for what I've done 
I wanna be your only one 

[Sing it Jazz]
Girl I apologize for all the tears 
And all the lies 
And if by chance just one more chance 
I swear I'll be the epitome of a good man 

Baby I'm sorry I'm sorry 
Sorry for what I've done Baby 
Will you forgive me Hey, yeah 
And let me be your only one 
Cuz yo are 

[Repeat 1]

oh, oh, oh, come on 
You are everything 
And everything is you 
You are everything 
Yo yo everything I do 

You are everything 
And everything is you 
You are everything 
Girl, you're everything I do 

You are everything 
And everything is you 
You are everything 
Girl, you're everything I do 
Everything I do 

[Repeat 1]

You are everything 
And everything is you 
You are everything 
And everything is you
