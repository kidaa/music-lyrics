Two o'clock and I'm all alone 
Callin' you on the phone 
Wanna come over but you ain't home 
Get in my car and start to drive 
Yes, I gotta take a ride 
Cuz I feel lonely inside but 
Then I ran into your girlfriend 
Know she is your best friend 
And if we mess around our love will end 
But I gotta take a sneak peek 
Cuz the freak in me is beating me 
Telling me to creep, see 

[1] - I'm just wondering if you really know what's goin' on 
Do you really have a clue 
'Bout what I'm gonna do to you, hey 

I'm just wondering if you really know what's goin' on 
Do you really have a clue 
'Bout what I'm gonna do to you 

Now that we're here alone 
Had to unplug the phone 
Just in case she calls 
She'll think I'm not home 
I had something else to do 
But now I'm here with you 
What I had to do has turned into you 
She thinks that I'm faithful 
Cuz her ride is paid for 
And I bought a crib for her and her shorty 
Forbidden fruit is tasty 
But you gotta lace me I'm shady 
But you ain't worth my baby
