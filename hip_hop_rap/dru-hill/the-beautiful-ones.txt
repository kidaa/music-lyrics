Baby, baby,babyWhat's it gonna be
Is it him or me
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind baby
Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight
Oh baby, baby,baby
Don't my kisses please you right
You were so hard to find
The beautiful one's, they hurt you
Every time
Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life a vision in one's mind
The beautiful one'sThe beautiful one's
Always smash the picture
Always every timeIf I told you baby
That I was in love with youOh baby, baby, baby
If we got married
Would that be cool
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seem to lose
