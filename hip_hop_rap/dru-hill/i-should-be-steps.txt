Girl I know he ain't taking care of you
I can see it in your face 
And I know that's not the man that you really want
You know

[Sisqo:]
Yeah ..... 
Yeah ..... 
Whoa... 
Whooa....

[Verse 1]
Lies and deceit
I Know, you feel this with your man
cuz' within all I see
Is crying

I should be your boyfriend
Cuz' you know he's lying
It might seem like Im hating It might seem like Im hating
Girl Im just relating

[Chorus]
Step 1, Walk through that door
Step 2, Tell him, he's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now 3, come to me
Step 4, I love you more
You will see how love should be
But theres 4 steps to believe

[Verse 2]
Everytime, when .. he try .. be the one who would
Give you all, you deserve
Now he's not trying

I should be your boyfriend I should be your boyfriend
Cuz' you know he's lying Cuz you know he's lying
It might seem like Im hating It might seem like Im hating
But Im just relating

[Chorus]
Step 1, Walk through that door
Step 2, Tell him, he's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now 3, come to me
Step 4, I love you more
You will see how love should be
But theres 4 steps to believe

[Bridge]
Listen Babe
Your what Im looking for
Our love would mean much more
Sin what he's giving you
But you must let him know
That you can't take no more
Replace him with me Someone who loves you more
That be me
Send someone who deserves him someone who deserves him
Get it figure out
Got it all let down
Baby

[Chorus]
Step 1, Walk through that door
Step 2, Tell him, he's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now 3, come to me
Step 4, I love you more
You will see how love should be
But theres 4 steps to believe
[Repeat chorus until fade]
