Damn 
Check it out 

I can't remember why we fell apart 
Or even how the arguments all start 
I got this crazy thought running through my head 
Mmmm, you keep insisting on convincing me that nothing's changed 
And keep on telling me I'm trippin' but it's not a game 
Cuz something's different when I'm in it, it don't feel the same 
I keep on picturing another nigga been hold-n-you 

[1] - I feel somebody's been touch-n-you 
In fact I know somebody's been kissin' you 
Do you wanna tell me who's been love-n-you , love-n-you 

Hold-n-you, I don't know why I been trusting you 
Only did what I'm supposed to do 
I don't know how I been such a fool for love-n-you 

It never really mattered too much to me 
I guess I was too blind and I could not see 
The message in the words that I heard you say 
Hmmm, that you're unhappy and you think you need some time away 
These things just happen but I know they don't happen that way 
I try and understand because I love you 
But I keep on thinking that another nigga been hold-n-you
