Nobody dead knew they would die before they woke
It probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last night's pussy the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin from a nightmare mind on a c-note
You leave the door open of intensions of fulfillin your visions
Constantly sidetracked thinking about who's your man and who isn't
Maybe its necessary...maybe you're overreacting
Maybe your actual downfall is that hole that you clappin
Maybe ya pullin conversations that are controllin ya actions
Maybe your homie overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corna
Cause death has promised ya you seen some niggas go before ya
N' threats are honestn with that lingering in the back of ya head
Ya know it's possible that you wont make back in ya bed
The confusion of jealously and dishonor'll spin ya
But there's nothing that hurt worse then when that gun powders in ya

[Chorus: Ft. Nate Dogg]

If you my nigga you my nigga till the end whoa
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a benz my friend....whoa
Let's toast till we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky na na na
If you my nigga you my nigga till we go whoa
One of the few I would take a bullet fo my neegaaaro...whoa
Let's toast till we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky na na na

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

The smell of marijuana reeks off me
I raise hell before I speak softly
Caught in the mix
Put at least a hundred grand on one and bought him a six
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man he taught him to fix
We aint never left the hood so we cam corded the trips
I've done watched a nigga go from BET to the bricksshit
Her slanted eyes with ya chocolate Thai gave me
Im a bachelor... nigga u aint knockin my lady
A lot of these niggas been jockin mine lately
N' I hope you catch the long nap, rock-a-bye baby gun shot
When 2 brothers, pushed outta different mamas
Close enough to conflict or put this shit behind us
ya baby boy made the big time
Hoes is watching n' these niggas trying to get mine
Remember back then with lines n' ya flattop
Hoping ya moms aint the mama on crack rock

[Chorus: Ft. Nate Dogg]

If you my nigga you my nigga till the end whoa
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a benz my friend....whoa
Let's toast till we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky na na na
If you my nigga you my nigga till we go whoa
One of the few I would take a bullet fo my neegaaaro...whoa
Let's toast till we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky na na na

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]

I keep my mind on my money and my head to the sky
I never really smile much if you was here you'd know why
There's frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin me up, right hookin my high
Niggas hated on us before the game took us inside
then they opened their arms wide took the whooping' n' cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin' on the wall in my crib
And handsome is one of the things they've been callin the kid
They watch you close when you coppin all those VS stones
If you ain't tryin to get it poppin leave the BS home
I've got us a ditty broad that gives thee best dome
And im blowin on some of the finest weed that's grown...homes
You won't know when they gon' dump a slug
But you can tell im getting money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up, u can't compare the doe
And if its only one bitch don't even share a hoe

[Chorus: Ft. Nate Dogg]

If you my nigga you my nigga till the end whoa
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a benz my friend....whoa
Let's toast till we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky na na na
If you my nigga you my nigga till we go whoa
One of the few I would take a bullet fo my neegaaaro...whoa
Let's toast till we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky na na na

[After Chorus: Nate Dogg]

If you my nigga you my nigga till the end Whoaaaaaaaaa
My friennnnnnd Whoaaaaaaaa
Na na na

If you my nigga you my nigga till we go Whoaaaaaaaaa
My nee-ga-row Whoaaaaaaaaa
Na na na
