[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks] 
Ey, Excuse Me Miss You Must Be Some Kind Of A Model 
Enough To Make A Shopper Run Out Of The Carlo 
Enough To Make A Weak Nigga Go Mano Y Mano 
Guess What I'm Strong As Rum Outta The Bottle 
God Bless You When He Made Me 
I Mean He Blessed Me When He Made You 
I Got A Little Game Too 
They Know Me Everywhere I Go 
Thats What Fame Do 
But We Can Keep It On The Low 
Whats Your Name Boo 
You Stuck In Your Ways But I Know How To Change You Range You 
Tell You Things Like You're My Angel 
Theres No Rules When It Come To This 
Write Down Your Number Miss 
They Call Me Banks 
My Goverment Is Chris 
They Feel Me In The Burbs 
Love Me In The Bricks 
Four Inch Lips On A Buggy Six 
First Class Trips And The Bubblies Crys 
I Work So Hard To Live Like This 

[Chorus: Keri Hilson] 
My Past Made Me So Weak But 
You Make Me Stronger 
Cause Everything Was Upside Down 
Now I'm Right Back Where I Belong 
Help I Think Cupid Got Me 
Shot Me All Over My Body 
I Think I'm Loosin My Cool 
Cause I'm Doin Things I Don't Do 

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks] 
Yeah I Got Her 
She Hopped In The Ride So I Can Holla 
My Favorite Girl Outside Of My Impala 
I Ain't Goin Sell You A Dream I Don't Gotta 
You Can Walk Around In The Street With No Colla 
I Pick Up All These ?? Speaks That Don't Bother 
The Innocent Role Aint Workin, Work Harder 
I Ain't Tryna Lock You Down, I'm No Father 
But Maybe We Can Go Further If You Just Listen 
It's Hard As Hell For A Man In My Position 
To Pick A Good Girl Up You Gotta Know The Difference 
I Wonder If There's Even One In Existence 
Enough To Keep My Attention To Go The Distance 
Now Imma Have To Look Hard To Find A Better One 
Cause You Sex Is A 187 Hun 
You Got A Nigga Doin Shit I Aint Neva Done 
So Now Even When I'm On Tour I Let Her Come 

[Chorus: Keri Hilson] 
My Past Made Me So Weak But 
You Make Me Stronger 
Cause Everything Was Upside Down 
Now I'm Right Back Where I Belong 
Help I Think Cupid Got Me 
Shot Me All Over My Body 
I Think I'm Loosin My Cool 
Cause I'm Doin Things I Don't Do 

[Female:] 
You Not Lot The Ones I'm Used To 
I See Us Happy In Our Future 
I'm Givin You All I Have 
My Heart My Soul My Back 
Cause You Are The Only Thing I Need 

[Lloyd Banks:] 
I Can Be Everything And More 
Give You The Feeling You Can't Ignore 

[Chorus: Keri Hilson] 
My Past Made Me So Weak But All Them Other Guys 
You Make Me Stronger Before You 
Cause Everything Was Upside Down Did Me Wrong 
Now I'm Right Back Where I Belong So Wrong 
Help I Think Cupid Got Me I Got You Now 
Shot Me All Over My Body 
I Think I'm Loosin My Cool 
Cause I'm Doin Things I Don't Do
