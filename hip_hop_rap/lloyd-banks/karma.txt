I am forewarn you tonite 
First time for everytime I try 
But I'm alright 
I may just swallow my pride 
N just put all the bullshit to the side 
If u ready to ride 
I'm down for a one night stand 
Gotta accept it any way that I can 
Cuz I ain't yo man 
I try for whatever it's worth 
Just remember who played who first 

I can't keep my eyes off ya 
I can tell why them other guys lost ya 
The kinds red an a flying saucer 
Thats what I can offer 
Simalarities and characters 
Havnt ya heard the word around town 
How I get down? 
They all whistle
Everybody part official
An that ass was you
Got my dick hard as a missle 
Dont hop on top
Cuz I ride around with a pistle 
N if they pull us over I'll be out of town wit an issue
If you was mine I'd introduce u to momma girl
Your styling your moves 'n your nirvana 
I'm so used to ur prada
Taking trips to houston it's hotta 
Throwing that Al Green n using that impala 
Lay my jewels on my collar
Ya had me feeling like a fool when I holla'd
Trying to squeeze in but you wouldnt bother 
But I ain't either
Soon as I realize that I ain't either 
She in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager

Like I don't mean to bother you 
But your sex appeal is remarkable 
U make a G wanna walk around in a park with you
There aint no telling what kinda things that I'm a start to do
If i get wrapped up on your ass to fast 
I can tell u feel the same cuz when I ask you laugh
So im'a leave it at that n hint n put it in my math
I imagine your prolly twice as good in a bath
But I'm buggin 
Cuz I can see u right in the hood when I pass
Im never stapled cuz business is on my ass 
But you can be the one I visit before I dash
An I admit I been the type to hit n split 
But u can blame me for the females that I been getting with
Cuz most of these broads have there eyes on my grits
Till they're in deeper shit n they learn how to be satisfied with the dick an' 
N if you aint worth it then thats all u get 
I aint gonna blame you I'm gonna blame them tricks 
Cuz

U seem like your attitude 
Only appears when im mad at you 
In several situations n that includes 
When im gone to long ridin' thru them avenues
As soon as I get home this room is a scattered boos
U know my fantasies and my feeling things at camera speed
N ur girlfriends trying to sandwich me 
My hearts colder then ya sandwich meat 
Cuz Ii come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast but at a switch pace 
N i pop in a listerine strip before u get all up on a bitch face
Moving your body like this
Gonna make me blow like a bottle of cris 
I dont know noone hotter then twis
You got my temperature risin' from your
hips to ur thighs an
That glare in your eyes that brighten up her horizon
It comes naturally I don't bribe em 
It's easy as... 1,2,3 n I slide em
