I'm So Fly
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy 
I'm So High
An I'm on point and I can tell that you jealous by the look in your eye 
When I Ride By
An I don't care
G-Units goin straight to the top this year
Nigga Im So Fly
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy 

Banks is fresh out the gutta gutta 
To smooth to stutta stutta 
His cig will melt a riva like 2 scoups of butta butta
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burna cuz she ain't concerned cuz he's a earna
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murda
Fight wake up n' fuck like Ike n' Tina Turner
It's a privilege to ride with a celeb 
Cause them girls over three don't got a problem given head
Paranoia is on ya that's why your mama is in your bed
Fuck a rare chinchilla and bossin mama for ya head
And where the block im from niggas be damn near 40 and still tuckin'
And niggas baby mama is pregnant and still fuckin'
It's eithier cause their boyfriend is a scrub like brillow
Or cuz banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown 
For my niggas that got locked up 
And deported and now they gotta go back home

I'm So Fly
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy 
I'm So High
An I'm on point and I can tell that you jealous by the look in your eye

Don't confuse me with these suckas 
Cause when I spit you hear more ouus then a skip to my lil move at the rucka 
Thank god for given Banks the gift 
You think that bandana makes you look gangsta but all I see is a handkerchief 
Nigga there's no one out the click that freeze us
Believe that 'cause I ain't scared of shit but jesus
Look dawg I don't roam with the poodles 
Difference is I'm eating in Rome and you eatin roman noodles
Ya boys corrupt kid
Banks will send a bitch to the store just for a piece of cheesecake like puff did
You jokes cant afford these homes
Look around I got 40 clones now look down that's 40 stones
And that's only in the necklace
I'm bony and I'm reckless vroom there's Tony in a Lexus
Im fresh out the gutta scrap whatcha man thought
Im in the hood with more straps than a Jan Sport

I'm So Fly
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy 
I'm So High

When I travel I know I'm gonna get stuck 
Cause they harass us in the airport like I'm the ones that's blowin shit up
I got the patience of a high school teacher 
And a bright future why the fuck would I have a bomb on my sneaker
Will the goody girls back of us
My hearts colder than jack frost is
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes and my black forces
A black rose for a rats coffin'
Blowin O's in that black coffin'
Blowin the road and I'm back flossin' 
No one knows how much that's costin 
Fuck ass only the green moves me 
I got a clean Uzi A pair of gloves and a mask from the scream movie
So if your plottin' on poppin' off sceem smoothly
Or get a little red spatter on ya cream coogy
My name ring each state
So you ain't gotta go all the way to LA to get ur mc eight

I'm So Fly
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy 
I'm So High
An I'm on point and I can tell that you jealous by the look in your eye
