[Intro]
Uh..
Yeah..
I like the way you do that shorty shorty
Now can you do somethin' for me uh
I like the way you movin' girl
Show me how you do that girl
I like the way you do that shorty uh
Now can you do somethin' for me

[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low!

[Verse]
Yeah..
I'm in the 2006, brand new wagon
Lookin' for a diva to handle a dragon
And even if there's two of um, i'ma move in and bag um
Make sure i'm strapped, keep the Uz and the Magnum
Yeah the gun talk, but i'm talkin' 'bout the condom
They followin' me home with my dog right behind um
Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion
Another bad bitch half black and italian
I dont know if she likes me or my medallion
You think i give a fuck, i'm just tryna get a nut
I dont need no-one to build my self-esteem up
Im fresh out the hood, but fuck it its all good
Why you can use me, cuz i'ma use you
For menage-a-twage, you know the usual
And if you do me maybe i'll do you
A favour and walk you outside, rightt

[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low!

[Verse]
Naa, i aint ever aite pussy before
But im close to the edge if she pushin' me Lord
Her body language is that a nigga stiff as a sword
So she cant be a angel this bitch is a fraud
Head prolly took a nigga on a trip to the morgue
Pussy good enough to drive out the Michigan Ford
As soon as i hit the door she's squeezin' my arm
Hoppin' all on a nigga like Christina Milian
It might take a couple rounds to make me get to calm
But when she does go to sleep she might need a alarm
Cuz i'm gone, she wanna be with a don
But i'm stuck so i'ma keep it about me on a song
Aint nothin' wrong, with a lil' bumpin' and grindin'
Especially if they got somethin' behind um
Im high as hell, pussy drunk when i climb in
How a nigga unfortunate i'm in

[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low!

[Verse]
Shorty looks like she's datin' a fashion designer
Damn, she musta got that from her momma
You know me somewhere in the back with the Llama
Keeps one of the cats with the drama, i'ma
Get a lil' closer to her, ma look so sweet
She remind me of a lot of broads aint Monique
But a bird nigga tryna holla, they all speak
Do you write up her phone number down, they wont keep
Lemme get her, i have her burnin' Haze all week
Givin' me wop to the music, mine plays on beat
Yeah, i'm so street, i'm so cheap
I'm so fly, but you already know that i
Dunn been all around the world, they dont know that guy
But lil' man gon' talk to, i oppose that i
He just mad that he aint got the kinda clothes i buy
All ride in the U.F.O i drive

[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low! low, low, [echoes]
