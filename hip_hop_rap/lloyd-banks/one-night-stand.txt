[Lloyd Banks Singer Intro]
Uh... Oooooohhh
Uh huh... Ooohh
Yeah...

[Singer]
I'm one night standin'
My joy ride has just begun
Girl i'm the one that can get the job done
And not fall victim to the hit and run
I'm one night standin'
No breakfast in bed today
Soon as day break i be on my way
MIA back to JFK

[Lloyd Banks Verse]
Yeah..
Shorty damn near mine without the whip and chain
bet if i don't get the ass, i'ma get the brain
whether she knows or don't know what the scriptures sayin'
i'm a player with a league pass, ma i get the games
whether i hit her don't hit she won't forget the name Banks!
Lloyd Banks you know the yellow nigga with the change
a frozen hand on the metal when i whip the Range
i'm sittin' sideways, dazed and switchin' lanes
theres a 60-inch plasma in the master room
and we can sleep the whole mornin and fuck the way to afternoon
i had a way with words since i had a half a moon
and i'm tourin' the world all winter, i'll be back in June
you ain't gotta handle a mop, or push back a broom
theres Mays Fat, this where the paper with the papers at
scars are a part of my story i can't take it back
maybe thats why i look at shit like that.. Yeah!

I'm one night standin'
My joy ride has just begun
Girl i'm the one that can get the job done
And not fall victim to the hit and run
I'm one night standin'
No breakfast in bed today
Soon as they ring shots i be on my way
MIA back to JFK

[Lloyd Banks Verse]
Uh..
And its the same thing around the way
just a lot more drama, you have to swing around the K
i never got the ones i wanted just the ones that wanted me
look at her, she got the vapours cuz i'm on TV
lookin' like a million dollars in that blue GT
and my Reeze and my blue EV's, bitch please
i have you feelin' like you hit the jackpot
cuz my backshots, equivalent to crack rock
i have you hooked off, dick prank callin'your bitch
going back and forth with your friends paintallin' my whip
besides i done gave you the sign, you just wouldn't read it
now you feelin' like Keyshia Cole and You Should've Cheated
so fucked up, i pay it to never mind
mind on my money, money keep shit together, i'm
probably goin' where you drove and lookin'
listenin' to the radio and half way out of Brooklyn, good lookin'

[Singer]
I'm one night standin'
My joy ride has just begun
Girl i'm the one that can get the job done

MIA back to JFK
