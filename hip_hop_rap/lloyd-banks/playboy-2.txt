[Lloyd Banks Intro]
Whooooooooooooo.....

[Chorus]
Uh..
Two figures up yup, Henny in my cup yup
Semi in the cut yup, a very nice truck yup
i'm all might stuck yup, pocket full of ?? yup
i knock your wife up yup, man i don't give a fuck, nah
The Unit's in this bitch, you know who i'm with
rollin' out the piff, six after six
hangin' out the whips rocks bangin' off my wris'
i'ma ball till i die, why, cuz i'm a Play B-O-Y

[Verse]
Guess who's the man this quarter, the rich playin' the boarder
your papers much shorter, my safe is this big
not from New York to Georgia, they recognise the slaughter
diamonds around the boarder, a platinum icepick
we in them Lambs the colour of Candy Yams
the only niggaz in the city with Miami tints
i picked up my advance and took off out to France
thousand dollar pants and hundred thousand dollar hands
mami i don't dance, i rock, i bop
i half a ounce of ?? in my sock, i'm hot
if i like it i'ma cop it on the spot, why not
these haters still won't give me my props, i'm shot
i do it for the concrete, the curb, the block
all i got is the street, my word, my cock
these little niggaz emulatin' me know why
know why, know why, cuz i'm a Play B-O-Y

[Chorus]
Uh..
Two figures up yup, Henny in my cup yup
Semi in the cut yup, a very nice truck yup
i'm all might stuck yup, pocket full of ?? yup
i knock your wife up yup, man i don't give a fuck, nah
The Unit's in this bitch, you know who i'm with
rollin' out the piff, six after six
hangin' out the whips rocks bangin' off my wris'
i'ma ball till i die, why, cuz i'm a Play B-O-Y

[Verse]
Hey..
Pull up in a Benz, hoodie and my Timbs
hologram rims, a lotta Benjamins
i shop till i drop, i stunt when i want
rollin' blunt after blunt blowin' bump out the trunk
now i can take a shit on all of y'all, dump after dump
i'm high when i'm drunk, havin' lunch at the trunk
don't front, and get to rockin', and my cliqe is poppin'
now my hits is droppin thats why the chickens flockin'
i ain't a come up, i got the Louis black
Hydraulics on the 'Lac, i pop and whooly that
now we got enough toys to knock the city back
beef and broccli fitted cap, he's the rockiest in rap
they copyin' my moves i cruise on twenty-two's
big pools, money and jewels, that's all i never lose
the illest never one at a time, just by the two's
and ooohhh, you should see what my song make 'um do, uh

[Chorus]
Uh..
Two figures up yup, Henny in my cup yup
Semi in the cut yup, a very nice truck yup
i'm all might stuck yup, pocket full of ?? yup
i knock your wife up yup, man i don't give a fuck, nah
The Unit's in this bitch, you know who i'm with
rollin' out the piff, six after six
hangin' out the whips rocks bangin' off my wris'
i'ma ball till i die, why, cuz i'm a Play B-O-Y
