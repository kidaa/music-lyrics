[Verse Banks]
Rap gone get that boy found in a river
Dead by a trigga thinkin he Swartzanigga
Foolz dont take him i took him across the liver
Keep lloyd line on my stomach from the sizzla
The drama is a part of the story that ima give ya
The black mags and backstabs are so familiar
The knapsacks and blackbags are full of scrilla
That lame aint a killa he softer than chinchilla
And ima gt see a 4 door wheela
Matta fact this summer its 44 4 wheelers
45 on my side shorty ride for his pride
Fourty eyes on the prize now im energized
Nothin but shiny shit around the neck n rimz
Bitches only come around when ya gettin record spinz
What a way to double up im headin on my second wind
Rollin luggage on the jet i aint gotta check it in

[50 Verse]
This is heroin medicine that morphine flow
My gun go off nigga and everybody know
I hold it down with the pound 3n57 ways
Hollow tip graze ell put a part through ya waves
Half christian half killa half man half gorilla
I pop sumthin do a nigga dirty for that scrilla
Now im floored d's kick the door
Found me on the floor by my toilet tryna flush that raw
Toilet wouldnt flush im fucked
Half a brick of yay goin round and round
Mary j my life im goin down

[Prodigy Verse]
You about to get that ass caught up in some shit
We about to show that ass how it get
When the jealousy turn envy n the shit
Turn deadly the innocent gets hit
Pull up in them whips
Tinted out spittin out
Hollows and they rip 
Niggas apart in the dark
Or its day time its good with me
Just cool i brought the whole hood with me
We had a gabriel right before MTV
So we can g him to give us that chain for cheap
We got david and jacob for them bracelets and rings
Cause our verse in the hood makes their names ring
She take a picture with me on Bet
She the new talk of the hood its PCP
One taste of the stick she hooked like fish
Me banks and hav got this shit vice gripped
