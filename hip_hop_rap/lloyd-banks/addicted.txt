I think i gotta have it
Its keeps pullin me in like a magnet
Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block
Its like crack to an addict
It aint to hard for me to grab it
Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block

Uh man i think im addicted to the life that i had
So i risk it runnin the street with the heat boy
Three deep in the suv the bigger u blow the less you see
The more u hear a real nigga lost his life right there
Its hard to believe a flippers the reason he's not here
Damn and still get killed over somethin that aint his
And jeapordize the well bein of him and his kids
Thats how it is cigs in old cribs dudes that tote pigs
Live with broke ribs or went under the dirt with the worms
The results of the colds pack funeral homes
U know the names cause we tatooin em on
Im gone just cruisin back 2 in the mornin
So fuck rap im comin at you in the song
When you hear the click clack point it at you n your gone

Ey i got my pockets right my rocks are bright
The drop is blue n the watch is white
Right thats why they watchin me
As far as i can see its all mockery
And im tryna be all i can be
Now that my foots in the door theres no stoppin me
Pure poetry i got a little pac in me
Now internationally they jockin me
Cause my money green n blue like monopoly
Yea i left a name all around the globe
Yet still southside i was brought up by the code southside
N i was told everything aint gold its cause the glitter
And had to drown the pain with the liquer
The world dont turn unless the money move
The early bird get the worm and the dummys lose
True u hear the struggle and the grind when i talk
I breathe and i bleed new york
