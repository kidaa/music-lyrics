[Lloyd Banks Intro]
Uh...
G-Yeah...
I'm back...

[Chorus]
I'm a G-Unit nigga that means i don't play by the rules
But i can make you move
About a quarter mill on juice so i ride around with the Ooohs
Now that'll make um move
Ma, you should stay in or come to me make up your mind
I lashed out too fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mine
Cuz i ain't leavin' the club without my dimeee
You know i got my nineee
Think twice before you cross that lineee
Nigga you must have lost your minddd
Thinkin' you can get off my shinesss

[Verse]
Shorty got to shakin' and i'm waitin' to take her home
it's hot as hell in here and i'm bakin' up a Patrone
i know a couple different ways i can make 'um bone
and when i'm done with her, she'll wanna take a nigga to Rome
give me a hour i have her blowin' up my phone
like a stem to a stone she won't leave me alone
million dollar nigga i get it and show off
but Doja, give ma minute with your boss, i'll fold ya
New York fitted and gold cross in a Rover
holster, all over the shoulder
i'm the sickest thing spittin' in NY
your plane ain't the same, it's different when i fly
Southside player play around and get shot
twenty four hours steak out on your block
don't get your views confused with Hip-Hop
'fore you wind up on the news, now watch the hit drop..

[Chorus]
I'm a G-Unit nigga that means i don't play by the rules
But i can make you move
About a quarter mill on juice so i ride around with the Ooohs
Now that'll make um move
Ma, you should stay in or come to me make up your mind
I lashed out too fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mine
Cuz i ain't leavin' the club without my dimeee
You know i got my nineee
Think twice before you cross that lineee
Nigga you must have lost your minddd
Thinkin' you can get off my shinesss

[Verse]
Yeah..
From what i hear niggaz don't like me
it's funny, they wanna be jus' like me
you bummy, it's jealousy more than likely
the money, they made a nigga all icey
four finger ring that boy doin' his thing
VVS Bling my chain long as a swing
boulevard king over known in Beijing
fully prepared for whatever the drama may bring
sixty-nine scraper with the up and down pumps
murder is forever don't fuck around once
bottle after bottle i down 'um till i'm drunk
if you ain't chipped in don't come around my blunt
grimey and gritty New York City's top gun
first nigga act up gets a hot one
BPV the bottom and top done
i get there, i gets it, i'm done, one..

[Chorus]
I'm a G-Unit nigga that means i don't play by the rules
But i can make you move
About a quarter mill on juice so i ride around with the Ooohs
Now that'll make um move
Ma, you should stay in or come to me make up your mind
I lashed out too fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mine
Cuz i ain't leavin' the club without my dimeee
You know i got my nineee
Think twice before you cross that lineee
Nigga you must have lost your minddd
Thinkin' you can get off my shinesss

[Verse]
Yeah..
I don't know about you but i'm doin' it for the queue
whip brand new size twenty-two shoe
use your money don't let your money use you
i got a cruise view, you know the usual
my life's beautful, my pockets full of bread
you get outta pocket i play soccer with your head
and that girl ain't your girl know the difference boy
nigga i done killed more niggaz than a liquor store
i left somethin' on her when i seen her
and she was rubbin' it in, like Nakazeena
she will kill big niggaz, cute big hips
and she's pretty convincin', a video vixen
if you lookin' for a mack i fit the description
chicks see him take pictures and kiss him
back blockin' nigga i get it and i'm good
i'm hood, livin' life like you should..

[Chorus]
I'm a G-Unit nigga that means i don't play by the rules
But i can make you move
About a quarter mill on juice so i ride around with the Ooohs
Now that'll make um move
Ma, you should stay in or come to me make up your mind
I lashed out too fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mine
Cuz i ain't leavin' the club without my dimeee
You know i got my nineee
Think twice before you cross that lineee
Nigga you must have lost your minddd
Thinkin' you can get off my shinesss

[Outro]
Grew up in the Y... New York that is...
Y-Y-Ya know the name...
I handle my biz... kid...
