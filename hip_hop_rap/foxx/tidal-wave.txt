Something's going wrong inside of you
Burdens bearing down and seeping through
Well, I don't want to bleed anymore for you
And I don't want to breathe any hatred too

Sitting while you world just floats around
Now you want to move 'cause it's crashing down
Well, I don't want to sing you guarantees
And I don't want to cling to our use to be's
So take your heart, take your soul
Just get yourself on out of here
Yeah, take your hurt, take your pain
Just get yourself on out of here

Wasting time
That's all you'll do if you're waiting for me
Wasting time
I don't see what you think I see
Wasting time
That's all you'll do if you're waiting for me
Wasting time
I don't want what you think I need
