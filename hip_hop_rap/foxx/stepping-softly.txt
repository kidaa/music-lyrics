Maurice White, Burt Bacharach   Philip Bailey

All my life I've been told
Men don't show much emotion
And they say
With love we play
Games that have no devotion

Now I'm the type to fall in love
Every morning
Stay right here
Girl, don't you fear
I'll never hurt you

For your love
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
Here's my heart
Wanna live my life with you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
Spend all my days and nights
Always lovin' you, so baby

Chorus:
Two hearts
Can't stop
Love's feelings
That's deeper every moment we're living
Can't stop this lovin' feeling

Every time I look at you
You remind me of heaven
Stars at night are in your light
I say that I'm crazy

For your love
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
Here's my heart
Wanna live my life with you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
Spend all my days and nights
Always lovin' you, so baby

Bridge:
When we're face to face
Love is a blessing
No one can control
No matter what they say
Love is a lesson
I won't let you go

Chorus:
Can't stop this lovin' feeling
Lady, don't stop
Do me the same way, baby
Start from the top
Lost in this lovin' feeling
Can't hide this lovin' feeling

Repeat
