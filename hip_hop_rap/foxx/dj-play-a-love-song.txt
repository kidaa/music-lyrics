[Spoken Jamie:]
I know you see me lookin' at you 
And I know he know you lookin' at me 
Well....damn 

[Chorus]
DJ won't you play this girl a love song 
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song 
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, I can tell that things ain't right on the home front 
What she really needs is a G like me to Beat a beat, beat it, beat it 

[Verse 1]
I can see how you want it baby 
Wish ya man wasn't here with ya baby 
I can see ha curiosity ha ha 
Gotcha wanna try me ha ha 
Homeboy can't please ya ha ha 
On this wall in the open baby 
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin' baby 
Ha Ha you want it

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
Baby, I got things that I wanna say 
Won't you meet me in the bathroom 
We can pull a freaky episode, I got my beretta if the nigga come through 
Baby, I know he ain't treatin' you right Lady, look at yo bad ass 
turn around ooh turn around ooh damn you fine ooh ooh ooh ooh 

[Chorus 2x]

[Twista]
Tell me why he did you wrong 
Need to get up with the Twista I been sippin' on Patron 
Stroke it when I hold them legs up 
He can take you out to dinner and look like a playa 
I'm a give it to you good up in the elevator 
He be actin' all soft when he get in them draws 
I'm a break you off and fuck you up against the wall 
Finna move up in that slot cuz I'm somethin' he not 
and he don't know what he got, I'm in the drop top 
To get the twat I got a knot, no more runnin' from the cops 
now I'm rollin' with Foxx because the block's hot 
But I'm always a G, cuz I come from the streets and I got heat for whoever thinkin' they want some 
No more fuckin' with them lames, now you rollin' with a thug, so tell that nigga to beat it, beat it 

[Chorus 2x]

DJ play this girl a song 
Turned her out, damn that clown, ain't been down 

DJ play this girl a song
