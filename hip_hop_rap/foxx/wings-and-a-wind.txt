You know the kind of girl spreads mystique
She'll plant a kiss upon your cheek - whoa
She's the one the rich boys like
She guards a slingshot from their sight
Now you may call it lack of competence
Here's my story and my defense
I watched her slowly and I watched her fast
I've got to make the moment last
At the dance, o-o
You take a chance, o yeah
At the dance o-o
A romance, o yeah
So there were seated face to face
The cat and mouse without the chase yeah
And she lifts her smile at me
I stabbed her with stupidity
So I took out a paper and wrote down my name
And she whispered it's all the same
And so I'm standing here looking dumb but
Ah she took to me, did that girl succumb
At the dance, o-o
You take a chance, o yeah
At the dance o-o
A romance, o yeah
Went home that night and I climbed the walls, yeah
Left my number for her call
O - but I tell you that they're all the same
Love you the first night - forget your name
O - what a shame
At the dance, o-o
You take a chance, o yeah
Tell you at the dance o-o
A romance succumb stabs you
At the dance o-o, o no
You take a chance, o yeah
Tell you at the dance, o-o
Give me at the dance
O - I live at the dance
That girl is driving me hell now
Now everywhere
At the dance, o-o, o no
You take a chance
I tried at the dance
I tried my waltz, o-o
I tried; I tried my waltz
At the dance o-o
Yeah.
