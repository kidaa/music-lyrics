What happened to the world we painted
The masterpiece of me and you
Our work of art has all but faded
Nothing's here except the blues

Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down
Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down

It was a stroke of genius
Yeah just as pretty as you please
But all that's left between us
Is hanging on what used to be

Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down
Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down

Looking at it from a distance
I still can't believe my eyes
It's sad to have to witness
What we made on all those nights
Crumbling down, tumbling down

Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down
Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down

Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down
Love's crumbling, love's tumbling down
