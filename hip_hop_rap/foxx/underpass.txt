Take him back Rachel
It's time to stop lying
When he looks at me he's dreaming of your eyes
Don't be hard Rachel
There is no denying
He wa never truly happy in my arms

Take him back, oh take him back Rachel

Ignore what people say and listen to your heart
Someone up there knows it is only your silly pride
Maybe that's the best thing that ever happened to you
Sail against the wind
Against the tide
Don't say it's not right
Take him back

Take him back Rachel
He is pining for you
Just a mention of your name
His heart flutters
Don't waste time Rachel
Sure you know too
That being with him is the only thing that matters
