Think once if you want a little bit of fun
Think twice if you think I could be the one
Three times get your game on ready to run
All depends on what you want
I could get you caught up in a spin
Think twice
Is it the real thing you're into
Turn your life back to front
All depends on what you want

Come in baby I'm freezin
Stay a while or just breeze in
Check one one time together
Two for love, real and forever
We're not children anymore no
Can't tell what you're in my life for
Decide before we take the ride
Free fall or a rollercoaster oh oh
Put in a box
Friend or lover or both
Choice A, Choice B Uno, dos

Think once if you want a little bit of fun
Think twice if you think I could be the one
Three times get your game on ready to run
All depends on what you want
I could get you caught up in a spin
Think twice
Is it the real thing you're into
Turn your life back to front
All depends on what you want

Listen up no strings attached dear
Not into pressure, come around here
Let's Play
What do you say
Life's a little game oh oh
And if you want to take it further
Hang out, get a little closer
That's cool, no rules
It's really up to me and you
We'll hang a tag on this
After our first kiss
We can play this any way we want to

Think once if you want a little bit of fun
Think twice if you think I could be the one
Three times get your game on ready to run
All depends on what you want
I could get you caught up in a spin
Think twice
Is it the real thing you're into
Turn your life back to front
All depends on what you want

Let's not take it to heart
If we take it too far
Let's explore
What it is we're looking for
I feel something in your eyes
Could you be him in disguise
Don't play him girls it isn't wise
So I won't if you tell me what you want

Think once if you want a little bit of fun
Think twice if you think I could be the one
Three times get your game on ready to run
All depends on what you want
I could get you caught up in a spin
Think twice
Is it the real thing you're into
Turn your life back to front
All depends on what you want

Think once if you want a little bit of fun
Think twice if you think I could be the one
Three times get your game on ready to run
All depends on what you want
I could get you caught up in a spin
Think twice
Is it the real thing you're into
Turn your life back to front
All depends on what you want
