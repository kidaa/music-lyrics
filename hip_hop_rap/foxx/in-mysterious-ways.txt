Down on the seabed
crushed by the wave
twisted for money
born I a slave
devil on my back
underneath my skin
laugh at affliction
knock but don't you fall in
fever in my hands

And for the first time
in my small world
I have touched on greater meaning
and for the first time
in my small world
I have given myself to learning

There was a freedom
hard to define
vain and outspoken
like no friend of mine
devil on my back
underneath my skin
laugh at affliction
knock but don't you fall in
fever in my hands

And for the first time
in my small world
I have touched on greater meaning
and for the first time
in my small world
I have given myself to learning

Sail on me sailor
from London to Cairo
drugged up like fisherman
and cast of our halo
devil on my back
underneath my skin
laugh at affliction
knock but don't you fall in
fever in my hands
