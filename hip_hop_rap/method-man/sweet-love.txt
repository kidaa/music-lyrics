feat. Cappadonna, Street Life

[Street Life]
Excuse me gorgeous..

Just maxin, lookin for hoes, y'know, relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine, midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb, that tranked her nerves, calm words
Massaged the mentals, made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous, brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned, Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in, take a spin, destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, "Street, you ever ride while you drive"
I looked puzzled, and said, "Nah baby why"
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what

[Cappadonna]
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, "Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan"
I said, "Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub"
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love

[Method Man]
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast  She said, "I like it when it last"
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much
"Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts"
