[Method Man]
I'm the bastard the total package like Lex Luger
Pull a sting like a yellow jacket makin manuevers
through the slums nigga Iron Lung ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to my torture chamber pen and pendulum
Foul play year T2000 be judgement day
Face millenium hell to pay
My knuckles soft from the star wars of han solo
South paw ring your bell like its quasimodo what is the law
Stay hardcore my clan logo move to quik to catch a photo
Jettin on land like jet moto now we lord on the conduit
These niggaz actin like they been through it
As if the hardcore to the truest 
I Can't Lose like Parker Lewis
Set in my ways..
got you corny niggaz askin who is .. JOHNNY BLAZE
Get a late pass stinkin ass sucker ass
Now you sufferin like succotash 
while Johnny Cash is makin moves on your moneybags
im strict love stickin hundreds in your honeys ass
my verbal bucket in the background
holdin me down watching these clowns
as they eyeballin all day in the mind
Gettin high y'all
Put it on the skyfold the nite troll
Rap infected get the LYSOL to disinfect it
You don't know me or my fuckin Method
That's the shit that made me tip
when I wrote a pitch how many leech it
Stapleton, the Wild West Park Hill
Now Borne jungle nils one more game hit me with
that shit they be smokin..
got cali niggaz loc'in new york niggaz open
John Hay phenomenon the megabomb
Transformed in a firearm like Megatron
Youget stepped on and shit upon, I'ma stay calm
knowin brothers wanna do me harm
Shaolin whylen what .. punks
