feat. Street Life, Raekwon, Masta Killa

[Method Man:] Uh
[Masta Killa:] Deadly Melody part two

[Method Man]
Thats my word
It aint safe no more...no more bitch

[Masta Killa]
Yo yo
Brain is punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Moving with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
 the head in, not sure of this verse
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine, 
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions
Observe the magnetic attraction

[Method Man]
And its time for some grid...

[Street Life]
...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O
Plus like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo,
Stole-a-mite, crash your wind pipe, with the right to right
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights

[Method Man]
Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like
Splergin, dirty to the grain, no detergant
Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, its curtains

[Chorus:]
It aint nothing like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most D.J.'s won't refuse it
Alot of sucka M.C.'s misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain you'll abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is completely captured bass

[Inspektah Deck]
Yo
I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlov, 9 Glocks
Technique your rhyme part machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckle the foe, intro to outro
Galico, throw verse, we slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk
>From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede
>From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, had a gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust

[Killa Sin]
We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagent,  drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphie 
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous
Criminal minded killas rust
I intend to build a fortifying man,
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick

[Raekwon]
Aiyyo fluid rap bend, through a black Veluga black act
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical, mathematical
Slide up in your worth casual
Night air dog, who wear it all, blouse down to bra
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network beserk, mad hurting
Killing whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomindales
, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck yall niggas carve my ice through my beige window

[door creaking open]
[gunshots followed by a car alarm]

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Spazz Spazzola Ola
S-I-N-Y 10304
Lock your door
Crack your jaws
Drop your draws
It's all day everyday with this rap souflee'
Muzak...
