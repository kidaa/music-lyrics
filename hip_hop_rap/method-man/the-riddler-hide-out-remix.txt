[Intro:]

Yo...
Who's afraid, of the big, bad, BAT
Who issss, the Batman kid
It's me heh I ain't afraid of NUTTIN
Word up, let's do it of NUTTIN

[Verse One:]

I got your mind twisted twisted
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crossword puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health yeah it's like a maze within itself
yeah Check the grimey, slimey, crimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy
My rhyme committee, robbing every Gotham piggy bank blinnnnnnnd
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler

[Chorus:]

Tax free money not a problem
A heist to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
Hmmmmmmm.... it's The Riddler

[Verse Two:]

Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-it, QUIZZZ
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invading brothers wigs
Can I live
Corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddles
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler

[Chorus:]

Murder for the evil not a problem
To the gen there is no sequel not a problem not a problem
Big up to all my people not a problem not a problem
Hmmmmmmm... it's the Riddler

[Verse Three:]

Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill of the hill
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil bout a millll
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels Bobby Steels
We was blazing hardware hardware
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeel [rehrrarrrr]
On that ass fast was the Batmobile Batmobile
I could tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
trying to escape, jiggy with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler

[Chorus:]

Talkin homicide, not a problem that's no problem
You want to talk genocide not a problem that's no problem
Now if you're speaking genocide not a problem that's no problem
Hmmmmmmm.... for The Riddler

[Verse Four:]

Johnny Blaze, I invest in crime cuz it pays
Mad scams, let me count the ways, a crime wave
I make a killing, on the first one to point his finger at the villian
Who be I, the priiimmmmmme
Suspect, crim-inim-inal intellect
Robbing banks HAH down to grand theft what we want
is it all, every seal on every door, every wallllll
Until the jig is called on The Riddler
