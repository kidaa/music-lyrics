[Jonell]
Yeah-huh, yeah-huh, yeahhhhh, yeahhhh, ohhhhhhh
I try and I try to stop the forces that go round in my head and I
thought you were the one to understand
You turned my darkness towards the light
But once again you touched my hopes to pain
My soul's the same, my tears start flitting in the rain
I'm fallin again.. fallin again..

Chorus 2X's
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Jonell]
If you don't understand where I'm comin from
then my heart is tellin me you're not the one
All the games you played and now you lied
You're not the one, for me no more so baby bye bye
Pack yo' bags and get to steppin
You got to let it go you need to stop trippin
I hope you don't think I'll let you back in
cause youse, a, fool

[Chorus]

[Jonell]
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain

To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day
To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day

Chorus 2X's

[Jonell]
Every-day, every round and around we go
To get away, away round and around we go
Hi-Tek round and around we go
Round and round, round and round round and around we go
We go round, and, round
We go in-side-out round and around we go
We go back, and, forth
We go round, and round round and around we go

Did you hear me?
