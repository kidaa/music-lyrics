Good news Hip-Hoppers
The big alert has been called off
It turns out that the early reports were wrong, ALL wrong
Now for that clan out there that had such a tough time gettin home
Sorry bout that!
I guess the only thing we can do, is play you a song

Yeah, do that, uh-huh uh uh, UH

Yes what what what, what what what, what
What what what, what what what, UH
Yea yea yea if you don't, lay back
Raider Ruckus you catch a lazy jack Carlton Fisk
Yaknahmean Huh, one.. two.. Shaolin What

Shoes full of dirt, kickin sand on your works
Something gotta hurt, catch a case off a verse
Live in concert, kids comin out they shirts
I'm hyped now, jumpin in the crowd feet first
Meant it when i said it, lungs Bring the Pain son
without the anesthetic, make em look pathetic
needin help from paramedic, Hot with the Nickle
Bust back, take em wit you
Survival of the Fittest, and the world out to get us
I feel it in my bones, I can feel it
in my testosterone, when it's on
Stat', bring it back, hard rap for you pussy-cat 
Cognac off the meat rack, where the pussy at 
Johnny, got these n*ggaz mad at they mommy
Jumping on my hard salami, say what you like
In the Heat of the Night, I crash individuals
Splash on the mic, air-tight with the lyrical

[Chorus: Method]

n*gga run with it, have fun with it
load your gun with it, and be done with it
Welcome to the Killin' Field, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie n*ggaz, goin thru changes

[Method Man]
It all starts with the pad and pen, my special blend 
of herbs and spices on mic divices, murder men
Make em mices, I recommend, somethin that's priceless 
For you rap hooligans, claimin you nicest
Call it what you like kid, you can even call
a psychic for all I care, still ain't got a prayer
amongst the righteous, Blazini, cheat death like Houdini
Word to bad bird that f*cked nerds in bikinis
Ob-serve, lyrical flows you being served from the gizzard 
Pluckin your nerves with nouns and verbs
From the ghettoes to the suburbs, I must be heard 
n*ggaz get what n*ggaz deserve
You can put that on my Clan logo, Wu-Tang group for solo
Bloody up my next promo 
With the blood of the next bozo, clown @ss n*ggaz be loco
Puffin on lye, cuckoo for cocoa

[Chorus]

Yo yo, sh*t be hot in the kettlepot, Twisted Metal
bust shots til the beef settle, forget me not
City nights get a n*gga hyped, scar his life
Send him back, now he Poltergeist, ghost!
Tell him, who the number one rap most, huh
Verbal overdose leave him comatose, huh 
The n*gga with the golden throat is out to get you, Hot Nickle
Bust back and take em wit you, eye for eye 
Never lie, crossin my heart, hopin you die 
Somebody pat the engineer down, I think he wired
I'm off the meat rack, quick to react, my n*ggaz need that 
They need gas, cockin heat back, be out like Freejack 
The heat's on, you think one-eight, and Johnny's blamed 
Who that n*gga, burn biscuit and spit flame
Leave no witness, in the fast lane with shady b*tches
that only want me for my riches, I know your steez
Terror Fabulous, caution, biohazardous degrees
from this ravenous, emcees be yappin
Meth be the co-captain, on Def Jams that's closed captioned 
for hearing impaired, they get a share, now what's happenin
Money to share, that's why we're here 
and you actin like we can't eat, like y'all eat
Now we scrappin, out in the street, I know your crew's 
hardheaded motherf*ckers and I'm just like you

[Chorus]

Welcome to the Killin' Field, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie n*ggaz, goin thru changes

[Method Man]
I been in the ghetto all my life
I swore to take that b*tch for better or for worse
YouknowhatI'msayin, that's for life n*gga, y'know
Til death do us part...
