Yo, c'mon!
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect I'll still be Meth
The jams will still be def
I'm here, me and this mic-phone, we here
And ain't tryin' to hear nothin' cuz we had it up to here
What
Lyrics have no dress code yeah
From KRS to Depeche Mode
Hit them so cool you cats cold
Had to jump off, it's about to jump off
My niggaz speak with they hands or the gun talk
Yo RZA, we got the Clan in the front and police at the door
Every exit is laced with C-4 about to blow
Life trial I'm passed out
MC's is like bitches in thongs - they assed out
But me, the M-E-T-H- the O-D
Just too real, I can't be touched and can't feel
The monotony in rap, take a picture of my nut sac
Carbon copy that and send your crew a fax
Motherfucker

[1 -  New and improved Wu-Tang style]
Turn it up now, y'all done fucked up now
Spit flames Five mics
Peep game On site
Bring the pain All night
Off the chain Damn right

[2 - Scratching by RZA]
"It's the Method Man for short Mister Meth"
"Tical-lion"
"Hmmm"

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect, through my first born, my name lives on
My words is like a third degree to young emcees
Buzzworthy on your MTV, the Killa Bees
John Jacob, straight up, break up, schemes and plots
Ace up my sleeve, bake up pies in pots
So this is what it's come to Huh
Lickin' shots at them kids that used to punk you Huh
Repetitious rap shit, don't get no air play ya mouth whip
And niggaz can't smoke wit' dry lips so chapped
Bite my shit, I'm like Kojack to get my flow back
In fo' flat, I track you down like a low jack
Spy verse spy, eye for an eye can I penalize the uncivilized
Make 'em civilized
You know right from wrong, so know I'm the bomb
Who don't beef for beats, see the tracks on my arm
Motherfucker
