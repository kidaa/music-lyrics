When this world
The real life world you're living in
Just gets too much for you to take
When you find
Too many troubles on your mind
And feel just like there's no escape

And it seems your heart's forgotten how to believe
Turn a page in your soul
There's a place you can go
Close your eyes and let your heart fly free

Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far as your heart can see
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need is just a dream away

Remember when
A dream could take you anywhere
Just a wish anything could be
When the farthest star was one more star you could reach
Take a look in your heart
'Cause that's where dreams are where it starts
Anything is real if you just believe

HOOK

All it takes is faith to make your dreams come true
And somewhere in this world there'll be somebody
To share your dreams with you
