Snoop Dogg: 
New American 
How ya love dat' 
Off the hizzle frashizzle dizzle 
Get it to me Baby fizzle 

chech it check it check it 

Girl you got your busines in the street 
Claimin' that your sh*t is weak 
Been six months since you've been gone 
How come you ain't called 
When you don't feel love no more 
You got no right to close the door 
You loved her once 
And she's got proof 
Baby boy looks just like you 

Chorus:
Yo' get her love and much respect 
Even if she's got man 
Ghetto Player you must understand 
That's you baby's momma 
Don't be late payin' your bills 
It takes two to make a kid 
When the hell you gon' understand 
That's you baby's momma 

Snoop's hook: 
Tell the baby goodbye baby goodbye 
'Cause you don't wanna be by wanna be by 
The way you acting....fly they way you acting....fly 
Girl you know you livin' a lie livin' a lie 

I heard you got a chick on the side 
I hope you got it right this time 
Heard she got inside your mind 
Hatin' on your family ties 
She's got no right to dawg her out 
That is the mother of your child 
You loved her once and that's the truth 
Baby boy looks just like you 

Chorus

Snoop Rapp: 
You say you don't love her 
You push her and you shove her 
That's your first son's mother 
Word to mother 
If it's that bad 
Then go and get another 
She kicked ya to the curb 
and now you're livin' in the gutta 
St-st-stutter
????
That child suppote support 
Is tearin' you butt up 
Nut up, cut up 
And act a fool 
Raisin' hell at the daycare school 
They threw you in jail 
For not payin' you dues 
You couldn't even buy yo son dem new coby? shoes 
Alotta fools say they do but they don't 
I know you're mad 
You got to hate boo 
Gon' wait it through 
Let's see what he gon' do 
He might, better yet better 
The court wrote a letter 
To be real wich you 
You gotta kid wich you 
So one to one 
Man to man 
He got to deal wich you 

How you gonna act when you sh*t is stong? 
When you don't even claim your own 
How can you even sleep 
When you know you're wrong 
Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
How you gonna act when you family's gone 
'Cause they tired of the sh*t you do all the sh*t you do 
How you gonna feel when you can't go home 
'Cause there ain't nobody there for you 

Chorus

Snoop's hook: 

That's your baby's momma uh
