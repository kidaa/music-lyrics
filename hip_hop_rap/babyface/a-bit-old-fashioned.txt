I believe that a woman
Is the most precious thing on earth
And I'll do anything
And I do mean anything
To stop my baby
From ever being hurt

Well it might seem kinda crazy to ya
Somewhat outta style

I'm just a bit old-fashioned
And I can't help
Livin' that way
I'm just a bit old-fashioned
And I can't help
Livin' that way

I'll go and work
My fingers to the bone
And I'll work overtime
So she can have a home
And I'll do anything
And I do mean anything
Don't want my baby
To hurt for a thing

Well that might sound kinda crazy to ya
Somewhat outta style

HOOK

Oh baby
That's the only way that I'll ever be
Forever dedicated to thee
One girl is all I ever will need
Loving you forever indeed
My whole damn life is you
And I would die for you
I might sound crazy
But the only thing important is you
I love you

HOOK
