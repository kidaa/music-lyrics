Called me up on a Friday night 
'Cause she knew you'd be out with ya girls 
Said she always thought that I was fly 
Me and her should maybe take a twirl 
I told her girl no no no 
But she still came knocking at my door 
I told her to go go home 
But that made her even want me more 
And now she's busy trying to signify 
That there was something going on between her and I 
Well that's the kinds sh*t that I won't dignify 
With an answer come on 

Chorus:
How can you be down 
She ain't down for you 
Don't be so naive she playin you 
Why is she around 
Girlfriend just ain't cool 
Tried to take your man 
Now she's takin you 
You need to say no no no 
Momma didn't raise no fool 
You need to let her know know know 
There'll be no more running games on you 

Dropped the crib early tuesday night 
'Cause she knew you'd be away at school 
Tried to seduce me with all kinda lies 
Tried to make me think the worst of you 
I told her girl no no no 
She dropped out and tried to give me a kiss 
I told her to go go home 
Then she said "you gon' be sorry for this" 
And now she's out there trying to testify 
That there is something going on between her and I 
That's the kinda sh*t that I won't let get by 
Don't she know that I'm grown 

Chorus

Somtime your friends 
Aint what they seem 
Want all your hopes and dreams 
And the will do just bout, sh*t, anything 
Whatever its gonna take to bring you oo down sea 
Give em' and inch they'll take a mile 
Knife in your back all with a smile 
Don't be surprised when they clean out your house 
Betta not bring no stray dogs home 

Chorus til fade
