You've gotta be
Outta your mind
You've gotta be
The best thing ever in my life
So why would i be
Taking a chance
Of losing the one most important thing
That I can call mine

When you know that I love you so much
And I never could love you enough
Girl the one thing I know I won't do
I won't break your heart
I love you

You much be trippin'
With an illusion
'Cause I don't sleep around
I don't sneak around
Girl stop your trippin'
With your illusions
Gotta stop now
'Cause I don't sneak around

Girl we should be
Having a time
We shouldn't be
Fighting each and every night
I don't understand
How you could feel
I've been untrue and so unfaithful
Girl you're making me ill

When you know that I've been there for you
Anything that you asked, I would do
In my heart of all hearts, I've been true
And I don't deserve this
Not from you

HOOK

Girl I think that I understand
But I'm not every other man
How can you blame me on what other have done
Can't you see this predicament
Doesn't make one bit of sense
Come back to earth
And you might come back to love

When you know that I've been there for you
Anything that you asked, I would do
In my heart of all hearts, I've been true
And I don't deserve this
Not from you
