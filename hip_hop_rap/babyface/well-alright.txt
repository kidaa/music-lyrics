In the twinkling of an eye
Girl you had me hypnotized
And I didn't care a thing about love
But I quickly start believin'
'Cause I found myself a reason in you
Yea I got a thang for you
And when I think
Think of the way I used to be
I was always all alone
Always doing something wrong
And when I think
Think of the change you brought to me
Girl I wonder why it took you so long

Well alright
Well OK baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life
Well alright
Well OK baby
I finally done me something right
I got you in my life

It was deep within my heart
Where the feelin' had to start
I had reason to believe it was love
And I'm sure that's what it was
'Cause I've never felt so much in me
Yea you brought love into me
And when I think
Think of they way things used to be
I was always much too cold
I was always all alone
And when I think baby
Think of the love you brought to me
I don't konw how I could've ever got along

[HOOK]

In this wake of happiness
I can't help but feel blessed
From you baby
'Cause of you girl
For the first time in my life
I know I've done it right
I fell in love with you

[HOOK]
