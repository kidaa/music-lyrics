[Verse 1]
You can take your Usher cd
i will take my luther with me
you can take ....
i let you take my undergrads
you can keep that ghetto chain
better leave that diamond ring
you might as well get used to no more wearing it
you can tell your friends things wont be like they was before
all your flossing all the shopping i was paying for
you can act like you aint sorry now but i no im gunna be missed, when it all comes down to this

[Chorus]
We're going outta business
shutting down the door
everything's on clearance, closin up the store
dont act like you dont hear it dont act like you dont know
we're going outta business everything must go

[Verse 2]
You better pay your cable bill
common girl lets be for real
your the one that had to have your Opera and your Dr. Phil
dont you touch that sofabed girl you know i payed for it
cant have you and him on it up there having sex
you can tell your friends why not why were not down no more
you can tell them it was not what i was wishing for
you can act like your not sorry no more
girl i know im gunna be missed when it all comes down to this

[Chorus]
We're going outta business
shutting down the door
everything's on clearance, closin up the store
dont act like you dont hear it dont act like you dont know
we're going outta business everything must go
We're goin outa business
counting down the days
sometimes no conditions
in the finally stake
dont act like you dont hear it
dont act like you dont know

You can take them stupid lies
put it were the sun dont shine
take them to the girlfriend hat will always sit inside your mind
and if you appologize to let me outa tide
wen it all comes down it all comes down to this

We're going outta business
shutting down the door
everything's on clearance, closin up the store
dont act like you dont hear it dont act like you dont know
we're going outta business everything must go
We're goin outa business
counting down the days
sometimes no conditions
in the finally stake
dont act like you dont hear it
dont act like you dont know
