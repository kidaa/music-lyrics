You're so in love
And that's nice
Just have fun
Living your life
He likes to kiss you
And that's cool
And that's the kind of thing that
Puppy lovers should do

But all your friends are saying
It's a matter of time
Before your Prince Charming
Hits you with the famous line
And all your friends are wondering
Just what you're gonna do
They say that if you do it
They'll have to trust you

But you don't want to do
The things they tell you to
It's not your personality
It's not the way you wanna be
And if he treasures you
Then he won't pressure you
Their faith is more than one thing
Left to decide

Take your time take your time
It's alright
You love your body
You wanna do right
Take your time
It's your life
Don't let nobody
Tell you that you're not right
Take your time take your time
It's alright
You love your body
You wanna do right
Take your time
It's your life
Don't let nobody
Tell you that you're not right

Your first time love
Hey that's cool
It's wonderful when love is innocent too
Like holding hands
And walking through the park
It's a special kind of love
What puppy lovers are

But all your friends are saying
That you're running out of time
They say that if you cherish him
You'll change your frame of mind
And all your friends are telling you
That if you're love is true
They say that you should do it
He'll forever cherish you

But you don't want to do
The things they tell you to
It's not your personality
It's not the way you wanna be
And if he treasures you
Then he won't pressure you
Their faith is more than one thing
Left to decide

[HOOK]

But you don't want to do
The things they tell you to
It's not your personality
It's not the way you wanna be
And if he treasures you
Then he won't pressure you
Their faith is more than one thing
Left to decide

[HOOK]
