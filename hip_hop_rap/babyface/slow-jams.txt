Sugar, sugar

Baby dim the lights
So while I pour the wine
Set the music up nice and slow
Wanna move with you inside a groove
Like no one's ever known
Let your body unwind in the warmth of mine
Tell me what you like
'Cause tonite I wanna turn you up to paradise

Sweet thang hold me close
Share my desire
And we can make the magic flow
Once the music is right

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
Baby get closer so we can feel the power of love
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let me lay my beat on you
We'll keep the music playing movin' in time

Let me get a taste of some Babyface
And you know it'll be alright
'Cause the road that ends at Boyz II Men
Is the road I wanna ride
We can go to the moon on a Stevie tune
Fly ribbons in the sky
Give me everything R. Kelly sings
Let us bump and grind

Baby feel the beat
Here in my heart
Move with me in ecstacy
Let the melody start

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me in that tender dance
I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Make tonight a dream come true
Let's keep this groove thing going and never never never let it stop

It's something that feels so right
Take this side of your rhythm

Baby tonight's your night
When I feel your beat inside my soul
It's a do me groove I know I can't control

Sweet thang hold me close
Share my desire
We can make the magic flow
Once the music is rockin'

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let me lay my beat on you
Let's keep this good thing going
Movin' in time with something good

REMIX:

SPOKEN:
Remix
I can't believe I'm here
Down at the Q's Jook Joint no doubt
It sure is happenin' y'all on this remix
But listening to this music
Kinda makes me think about when I used to listen to slow jams
Back in the day yeah
Like Babyface, Whip Appeal no doubt
Or R. Kelly, Bump And Grind
But you know what what?
Sometimes when I'm just layin' down with my man yeah
I get the feelin' I need to hear a little Barry White no doubt
Show you right show you right
Then there are other times when I just need a little Sexual Healing
Of Marvin Gaye it's the now, baby
Remix
What about some Teddy Pendergrass? no doubt
Close the door and turn out the lights remix

Feels so good baby, yeah
Yes ah
Yeah baby
Remix Baby Slow Jams, remix
Baby, oh yeah
Babyface

Baby dim the lights
So while I pour the wine
Set the music up nice and slow
Wanna move with you inside a groove
Like no one's ever known
Let your body unwind and walk the mile
Tell me what you like
'Cause tonite I wanna turn you up to paradise

Sweet thang hold me close
Share my desire
And we can make the magic flow
Once the music is rocking

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
Baby get closer so we can feel the power of love
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let me lay my beat on you
We'll keep the music playing movin' in time

Let me get a taste of some Babyface
And you know it'll be alright
'Cause the road that ends at Boyz II Men
Is the road I wanna ride
We can go to the moon on a Stevie tune

Move with me in ecstacy
Let the melody start

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me in that tender dance
