[Babyfacewhispers] 
Something about her, ya know 
Just way she carries herself, she's just so bad 
Ummmm..I don't know 

[verse 1] 
Her style 
Her mind 
Compares 
To nothing on this earth 
She's not 
The kind 
To share 
But God knows what she's worth 

[Bridge] 
I got to show her that I want her 
I recognize that she is bad 
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy 
Spending all my time just chasin 
repeat1x 

[Chorus] 
Her eyes, her smile, her skin, her smell, her hair 
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savwafair 
There she goes 

[Verse 2] 
I hope 
To find 
Her there 
Gotta make some eye contact 
she's 
The type 
To stare 
Move quick or lose her fast 

[Bridge 2x] 
[Chorus 2x] 

[Hook] 

Spending all my time watching that girl go 
And I love the way she moves 

[chorus 3x] 

[Hook]
