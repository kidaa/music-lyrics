[Verse 1]
First time i saw her it was heaven
prettiest thing i'd ever seen
i knew from that moment she was the only girl, i love her
that's when she gave her heart to me

[Chorus]
She belongs to you and me
She's the angel in our dreams
Thank you lucky stars, she fell in love with me
Were not for her, you and i would never be

[Verse 2]
Sometime in december was the day ou were conceived
We were as close as close could be
Now you cant remember but the day hat you were born
you were even closer then me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
God only knows how much she loves you
Well i've just as much as she, yes i do
Boy i only hope when you grow up you'll find a woman
That will love you like your mother has loved me

[Chorus 2x]
