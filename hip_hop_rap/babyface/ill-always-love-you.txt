I can't imagine living one day without you
I'd rather just lay down and just die
'Cause all I care about is what I mean to you
Sweet baby just knowing you is heaven
I'll always want you in my life

I can't explain, I can't explain the way I feel
You are the rhythm of my heart
And every beat you give is just how I make do
Swear girly nothing else could matter
Just stay here in my heart

And I'll always love you
Deep in my heart
Always love you, always love you
And I'll always love you
Deep in my heart
Always love you, always love you

There's not a feeling in this world that can describe
All of the joy you bring to me
I can't believe you found a way to maximize
All the love you give and do commit
Stay here in my life

HOOK

And only everything you heart could desire
Is all that I want for you
That's all I desire
And everything and anything you wanna give
Say the word my darlin' and I'm there to commit
You can think it, you can dream it
And I'll make sure you receive it

HOOK

I can't explain, I can't explain the way I feel
You are the rhythm of my heart
And every beat you give is just how I make do
Swear girly nothing else could matter
Just stay here in my heart
