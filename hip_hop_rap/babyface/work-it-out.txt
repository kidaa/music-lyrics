Said its a long nights? 
No rest for the weary 
Your baby keep cryin' 
He just won't go to bed 
Feels like you gon' die 
You know you gotta get up early 
There's not enough time for love 
cause if you cant get what you want 

Chorus
Well I'ma work it out work it out work it out work it out 
So we can think it out think it out think it out 
Well I'ma work it out work it out work it out work it out 
There ain't no...?...I'm working it ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

The rent is fast too 
Your not gonna make it 
the telephone haunts you 
You just cant pay the bills you just cant pay the bills 
Your car is broke down 
And the babys gotta go to school 
Your feelin left out 
Like nobody's gonna care for you care for you baby 
Well I gotta go crib girl 
A room for your kid girl 
So just put your mind at ease 
'Cause I've got the cash girl 
To pay down your rent girl 
So you can spend time with 
Spend some time with me 

Chorus 2 

Rap break 

Sugar sugar sugar sugar 

Chorus

I've gotta a crib baby 
A room for you kid baby 
I pay the rent baby
