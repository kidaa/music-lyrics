don't take it...take it so...baby 

I was wrong I was out of line 
I didnt' meant to lead you one 
But there was something in your eyes 
Your look so fly 
Reminds me of my girl back home 
Had it been another time 
I surely wouldn't 
If you and I were gettin it on 
But see I got me a girl 
And She's my world 
Thought you should know 

Chorus:
Don't take it so personalpersonal babe 
Don't you know there's nothing wrong with you 
Nothing wrong with me 
Its just the way it be 
Don't take it so personal 
Ain't got nothin to do with you 
Sometimes you win or lose 
Get chose or chooose 
There's really nothing you can do 

Its alright 
Don't apologize 
You didn't mean to turn me on 
There was something bout that night' 
That felt so right 
Even I was bout to lose control 
I could think of you 
No lie its true 
I knew I had to stop myself 
'Cause I got me a girl 
And she's my world 
I thought you should know 

Chorus

You could've been my girl 
I could've been with you 
You could have been my baby too 
I could've been your man 
You could've been my boo 
I could be makin love to you 
I coulda been your sweetheart 
Always down for you 
Spending all my time with you spending all my time 
But see I got me a girl 
And she's my world 
And I just want to say to you 

Chorus

Don't take it so 
Don't take it so personal Baby 

Don't take it so 
Don't take it so personal
