I ran into a friend of yours the other day 
And I asked her how u been 
She said my girl is fine 
Just bought a house got a job a real good man 
I told her I was glad for you 
that's wonderful 
but does she ever ask about me 
She said she's happy with her life right now 
Let her go let her be 
And I told myself I would 
But something in my heart just would not let you go 
I just want to know 

What if we were wrong about each other 
What if you were really meant for me 
What if we were suppose to be together 
Would that not mean anything 
What if that was suppose to be my house that u go home to every day 
How can u be sure that things are better 
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me 
Still wanting me 

Your friend asked me if they're were someone special in my life that I was seeing 
I told her there was no one in particular 
There's just I myself and me 
I told her that I dream of you quite often 
She just cut her eyes at me 
She said you got on ur very happy 
So just stop ur med lowing 
I told her that I won't 
I said that things were cool 
But I guess I was wrong 
I still can't move on 

chorus

Now that can be my car that can be my house 
That can be my baby boy that you're nursing 
That can be the trash, which I always take out 
That could be the chair that I love to chill in 
That could be my food on the table at the end of the day 
Hugs and the kisses all the love we made 
What the hell do u expect me to say 
What if it was really suppose to be this way 
What if you were really suppose to be with me 

Chorus
