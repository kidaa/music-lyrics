You're not alone, no
And no one's gonna hurt your heart again
And this I know, yes
You can count on me, I'll be there as your friend
For no one knows the pain that you've endured
They took the best from you
Girl, I know
You gave 'em all ya got

You tried, they played around
You cried, they let you down
You gave 'em everything you had
They treated you oh so bad

Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'd teach this world a lesson
And I'd never let you fall
Given a chance

It's not yuor fault
That you were born with such a trusting heart
Erase that thought
You're so beautiful, please stay the way you are
And no one understands how much it hurts
You tried to make it work
Girl I know
You gave it all you got

Don't cry, it's over now
Don't sigh, things are better now
I will give you everything you need
You can always count on me

Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'd teach this world a lesson
And I'd n-n-n-n-never let you fall

Don't cry, it's over now
Don't sigh, things are better now
I will give you everything you need
You can always count on me

Given a chance
I'd make it up to you
Given a chance
I'd prove this world was wrong
Given a chance
I'd give my all to you
I'm gonna teach this world a lesson
And I'm n-n-n-n-never gonna let you fall
