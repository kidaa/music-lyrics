[Verse 1]
It's not about who's right or who's wrong
It's not about who's weaker or who's strong
It's not about who's innocent or who's fault
It aint really bout that kinda thing at all
It's not about who does it or done it or did it to who
Dont matter if the both of you lose
It's really not bout nothing excpet for me and you girl

[Chorus]
It's about drama and love and 'lationships
and when the going gets tough you deal with it
and you dont ever you never walk away from it
you hold on you be strong
It's about drama and trust and making it
if your somebody messed up you dig it in
dont let nobody come between you you just stay with it
you hold on and be strong
and hold on, yes you do

[Verse 2]
It's not about the stupid things that we say
Were always saying stupid things anyway
It's not about the secrecy of the lines
Girl everybodys gots a secret to hide
It's not about who was it who was she who's creeping on who
Wont matter if the both of us lose
It's really not bout nothing, cept for me and you

[Chorus]

Aint bout your pride
Aint bout yourself
It's bout you do it to and noone else
Aint bout the her
Aint bout the lies
Aint bout the crazy things thats running through your mind
It's bout the love thats supposed to last and never dies

[Chorus repeat until fade]
