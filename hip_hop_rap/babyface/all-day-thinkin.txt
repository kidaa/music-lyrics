You get inside of me and I don't even
Know how to act, girl
You have synergy that gets in me that's
That's better than sex
When we get inimate it's got to be as
As good as it gets
And I just can't wait to get home

Your sexuality it smothers me and
And less I forget
My own reality is fantasy it's
I just got to admit
That I desire you and think of you like
Like all thru the day
That I just can't wait to get home

Girl I be
All day, all day, all day
All day thinkin' about you
I be
All day, all day, all day
All day dreamin' about you

You are the good in me, the bad in me
The love of my life
You are the up in me, the down I me
The love of my life
And you are there for me to care for me
At the end of each day
And I just can't wait to get home
Your sexuality, it captures me
And blows me away
That I must think of thee at least a thousand
A thousand times a day
