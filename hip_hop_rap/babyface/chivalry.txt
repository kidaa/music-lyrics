My friends tell me
That he's been cheating on you
And that he treats you unkindly
He's using you
My friends tell me
That he keeps messing around
And that your love is so blinded
You think that it's it cool

Well, he never sends you roses
He never kisses you goodnight
He never thinks about your anniversary
He says he don't have time

Well, I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use

What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty
What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty

My friends tell me
That he's been bragging about
All of the girls that he's doing
All over town
My friends tell me
He's putting you down
And you're so in love you can't tell
He is turning you out

Well, he never sends love letters
He never takes you out at night
He never wines and dines your heart
He says he don't have time

Well, I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use
