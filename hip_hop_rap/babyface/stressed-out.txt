Make you dreams come true 
No noooo hooo ooo ooo oo ooh oooh ohhh ooooh oooh ooh 
You so busy 
Worryin' bout 
All of the thing you can to do nothing about 
Maybe its time to change your route 
Instead of pluggin in so much 
You should look out 
You have so many things to smile about 
Like Love 
For all the things you have ever dreamed 
It could work out 
So don't stress out oh baby 
It will happen if its meant to be 
So don't stress out 
Things could work out baby 
We go 'round mmm 
Only once 
Don't waste you time not having fun 
You should live your life, its all you got 
Like its always better to live than not 
You have so many things to smile about 
Like Love 

Chorus x 2 

Laid back in my arms 
Is where you belong 
Sunshine will defeat the storm 
At the end of the day 

Chorus x 2 

So don't stress out 
Things could work out baby 

Chorus
