Sometimes I feel so alone
I call your heart
But there's no one at home
Taking a toll on my pride
I'm reaching out
But there's no one inside

It doesn't feel right, when I look in your eyes
I know love is blind, but the heart doesn't lie
I'll ask one more time, maybe this time you'll try
So tell me girl what's deep in your heart

Girl I care 'bout you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me
Like I care 'bout you

I spend like all of my days
Trying to cess out just how things got this way
I thought that we were in love
But I swear right now I don't know what you want

I make sure that I give you quality time
But lately I feel you're not home by design
But still I'm gonna try, you're the love of my life
In hopes that you will open your heart

[HOOK]

Sometimes I'm not sure
I'm all you've got
Sometimes I'm not sure if you love me or not
One thing I know
Girl I care for you
And the one thing that I want is that you care for me too

[HOOK 2 times]
