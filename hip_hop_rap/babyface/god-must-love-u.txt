[Verse 1]
God must love you i said to myself
Cause your more beautiful than 
anybody else
God must adore you, its easy to tell
Must be wonderful to wake up to yourself
From the moment i first saw you
Had a vibe thats fit to kill
It was then you know that i knew love was real

[Chorus]
On the day i met you, you were so so chill
On the day i fell in love with you my heart stood still
And i never saw this happening to me
Its like something coming over me
I never thought that i could be

[Verse 2]
God must love you he's proud of himself
When he made you girl he broke the mold for real
Theres just something bout you that you cant even tell
Its the way you flow you dont even know that you got that wip appeal
From the moment i first saw you, had your vibe on "set to kill"
It was then you know that i knew love was real

[Chorus 2x]

Never thought love could be real
Suddenly i see your face and i get chills
And everything i never thought i could feel is for real
Love is real

[Chorus 2x]
