How can I forget about the day I first met you 
The way you walked in to the room with so much attitude 
Sometimes people go through life 
Searching for a sign 
Girl I know that I found mine 
When I look into your eyes 

Chorus Outside in, inside out, you do it for me ya knock me out a sight to 
see from head to toe 
had to let you know 
Outside in, inside out, you do it for me ya knock me out a sight to see from 
head to toe 
had to let you know 

Girl I lost my mind I saw you dancin on the floor 
You looked so damn fly sweat started comin from my pores 
Soemtimes people go through life 
Searching for the one 
Girl I know that I found mine 
And I know its love 

Chorus

Tell me when and if I can see you 
How's about tomorrow night 
No one has to know what we do what we do til ya say until say it's alright 
its alright, its alright baby, its alright baby 
It's alright baby, It's alright baby
