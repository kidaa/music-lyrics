So ya never meant to hurt nobody 
Well I think your full of it 
'Cause if ya really really didn't wanna hurt nobody 
You wouldn't slept with my best friend 
And I bring insult to my injury 
You weren't a bit discrete 
And while the world stood witness 
To my embarrassment 
You put a knife inside of me 

Chorus:
How could you fall in love with him 
How could you give your heart to him 
Thought we'd grow old 
As lovers 
Together til' the end 
How could you fall 
fall in love with him 

Now I know we've had our, up and downs 
And that I do admit 
But sometimes lovers go astray 
But you've made it permanent 
Oh I can't be there understanding 
My heart's just not that big  no it ain't, no it ain't 
And I can take the pain 
Of infidelity 
But I can't take you with him 

Chorus

Thought we'd grow old 
As lovers 
Together til' the end 
How could you fall 
Fall in love with him
