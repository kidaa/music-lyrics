It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the Earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay 
To hear the angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King of Israel
