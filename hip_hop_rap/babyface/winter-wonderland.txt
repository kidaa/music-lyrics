Sleigh bells ring, are ya listin'
In the lane, snow is glistnin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winger wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is possum brown
He'll say, "Are you married", we'll say, "No man!"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is possum brown
He'll say, "Are you married", we'll say, "No man!"
You can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
