[Verse 1]
Im sitting here 
Thinking bout
How im gon-na do without 
You around in my life and how am I
I gon' get by 
I ain't got no days 
Just lonely nights 
You want the truth
Well girl im not alright
Feel out of place and out of time 
I think im gonna lose my mind
[Chorus]
So tell me how you feel im lonely
Are you for real so lonely
Do you still think of me i think of you
Baby still You only
Do you dream of me at night like i dream of you all the time
So let me tell you how it feels its like everyday i die
Wish i was dreaming but its real when i open up my eyes
Let me tell you how it feels and don't see your pretty face
I think that i will never love again
[Verse 2]
I miss your face 
I miss your kiss 
I even miss the arguments 
That we would have from time to time
I miss you standing by my side 
I'm dying here its clear to see 
There ain't no you, God knows there ain't no me 
Don't wanna live, I wanna die
If I cant have you in my life
[Chorus repeat till end]
So tell me how you feel im lonely
Are you for real so lonely
Do you still think of me i think of you
Baby still You only
Do you dream of me at night like i dream of you all the time, so lonely
Oh let me tell you how it feels its like everyday i die
Wish i was dreaming but its real when i open up my eyes
Let me tell you how it feels and don't see your pretty face
I think that I will never love again
