Baby, baby
Don't 'cha think
You would like to
Spend the night with me
Darlin', darlin'
Can't you see
That you and I were
Always meant to be

Baby if you believe in magic
Baby I'll reach for the stars
And I'll bring the dream to you
Whatever you wish for you can have it
It'll come straight from the heart
Baby 'cause I, I want you
To want me like I do want you

I can't stop my heart, I'm in love
You're the only one that I want
I want it, I need it
I wanna be the one and only one you love

I want it, I need it
I wanna be the one and only one you love

Girly, girly
It's plain to see
Ain't no other
Place I'd rather be
Girly, baby
Live with me
I'll make you happy
And that I guarantee

Baby 'cause I believe in magic
Baby I wished upon a star
And I found a dream called you
Baby 'cause you can make love happen
Let it fall straight from your heart
Baby 'cause I, I want you
To want me like I do want you

[HOOK]

Baby 'cause I, I want you
To want me like I do want you

[HOOK 2 times]

I want it, baby I need it
I wanna be the only one, the only, only, only, only one

[HOOK]
