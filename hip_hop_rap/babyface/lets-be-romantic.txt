Let's be romantic baby
Let's stay in love

When I think of the magic
And all that it means to me girl
Girl I get so, so excited
Thinking of love and all it's possibilities
And to think of the madness
So many broken homes, so many broken hearts
Well baby that won't be you and me
Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we're boundless through time

Let's be romantic baby
Let's be the ones who stay in love
Let's make a promise
Let's stay in love

Just to think of us is magic
It's such a sweet melody
Baby, afraid that we don't abuse it
For darling a love like this to go so easily
Oh to think of the sadness
So many hearts all day are lost and torn apart
Baby that won't be you and me
Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we'll last through all time

[HOOK]

Let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
All we gotta do is just keep it up
Keep on giving up my love
Let's show the world that we're still in love
One love is greater than all

Let's be, let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
Let's be the ones
Let's stay in love

Let's be, let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
Come on my sugar
Love, hey yeah

Let's be romantic
Let's stay in love
All we gotta do is just keep it up
Keep on giving up my love
Let's show the world that we're still in love
One love is greater than all

[HOOK 4 times]
