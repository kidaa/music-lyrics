What must I say to you
To get inside your head
Why must you always think
I Wanna get in your pants
And why I always gotta be
The closest thing to wrong
Sometime the only thing a brother need
He need a woman to be strong

Well I ain't cryin', I ain't cryin'
Done 'bout run out of tears
But you're the closest thing to heaven
I need you to be near
Hear me darlin', hear me darlin'
I can't make it more clear
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here

Ooo girl, talk to me
You're the only one that comforts me
My only reality is I want you for my woman
ooo girl, speak to me
Let me hear you sayin' that you're stayin' with me
I know my reality is without you
I ain't nothin' at all

Why does everything I say to you
Have to be suspect
Feel like the only way I'll get with you
Somethin' blows off my head
Well I ain't tryin' to go out like that
Wanna keep myself clean
Sometime the only thing a brother need
He need the strength from his queen

I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Done 'bout run out of time
The only time I wanna do it right now
Is feel you by my side
Hear me darlin', hear me darlin'
I can't be more sincere
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here

HOOK

Well I said everything's gonna be alright
When you stand by my side
Gonna work things out tonight
We're gonna make out just fine
For once I'd like you to be
The one who has the faith in me
And I promise I won't let you down this time

HOOK
