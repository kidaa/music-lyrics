You've been bad
You know you've been good
Did you lose your mind, like I knew you would

Did you sing your song
Did you sing it so loud
Did you sing it so everyone can hear in the crowd

Did you lose yourself
Did you lose your health
Did you put my memories on the shelf

Did you lose your place
Did you lose your grace
Just so everyone could see your singing face

Its like everybody loves you
And everybody wants you lately
Its like everybody needs you
And everybody sees you today

You've been sad
Your misunderstood
Did you find your kind,
Like i knew you would

Did you feel your song
Did you feel it so real
Did you feel it so everyone could see your grand appeal

Did you lose yourself
Did you lose your health
Did you put my memories on the shelf

Did you lose your place
Did you lose your grace
Just so everyone could see your singing face

Its like everybody loves you
And everybody wants you lately
Its like everybody needs you
And everybody sees you today
Today

If they would let me show
For the time we love
Time will say,
Keep the fun alive 
And lead the way to our today

Did you lose yourself
Did you lose your health
Did you put my memories on the shelf

Did you lose your place
Did you lose your grace
Just so everyone could see your singing face

Its like everybody loves you
And everybody wants you lately
Its like everybody needs you
And everybody sees you today

Its like everybody loves you
And everybody wants you lately
Its like everybody needs you
And everybody sees you today
Today
