Roll the carpet and pour out the wine
Treat me like its your first valentine
Cuz hunny baby youve been on my mind
Like all of us who have waited for a time

I'm calling can you hear me
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
the nite is the brightest
Who knows what I really will hear
What I really will say
What I really will feel
Who knows what you really will hear
What you really will say
What you really will feel

Wall the papers and call your friends
No longer do we have to pretend
Cuz hunny baby youve been on my mind
Like all of us who have waited for a time

I'm calling can you hear me
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The nite is the brightest
Who knows what I really will hear
What I really will say
What I really will feel
Who knows what you really will hear
What you really will say
What you really will feel

Quicken your beating drums and
Draw me some wildfires

I'm calling can you hear me
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The nite is the brightest
Who knows what I really will hear
What I really will say
What I really will feel
Who knows what you really will hear
What you really will say
What you really will feel
Repeat 3x

I'm calling can you hear me
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The nite is the brightest.
