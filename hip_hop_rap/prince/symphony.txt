I have a foot to wrestle, under the table.
And he will keep my toes warm late at night.
And I have a leg to pretzel while we're watching cable.
And he will wrap around me tight.

I have a sexy stomach to run my fingers along.
And he'll take off his shirt and drive me wild.
And I have an arm to hold me, and he's so strong.
And he will flex it with a smile.

You make me happy, when I feel too much.
And when my hand are cold, you warm them up.
And I'm not worried, when your not around.
And I hear symphonies...without a sound.
Without a sound.

I have two lips to tell me that I am loved.
And he will kiss me till I can't move at all.
And I have two eyes to melt me, I can't get enough.
And he makes me want to fall.

You make me happy, when I feel too much.
And when my hand are cold, you warm them up.
And I'm not worried, when your not around.
And I hear symphonies...without a sound.

I love you.
I love you.

You make me happy, when I feel too much.
And when my hand are cold, you warm them up.
And I'm not worried, when your not around.
And I hear symphonies...

I hear symphonies...
And I hear symphonies...
Without a sound.
YEE-HAW!!!
