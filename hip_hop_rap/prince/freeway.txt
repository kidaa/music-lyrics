How many times did you tell me to leave?
How many times did you leave me to freeze?
You live a dramatization
Your education seems to only come from TV I say
You live and breather but your vision ain't clear
You can't beloeve everything that you hear
You got some misinformation
Your own creation the fantasy life you need I say

CHORUS
Everything that you thought you had
Was everything that you wish you had back
I'm on the freeway tonight
Everything that you had to give
Was everything that you needed to live
I'm on the freeway tonight
Everything that you thought was here
Was everything that could just disappear
I'm on the freeway tonight
Everything that was right in your face
Was everything that couldn't be replaced
I'm on the freeway tonight

But before I leave you there is something you should know
All I ever wanted was to touch your empty soul
Everything I had I offered you a hundred times
The offer's off the table and now I'm floating high

How many roles can you play in a day?
How much stupid s*** can one girl say?
I think you need an ovation
A celebration celebrating me on my way I say
Now it don't seem that you're losing your cool?
You can't believe that I'm breaking your rules
This is a new revelation
A new vacation leaving you behind on the dock I say

CHORUS

But before I leave you there is something you should know
All I ever wanted was to touch your empty soul
Everythign I had I offered you a hundred times
The offer's off the table and now I'm floating high

My boys they tell me 'Wax you on a one way street'
Under construction Lovers Lane ain't quite complete
I should have woke up all the s*** you talk I had to soak up
Heard your friends were bumping Scapegoat Wax
And now you're broke up
Your fake dramatics witch tactics soap operatics
Are even worse when they get cinematic
On my barometer floating so high I see Andromeda
Too hot for hot blew the red out the thermometer

I'm on the Freeway tonight

CHORUS
