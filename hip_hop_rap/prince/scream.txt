if you ever want to come home from chicago   leave the things that habit made you love, ill
be there to await your arival, to give you a life you've never known
the street lights blind my eyes through a  shade thats half way pulled. cracklin'
light side interupts the radio in my head.  speeding through a familiar self i dont
know all too well. find a glimps of you outside my home
if you ever want to come home from chicago..   leave the things that habit made you love, ill
be there to await your arival, to give you a life you've never known
sometimes i get the feeling  that im not the only one, somehow my silence speaks
for itslef. as i stroll down this street, i pray for a chance ill see you there. this time
i think ill sheve my life with you.
