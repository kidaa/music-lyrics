Well I'm tied to her memory
And I'm stuck fast in time
I only wanna be back where she was mine.

Why aren't you with me now?
Well I can't break you free no-how
- You're part of my life.

We'd meet in crowded places but I'd see only you.
I was so full of feelings I didn't know what to do.

Why aren't you with me now?
Well I can't break you free no-how
- You're part of my life.

You're stuck in this heart of me
Stuck in my soul.
I'm stuck with this thought of you
An' I can't break you loose
Well it ain't no use
You're stuck tight
- Part of my life.

Why aren't you with me now?
Well I can't break you free no-how
- You're part of my life.

Well I tried to forget you
I guess I don't know how.
I thought that I'd be over you, by now.

Why aren't you with me now?
I can't break you free no-how
- You're part of my life.

You're part of my life
Well I can't break you loose
An' it ain't no use.
