I miss you in my empty heart
miss you in this empty room
miss you in this empty world of mine
I miss you in my fantasies
miss you in the dreams I dream
I miss you in this lonely world of mine

I'm so afraid to let you know how I feel
cause I believe that what we have is for real

You're in every thought of mine, You're my after rain come shine
you're what makes my heart beat faster and you're my very true love master
and then I finally understood that I won't stop loving you

I miss you every lonely day
I miss you every lonely night
miss you in this lonely world of mine
I miss to hear you call my name
miss your kisses oh nothing's the same
I miss you in this lonely world of mine

I'm so afraid...

you're in every thought of mine....
