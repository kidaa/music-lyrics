So you think you've got friends in high places
With the power to put us on the run
Well, forgive us these smiles on our faces
You'll know what power is when we are done
Son...

You're playing with the big boys now
Playing with the big boys now
Ev'ry spell and gesture
Tells you who's the best, you're 
Playing with the big boys now

You're playing with the big boys now
You're playing with the big boys now
Stop this foolish mission
Watch a true magician
Give an exhibition how
Pick up your silly twig, boy
You're playing with the big boys now!

Hotep and Huy
You're playing with the big boys now
You're playing with the big boys now
By the might of Horus
You will kneel before us
Kneel to our splendorous power...
You put up a front
You put up a fight
And just to show we feel no spite
You can be our acolyte
But first, boy, it's time to bow
Kowtow!
Or it's your own grave you'll dig, boy
You're playing with the big boys now
Playing with the big boys
Now!
