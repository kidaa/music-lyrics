I am the serial killer
I am the bloody hand
I am the chief whore taker
I am the chosen one.
I am the red staight razor,
The one who bathes in blood;
I am the boogey-man, I am
The empty yawning hood,
Look not for pity, no;
I am the heartless man,
I come to fix all things,
I am the one man band.
You cannot yet imagine,
How you will dance for me;
But you will dance forever
To the tune that I decree.
The kingdom of the worm,
Is all things to us all,
But I will teach you many things,
before I let you fall.
I am the black dead nightmare.
I bring a light so bright;
To illuminate the path we take;
I show the way that all hearts break,
And I will see the old world's back be broken
As we descend into the awful
Howling,
Night.
