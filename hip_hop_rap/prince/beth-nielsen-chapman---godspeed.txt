Chorus
Godspeed your souls return 
Deep from these waters 
Straight to the angels arms 
Beyond the sea 

How sweet the days gone by 
How sharp the corners 
How blue the canvas sky 
That set you free 

Bridge
And oh somehow I know we're not apart 
For I still hold your love inside my heart 

How soft this light of grace 
Shines through my sorrow 
From some amazing place 
You reach for me 

Repeat Bridge 

Repeat Chorus
