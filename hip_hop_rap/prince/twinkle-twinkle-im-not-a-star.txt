I like to dream, yes I do

Right between the sound machine

On a cloud of sound I drift in the night

Every place she goes is right

Flies far, flies near

To the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what

We can find

Why don't you come with me little girl

On a magic carpet ride

Well, you don't know what

We can find

Why don't you tell your dreams to me

Fantasy will set you free

CHORUS

Close your eyes girl

Look inside girl

Let the sound take you away

Last night I found Aladdin's lamp

So I wished that I could stay

But before the thing could answer me

Someone came and took the lamp away

I looked

Around

A lousy candle's all I found

Well, you don't know what

We can find

Why don't you come with me little girl

On a magic carpet ride

Well, you don't know what

We can see

Why don't you tell your dreams to me

Fantasy will set you free

CHORUS
