you/KiMoNo

All i need, all i need...
Ecstasy....
Coffee flavour and strawberry machine and my mysery...
Burn me when i'm too cold,
Kill me when i'm on top.
You can, you can.
All i need, all i need, all i need...
Ecstasy, ecstasy...
I burn and you burn down on me cause you are a miracle, just a
miracle.
I saw you upon my skin,
He's dreaming, he's feeling...
You/kimono.
Fuck you all music sons, fuck you! music sons.
Cry for me when i'm gone,
Take me over the sun.
You can, you can.
Coffee flavour and strawberry machine and my mysery.
I burn and you burn dowm on me cause you are a miracle, just a miracle.
...and nothing is done and your shadow on me,
And it's calling my mind,
Shouting and screaming,
Feel me white, again and again.
Cry for me when i'm gone,
Take me over the sun,
Kill me when i'm on top.
I burn and you burn dowm on me cause you are a miracle ,just a miracle
