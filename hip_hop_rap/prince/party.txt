The week's end, tonight tonight
Well it's the weekend, come on, all right

Party, Party, Party, Party

For a good time, stand in no line
For the best time, stand in no line

Party, Party, Party, Party

Shake down, break down, everybody's coming 'round,
The whole place jumping up, the people coming, 
All the high kids coming

Party, Party, Party, Party
