Well i hope that i dont fall in love with you
Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Where the music plays a new display of hard for me to see
I head a beer and now i hear you calling out for me
And i hope that i dont fall in love with you 
Now the night does funny things inside a man
These old tom cat feelings you dont understand
I turn around a look at you you light a cigarette 
I wish i had the guts to bum one but we've never met
And i hope that i dont fall in love with you
I can see that you are lonesome just like me 
And it being late you'd like some company well i've had two i look
At you and you look back 
At me the guy you're with is up 
And split that chair next to you is free
And i hope that you dont fall in love with me
Now it's closing time
The music's fadding out
Last call for drinks 
I have another staff
I turn around and look at you
You're no where to be found 
I search the place for your lost face
And have another round
And i think that i just fell in love with you
