He was a king 'til she laid waste
now he can not fill up the space
and I just see him drifting
while he's drifting
on bourbon alley, feeling low
just because she let him go
I don't think he even knows
he'll ever be fine

And he's got a head full of ideas
let me tell ya, that you wouldn't believe
and he's got a heart made of pure gold
and something else, many tricks up his sleeve
you might think he's a jester
because he'll make you laugh til' you cry
and what else, you better come with your best
if you test him, unless you're ready to die

Wonder woman got rid of wonder man
that man's not part of your wonder plan
letter to the so called better bet on my man
believe it you will find out baby, damn

Head full of ideas
let me tell ya, that you wouldn't believe
and he's got a heart made of pure gold
and something else, so many tricks up his sleeve
you might think he's a jester
because he'll make you laugh til' you cry
and what else, you better come with your best
if you test him, unless you're ready to die

A million people come and go
through a persons ebb and flow
and faces keep on changing
while there changing
a certain few will stay in tact
when they're not they'll don an act
I know this important fact
don't get confused like

And he's got a head full of ideas
let me tell ya, that you wouldn't believe
and he's got a heart made of pure gold
and something else, so many tricks up his sleeve
you might think he's a jester
because he'll make you laugh til' you cry
and what else, you better come with your best
if you test him, unless you're ready to die

First you love him then your loving him not
all the while he just smiles, giving all that he's got
do you find it in your heart to say he's not what you sought
do you want me to continue with this, or what

woahohohohohohohooh yeah
woahohohohohohohooh yeah

Head full of ideas
let me tell ya, that you wouldn't believe
and he's got a heart made of pure gold
and something else, so many tricks up his sleeve
sleeve, sleeve
