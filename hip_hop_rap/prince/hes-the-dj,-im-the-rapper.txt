Uh uh, ah uh
Yo Jeffrey Buss it
What are ya doin in there?
Word em up word em up word em up
In the place at about this time
DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince just bu bu buggin out
Losing it all no sense
Ay Jeff scratch it scratch it man, scratch it
Uh aw that was decent
Now scratch it a quick joint, a quick one Jeff
Oh yeah yeah
We just bugging we just having some fun
Me and Jeffrey
He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper
Hello can anybody hear me
You can aight that's good you can hear me
Okay it's clear it's good okay everybody's got it
One two
One two and
My rhymes have been written not to be bitten
But as it seems, some suckers keep forgetting the rules about rappin, but that's alright
Cause in the next five minutes I'm a have them all uptight
Stronger than a dinosaur, better known than Santa
Man the battles I battle, I usually win em 
In less than a minute, but it all depends
On how long it takes you rappers to realise
That trying to defend yourself is ridiculous
Didn't you get my message its out of the question
Cause you're toys boys, I'm the Real McCoy
I'm really gonna enjoy seeing you destroyed
If I was Fred Flintstone I'd probably own all of Bedrock
If I was a criminal I'd probably own a cellblock
If I was in the Navy I would own the sea
But I'm a poet so I own the whole rap industry
I'm like a lion my man, and the streets are my den
It's either kill or be killed, so I kill
I kill again and again and again
Surmount the times, rappers I'll slaughter them
I tie em up and throw them in the water
Then I'll just walk away like nothing ever happened until somebody else starts rappin
That's when I snap and I'll attack and go mad like Rambo or maybe like Commando, or like Lando
Calrissian, cause you know he was down with the Force
Fresh Prince is the source I feel no pain or remorse
Think that you can beat me rappin man you must be silly
Man I really really really really really really
Hate when people, doubt my ability
And I have to prove superiority
If rap was basketball, I would be in luck
Cause every time I freestyle it would be a slam dunk
Man I'm the engineer, and you're the passengers
Taking on a voyage, a hip-hop massacre
The Jason of rap, Freddy Kruger of rhymin
And I'm sure that you'll see in due time man
People will run, to Philadelphia Pennsylvania to all join in, to this Fresh Prince mania
My face in magazines, on your radio or stereo
Everywhere you go, audio and video
A hip-hop terrorist, war like vocalist
Other rappers say, yo Prince why don't you show me this
Style now you must be trippin it ain't no way in hell I'ma let you put your lip in
My rhyme cause it's a timebomb, I'm not kiddin
My rhyme explodes the second it gets bitten
I'm quick and nimble, a status symbol
I shop at Macy's now but I used to shop at Gimble's
I'll, drop kick a hurricane, bodyslam a tidal wave
Walk through a tornado, or a volcano
But I'll be okay though
And here's some more info that you rappers should know
You are the bombs and I will defuse you
I am the lawyer and I'm going to accuse you of the ultimate rhyme crime and you will be guilty
There's no way that you'll ever ever defeat beat me rappin any time or day
Pop so much trash, man I can't wait to be face to face, and hear Jeff say sick em
Man you're gonna be my victim
You better duck, and pray for good luck Chuck, cause you're stuck
You're like a Thanksgiving turkey and it's time to be plucked
I see you're nervous purpose that's how I now you're soft
You're runnin round like a chicken with your head cut off
But just relax my power to the max
And I'm cuttin no slack on this rap track, Jack
So back up, as if you got good sense
Or feel the fury of the Prince
And ya don't stop
Yo Jazzy why don't you rock up the spots
Yo Jazzy hey Jeff I'm psyched I'm psyched
Give em a cut Jeff
Ooh-wee check out my dish-jockey!
Ay Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey, a fast one
Uh ha yeah
Wow, ay Jeff Jeff, give em one of them fresh ones
A fresh one Jeffrey
No music, no music
Woo, that was decent, that was decent
That's my DJ, that's my DJ
Jazzy Jeff, I'm the Fresh Prince
Hi how ya doin?
How's everyone doin out there?
Ooh!
I'm just here to talk about my DJ
I was just I was just standin in here, really
Really? Aight, okay, um
On behalf of DJ Jazzy Jeff, and the Fresh Prince ..
Don't touch that dial
Thank you, and good night
