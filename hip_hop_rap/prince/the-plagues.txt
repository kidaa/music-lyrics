From Prince of Egypt Soundtrack


Chorus
Thus saith the Lord:
Since you refuse to free my people
All through the land of Egypt...

I send a pestilence and plague
Into your house, into your bed
Into your streams, into your streets
Into your drink, into your bread
Upon your cattle, on your sheep
Upon your oxen in your field
Into your dreams, into your sleep
Until you break, until you yield
I send the swarm, I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord

Moses
Once I called you brother
Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh
Was all I ever wanted...

Chorus
I send the thunder from the sky
I send the fire raining down

Moses
And even now I wish that God 
had chose another
Serving s your foe on his behalf
Is the last thing that I wanted...

Chorus
I send a hail of burning ice
On ev'ry field, on ev'ry town

Moses
This was my home
All this pain and devastation
How it tortures me inside
All the innocent who suffer
 From your stubbornness and pride...

Chorus
I send the locusts on a wind
Such as the world has never seen
On ev'ry leaf, on ev'ry stalk 
Until there's nothing left of green
I send my scourge, I send my sword
Thus saith the Lord!

Moses
You who I called brother
Why must you call down another blow?

Chorus
I send my scourge, I send my sword

Moses
Let my people go

Moses and Chorus
Thus saith the Lord

Rameses
You who I called brother
How could you have come to hate me so?
Is this what you wanted?

Chorus
I send the swarm, I send the horde...

Rameses
Then let my heart be hardened 
And never mind how high the cost may grow
This will still be so:
I will never let your people go...

Chorus
Thus saith the Lord:

Moses
Thus saith the Lord:

Rameses
I will not...

Moses, Rameses, and Chorus
Let your my people go!
