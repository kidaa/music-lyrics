Miriam
Many night's we've prayed 
With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hopeful song 
We barely understood, 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could 

Miriam chorus 

There can be miracles 
When you believe 
Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
When you believe 
Somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

Tzipporah

In this time of fear 
When prayer so often proved in vain 
Hope seemed like the summer birds 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
With heart so full I can't explain 
Seeking faith and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 

Miriam and Tzipporah chorus 

There can be miracles 
When you believe 
All hope is frail 
Its hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
Somehow you will 
You will when you believe
