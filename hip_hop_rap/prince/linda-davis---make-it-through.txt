Well the sun beats down and the sand gets hot 
Where I break my back hauling endless rock 
For a man made God 
I really don't believe in 
I shoulder the rope and I bear the strain 
Wipe the salt from my eyes and ignore the pain 
Though I know when I fall 
Another whip is coming 
When I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

I'm a prisoner here in this hall of kings 
I'm gold I'm jewels I'm a diamond ring 
To be given as a token of God's affection 
The law says I'm their property 
But my heart and my soul belong to me 
They can hold me but I'll never be in their possession 
When I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

Through the doubt 
Give me strength to lead them out 
Give them faith to follow me 
Guide us through the sea 

So help me God I'm a common man 
With the lives of thousands in my hands 
As I carry them into the land you promised 
And when I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

I know if I keep my faith in you 
We're gonna make it through
