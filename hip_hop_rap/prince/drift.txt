I remember when we fell,
You took my whole life, my breath away,
I remember when we kissed, as you drift into the sun,
So take the ride, now you take the fall and,
You weigh so shallow,
Wait for me, before you take it all away. 
Far away,
It's not like I wanted to,
Far away, 
It's not like I could breathe anymore,
Far away,
It's not like, I wanted you,
But you're not for me, not for me anymore.

I remember when we met,
It took your whole life, your breath away
I remember when we kissed, as you drift into the sun,
So take the ride, now you take the fall and,
You weigh so shallow,
Wait for me, before you take it all away.

Far away,
It's not like I wanted to,
Far away, 
It's not like I could breathe anymore,
Far away,
It's not like, I wanted you,
But you're not for me, not for me anymore.

Not for me,
Not for me,
Not for me,
Not for me.

Far away,
It's not like I wanted to,
Far away, 
It's not like I could breathe anymore,
Far away,
It's not like, I wanted you,
But you're not for me, not for me anymore.

Not for me,
Not for me,
Not for me,
Not for me.
