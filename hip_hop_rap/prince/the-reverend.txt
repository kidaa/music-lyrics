If you're wondering who I am
Well I'm a girl who can handle a man
I don't have time for little boys
I want a man with man size toys

I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me
I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me

Oh yeah baby, you're so hot
Yeah, right

Have a drink and throw me down
I'm the sluttiest girl in town
Leather pants and high heeled shoes
Lipstick markings on your tattoos

I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me
I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me

Oh baby, oh yeah, oh
Yeah, right!

Yo, I'm Vanilla Ice and I'll be your dream
So won't you open up your legs and I'll make you cream
Just like a waterfall
You know I got it all
A long white dick almost ten inches tall

M-hmmm

Pull it out and I'll be the judge
I'll let you know if you're well-hung
I'll feel you up and I'll check for size
If it's puny don't waste my time

I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me
I am a size queen, down and dirty, just give it to me

Hey stud boy standin' there at the back of the bar
I bet you think you're real well hung
Yeah, right!

Oh, yeah...stick it in...

Oh, give it to me baby
