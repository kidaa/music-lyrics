From Prince of Egypt Soundtrack


I wonder what life has in store for me
I think a painter is what I'll be
Mix the black with the white
On the canvas of life
Create the artistry
The picture is humanity

One world with so many tongues
Must now sing the song unsung
Just one melody
So let your voices ring
Create the harmony
The song is humanity

Na na na...............
One people one planet
Don't take your brother for granted
Na na na...............
Shake a hand make a friend
And let the love begin

At the sound of the drum
The race is run
Man vs. Man
For number one
But if we call it a truce
There's no way we could lose
A winner's vanity
In such insanity
There's just one race humanity
