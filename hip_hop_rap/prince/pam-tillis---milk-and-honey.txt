Written by Marty Stuart and Pam Tillis 

As the fireflies buzzed around him 
Like so many dancing stars 
God told all the angels 
From Jupiter to Mars 
There's a basket in the river 
Bearing something dear to me 
Embarking on a journey 
To fulfill his destiny 

A pretty maiden on the banks 
Stood with open arms 
God put it in her heart 
To keep that baby safe from harm 
She said "don't matter where you come from 
Now you belong to me" 
She was wise enough to know 
It was simply meant to be 

God was there when the firefly lied 
At the angel's side 
And the maiden's heart 
As she played her part 
As she scooped him up 
Headed into town 
That's the way it all went down 
On the way to Holy Ground 
Milk and honey bound 

One night that little prince was tossed 
Into a stormy prophet's dream 
And it took a while for him to understand 
What he had seen 
When that boy became a man 
Those dreams they did transpire 
He wandered into the desert 
Where he talked to a bush of fire 

And a voice said 
"I'll be there, I'll be there 
I'll be there with you 
Deliver my people out of Pharaoh's chains 
And I will see you through" 

God was there in the prophet's dream 
And the sparkled stream 
That flowed from the rock 
In the burning bush 
On the mountain top 
All across that desert sand 
Fingerprints of the master's hand 
He cried out "Pharaoh 
I'm headin' back to town" 
That's the way it all went down 
Milk and honey bound 

Yeah, I've come to lead my people out 
Milk and honey bound 
I've come to lead my people out 
I've come to lead my people out 
Milk and honey 
Milk and honey
