I am tha Ressurection and tha Life
He who believes in me tho he die  yet shall re live
And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die
Shhhhhhhh  shut up bitch
Fear not them which kill tha body
Rather fear him thats able to destroy both body and soul in hell
Get the behind me Satan and push me along
All this power I will give the  if thou there
for will worship me  all shall be thine
Come with me bitch as we walk thru tha door backwards
Heaven in art which father our, Our father which art in heaven
