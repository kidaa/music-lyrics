Gary Burr/Sunny Russ 

This desert lies 
It's so unfair 
I think there's water everywhere 
I'm always fooled 
Just when I think I'm saved 

But I don't have the strength 
To do again 
What always comes undone 
Deliver me 
Please be the one 

I've thought I wasted all those prayers 
Till I looked up and you were there 
Oh in your eyes 
I see there's hope for me 

I need your love 
To finish off 
What others have begun 
Deliver me 
Please be the one 

Be the one who makes me see 
Be wonderful a reason 
Be the one who rescues me 
With a love I can believe in 

Let it be true 
That you can do 
What no one else has done 
Deliver me 
Please be the one 

Oh deliver me 
Please be the one
