You're the cool in the room.
You're the light in the moon.
Lift me up, pull me into you,
Pull me into

You're the dream that I'm not sleeping
Deep within me now
You're all the hope I've been keeping
Gonna show me how
To stay around

Chorus
Run with my good intentions
Run with the wheel behind me
Gotta new way of living
Gotta a new way to be 
You know you brought it down for me

For me pause

You didn't take the long way
You came straight through
To carry me away
Away with you

Chorus
Run with my good intentions
Run with the wheel behind me
Gotta new way of living
I've gotta a new way to be 
You know you brought it down for me
You brought it to me

I believe it can happen
I believe it's true
Love finally came down
Came down
And brought me to you

Chorus
Run with my good intentions
Run with the wheel behind me
Gotta new way of living
I've gotta a new way to be 
You know you've brought it down for me
Well you brought it to me
