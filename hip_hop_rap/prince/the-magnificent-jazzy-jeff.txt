Some DJ's are good
Some DJ's are fresh
Some DJ's are even def
But here's a little sumtin about my DJ 
the magnificent
Jazzy Jeff
So bust this beat
Well it's true that I'm the reigning kick of the throne
But with all my strength I couldn't do it alone
I need a DJ like Jazzy to back me up
So when I'm rockin on the mic he's on the cross fade cut
Scratching and mixing mixing and scratching
Second after second it's the record he's catching
His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle
With the turntables split and the mixer in the middle
Back and forth his hands fly with the speed of a cheetah that will puzzle your eye
Record after record he has no mercy
Cuts left cuts right then he cuts vice versa
I'm not exaggerating I said it and I meant it
I'll resent it if you say it is cut unprecedented
He's a lean mean wrecking machine
He gets respected like a king when he's on the scene
So bust a move cause you know he's def
He's my DJ 
the magnificent
Jazzy Jeff
People often ask me everytime I emcee
Why do I brag so much about my disc jockey
Well the reason that I brag and I boast the most
Is cause my DJ is the most from coast to coast
the magnificent Jazzy Jeff wack destroyer
Cutting up records like a samurai warrior
If your DJ's don't know who I'm talking too
I'm talking to you
So cut cause in a battle you cannot win
My DJ will tear your butt limb from limb
He's like a wanna be tank a hip hop rebel
And if you want a battle you best bring a shovel my man
So you can dig your grave cause there no way
That you could ever be saved
Cause the DJ cuts the records
To create the sound
the DJ cuts the records
He's the best around
the DJ cuts the records
You know he's down
His name is Jazzy Jeff aka Jeff Townes
Commanding the cut he's always on track
He's DJ Jazzy Jeff and he's a cut in the act
So for your personal safety you should be told
That my DJ Jazzy Jeff is
Out of control
oh my god
Aight Jazzy we gonna do a little sumthin different right now
This is what I want you to do for me
I want you to tell all these people your name Jazzy tell em your name
He's Jazzy Jazzy His name is Jeff
Now Jazzy I want you to tell all these people how many of these DJ's out there can get with you none of them
Now make the record burp
Say excuse me
Now make the record sound like a bird
Now make it chirp
Now heres a story that should not be forgotten about the day my DJ turned into an autobot
He got struck by lightning in an electrical storm
He got on the wheels of steel and began to transform
His name is Jeff and he's the swift of the swift
The type that other DJ's do not want to have to reckon with
He's by my side as I rock the mic
All of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you
They'll delight you you no that that's right
If you were a stick of dynamite his cuts would ignite you
The DJ on the wheels can be matched
So check out Jazzy Jeff with a cordless scratch
