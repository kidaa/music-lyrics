Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would sayWho knows if we'll meet along the wayFollow the brightest star as far as the brave may dareWhat will we find when we get there
La Sagrada Familia we pray the storm will soon be overLa Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb
Who knows where the winds will blow us, only a fool would sayWho knows if we'll ever reach the shoreFollow a rising sun with eyes that may only stareWhat kind of fire will burn us there? What kind of fire?Only a fool would say
La Sagrada Familia the wind has changed the storm is overLa Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lambLa Sagrada Familia we thank the Lord the danger's overLa Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land
Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of gloryAnd for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears
Who knows where the world may turn us, only a fool would sayWho knows what the fates may have in storeFollow the light of truth as far as our eyes can seeHow should we know where that may be? How should we know?
Then the angry skies, the battle cries, the sounds of gloryAnd for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears
Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would sayWho knows what's been lost along the wayLook for the promised land in all of the dreams we shareHow will we know when we are there? How will we know?Only a fool would say
La Sagrada Familia the war is won the battle's overLa Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lambLa Sagrada Familia we thank the Lord the danger's overLa Sagrada Familia behold the mighty handLa Sagrada Familia the night is gone the waiting's overLa Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land
Until the next timeUntil the next time
La Sagrada Familia
