Time has come, what's done is done
It's time to move on
To another place, another space, maybe circling some other sun
Don't ask why, don't ask how
I still can't explain
To say goodbye, goodbye for now till I see you again

In the sunlight that's where I'll be
In the moon night close your eyes, you will see me
In the sunrise in the twilight I'll be the morning and the evening star
I will be there with you wherever you are

Life is strange, such joy and pain
The betrayal and the kiss
It maybe meant to be, maybe destiny
Leads us down a path like this
Child is born, true love is sworn
All the in-between
Well you walk on, walk on until the path is gone
Learning love is the only everything

So it's goodnight, things go wrong
but it's alright
We're all just passin' through here
At the speed of light
