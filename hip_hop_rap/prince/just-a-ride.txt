Life is ever so strange
It's good for a change
You think you worked it out
Bang, right outta the blue
Something happens to you
To throw you off course
But then you

Break down
Yeah, you break down
Don't you break down
Listen to me
Because

CHORUS:
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you round and round
Sometimes you're up sometimes you're down
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget it's just a ride

Truth, you don't wanna hear
It's too much to take too much to take
Don't have to feel 
Out of control
So we make our plans make our plans
Ten times a day ten times a day
And when they don't go
Our way we

Break down
Yeah, we break down
Don't you break down
Listen to me
Because

CHORUS:
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you round and round
Sometimes you're up sometimes you're down
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget it's just a ride

Slowly
Oh so very slowly
Except that
There's no getting off
So live it
Just gotta go with it
'Cause this rides, never gonna stop

Break down
Yeah you break down
No need to break down
No need at all
Because

CHORUS:
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you round and round
Sometimes you're up sometimes you're down
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
Don't be scared, now dry your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget enjoy the ride

It's just a ride
It's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you round and round
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
Don't be scared, now dry your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget enjoy the ride
