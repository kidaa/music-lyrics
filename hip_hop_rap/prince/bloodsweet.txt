You dont like me
Well i don't like you either
But we could go home]
She talks in paragraph
Rambling paragraphs 
About her work on a sunday
She wants my autograph
But she dont wanna ask
She's gonna get it one day
Faces faces faces
I didnt want it to happen this way
Everything you die for
I wouldnt live for
But thats ok

Chorus:
I rained on the princess parade
She's just a beautiful girl
Who was raised in the shade
Freash meat and the blood is so sweet
And she knows, she knows

I cant recall 
A word she said at all
I just wanted to make her feel like something 
That she wasnt [she never was]
I cant recall
A move she made at all
I just wanted to make her feel like something 
That she wasnt [she never was]

Chorus

Braggadocio baby doll
Standing against a wall
She used to model for mervyns
I think she's a counterfeit
But i'd be on top of it
If she thought that i deserved it
Wasted wasted wasted
Poisonous games she loves to play
Everything you die for 
I wouldnt live for 
But thats ok

Chorus
