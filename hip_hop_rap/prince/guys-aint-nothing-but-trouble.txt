Well, what do we have here Daddy.
The lights are quickly changing.
Will I leave your heart along with the phone lines you're erasing.
A spineless ending.
Well, who would have guessed dear daddy.
Turned out to be a coward.
When I turned my back you cut my throat it bled for hours.
Was that your power.

Chorus
You, you're the lovely victim again.
You, well your heart is breaking.
You are the only one let down.
Are you really now.
Well, soon here we'll have dear Daddy with the next one on her knees.
And she's gonna call him daddy like the rest of them, like me.
How easy it will be Replacing me.
And what's that I hear now Daddy you're blaming it all on me.
Another she did you wrong and of course you had to leave.
And the yes men will agree.
You gave it everything.

Chorus
You with the advisors in your ear.
You did everything right it's clear.
I know I begged you to stay around.
But I'm gone now.

Bridge
Well, here's to you my darling leave.
You're stubborn and you're free and of course, right.
I don't respect the way you leave.
You can be no friend to me.
I'll say goodbye.

Chorus
