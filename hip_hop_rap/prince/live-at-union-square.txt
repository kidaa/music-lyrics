Shake up the picture the lizard mixture with your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers all of which I deny
I've said it again but could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride I couldn't really put it much plainer but I'll wait till you decide
Send me your warning siren as if I could ever hide

Last time la luna I light my torch and wave it for the new moon on Monday
And a firedance through the night I stayed the cold day with a lonely sattelite
New moon on Monday and a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely sattelite

Breaking away with the beast of both worlds a smile that you can't disguise
But every minute I keep finding clues that you leave behind
Save me from these reminders as if I forget tonight

This time la luna I light my torch and wave it for the new moon on Monday
And a firedance through the night I stayed the cold day with a lonely sattelite
New moon on Monday and a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely sattelite

I light my torch and wave it for the new moon on Monday
And a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely sattelite
New moon on Monday and a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely sattelite
New moon on Monday and a firedance through the night firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with I light my torch and wave it for the a lonely sattelite
New moon on Monday and a firedance through the night firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday and a firedance through the night firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a I light my torch and wave it for thelonely sattelite
