The F-L-Y guy
About to toss some action
Here I go again with a groove to move you
Somethin kinda smooth, you can bop your head to
Chill it, the feel, you can play it anytime
Its smooth, is the groove, play it back behind the rhyme
So please, put a freeze, on hooving and hollering
Fans deserve more, for their hip-hop dollar, man
And Im just the rapper to deliver
The rapper that can give a
Funky rhyme, flowing like a river
Silky, silky, kind to the ear
Diction perfect, rhymes all clear
Tempo moderate, this aint no marathon
Step back, new jacks, observe the paragon
Ha, who? what?, why?, when?
Dont be looking around clown, thats right, Im back again 
With the dopeness, youre head is bopping isnt it?
Yeah I thought so. Yo, Im just kickin it.

Yeah---
Just kickin it CYeah, Yeah

I really cannot kick it
Just kickin it
Jus watch me yall; Im jus kickin it C kickin it
Uh Just kickin it
Yeah, yo Im just kickin it

Just kick, and just kick it 
Just kickin it -Ooh 
Prepare for a voyage, just close your eyes
Who aint ready, holler out I
Well aint nobody hollering, cause all is perfect
The groove is a wave, and my rhymes a surfing
The track design
With a rhyme in mind
Bidi budup up up, the charges will climb
Every young rapper trying to get you to jump
But when youre all done jumpin, Im a git you what you really want 
Track by track displaying my ability
The man, FP, showing true dexterity
On the Mic, no rules are lawless
Wicked, and a kicker and my rhymes are flawless
So sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya
With a hit that youre gonna get mentally locked to
A hip-hop solid and all flow, flower
I post up, together, better than Noah
A cut, to kick it too, kind to the ear drum
All true poetry, for me yall be hearin some
So extra, extra, read all about it
I slam a the hell out of those that doubt it
Im rippin every city I been in
Coast to coast, not to boast, but Im winning
My fans are powerful, and thats the way Im living
All about effort yall


Yo, Im just kickin it
Uh Just kickin it
Yeah, yeah, Im just kickin it

Just kickin it
Come on. Come on, Im just kickin it

Just kickin it
Now, Im just kickin it

Just kickin it C Just kickin it
Lets take a trip, mellow out while Im rappin
Ya mind is the boat, and my rhymes the captain
So hoist a sail, and its time to flow
To a place that other rappers dont go
Welcome, welcome, into my territory
Everbody get on up, and get busy for me
Heads are boppin hard and fast
And now Im getting sued cause my groove caused whiplash
Everytime a rhymer tried to
Say something smooth, thatll move inside you
The way that you should feel when you hear a real rap
Is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax
A lyrical painter, the fresh prince
And yall a know of my Picasso essence
Musical passion, lovely isnt?
But aint nothin to it
Yo, Im just kickin it

Just kickin it- Just kickin
Check me, check me, just kickin it

Just kickin it- Just kickin it
Like Pronto yall, Im just kickin it

Just kickin it
Uh, Im just kickin it

Yo, Im out

Just kickin it

He-he-he-ha
Just kickin it
Just kickin it
Just kickin it
Just kickin it
