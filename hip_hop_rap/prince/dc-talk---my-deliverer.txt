Joseph took his wife and child 
And they went to Africa 
To escape the rage of a deadly king 
There along the banks of the Nile 
They listened to the song 
That the captive children used to sing 
They were singing... 
chorus
My Deliverer is coming 
My Deliverer is standing by 
Oh, my Deliverer is coming 
My Deliverer is standing by 
Through a dry and thirsty land 
Water from the Kenyan heights 
Pours itself out of Lake Sangra's 
Broken heart, its broken heart 
There in the Sahara winds 
Moses heard the whole world cry 
For the healing that would 
Flow from God's own scars 
I hear Moses singing 
repeat chorus 
He will never break his promise 
He was written it upon the sky 
My Deliverer is coming 
Oh, my Deliverer is standing by 
He'll come 'round 
He'll come 'round some day 
Just like He said He would 
repeat 2x 
I will never doubt His promise 
Though I doubt my heart 
Though I doubt my eyes 
repeat chorus 
Standing by, Oh He's standing by [5x] 
Oh, Deliver me, deliver me
