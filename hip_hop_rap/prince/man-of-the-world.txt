I want be a man of the world
Blood in my veins and a hurt in my heart
Hide in the street with the noise and the dirt
And the one still looking for a brand new start
Oh i've been sleeping far too long
Hiding out in a palace of gold
Show me one thing before i'm gone
It can't be bought it can't be sold
Show me how to come alive
Show me how to make you mine
Cause if you'd only be my girl 
I could be a man of the world
I could be a man of the world
