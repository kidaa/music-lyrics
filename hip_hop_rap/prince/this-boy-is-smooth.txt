Welcome to the cruel world.
Hope you find your way.
Welcome to the cruel world.
Hope you find your way.

Oh- Oh- it's a cruel world.
Try to enjoy your stay.
Yes, it is a cruel world when you're tryin' to get by.
Oh- Oh- it's a cruel world when you're tryin'
when you've seen the look in their eye.
Makes life hard living but I'm so, so scared to die.

Welcome to the cruel world,
welcome,
welcome.

Don't know how we've lasted here so long.
There must be more good than bad or we'd already be gone.
And if you get up to Heaven before I do, I'm gonna tell ya,
it's gonna be cruel there too,
cruel there too.
You can't hide from this cruel world cause there is no place to run.
You can't hide from the cruel world there just is no place to run.
It's been cruel from the beginning, it will be cruel when we're done.
So when I'm gone, I will gladly say goodbye.
When I am gone, I will gladly say goodbye,
and if you want to feel me, put your hands up to the sky.

Welcome to the cruel world,
welcome,
welcome.
Hope you find your way.
Try to enjoy your stay
