I Cant wait to be with you
I Cant wait to see you
I Cant wait to be with you
Loving you is all I wanna do
10 o clock your flight lands
Can't wait to hold the palm of your hands
Been seven long days since the last that I saw you
And every free moment I get I gotta call you
Taking every chance to glance at your cute face
And looking at your 8 by 10 in my suitcase
Ain't been with my honey in a long while
And when I get a hold of you mmm child ooh yeah
No telling what I might do
Cause I'm a be like a kid that got a toy that's brand new
Cant wait to hold you can't wait to see you
Can't wait to g you I cant wait to be with you

Loving you is all I wanna do
Being in love is like an amusement ride g
I feel like it's a party inside of me
Smile on my face and there's a twinkle in my eye
Time to go to work but it's so hard to say goodbye
And as I think of you its like I had a dream or two
I feel dizzy man where is she
Pick up the phone and call you about 3
Hello
Yeah baby its me
Just to hear your voice
Just the thought of you
Got me tripping that's why I just bought a new
Cellular phone so I don't have to postpone
When my beeper goes off no more running to a payphone
You're astounding that's why I'm expounding
So vivacious and baby your face is
That of a goddess
It's making me feel numb
Fe fi fo fum baby come and get some
of the man the myth somethin debonair
for that wife there as a pair we extraordinary
me and you as a team it's kind of swell in it
love is a hole and I tripped and I fell in it
from the mountain to the valley to the deep blue sea
all I can do is pray that you wanna be with me
I'm saying it's from my heart that's how you know that it's true

snap my fingers and tap my heels and then
abra cadabra right their beside you
but its seeming and dreaming that's all I could do
I'm at an airport and hour till flight time
Can't wait to have you to wreck up my site line
Got a warm feeling in my chest
Thinking of your soft caress
I miss you so much
It ain't enough to just reach out and touch
I want a hold your hand in my hand
And walk and talk barefoot in the sand
I can't wait to just see your smile
And I can't wait to be alone for a while
And I can't wait to do the things we do
Oh I cant wait I cant wait oh I cant wait to be with you
