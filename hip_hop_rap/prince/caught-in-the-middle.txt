here in this vortex my true self begins to show
where phantoms pass me by what secrets do they hold?
flesh torn upon the wheels of human frailty
part of me was fascinated by the cruelty
running from the madness running from this mirror of how i feel
a dream is just a shadow of something that i found real
black moon bad sleep - another side of me
black moon bad dreams - another side of me
in the temples i am kneeling fearing god
in the cinemas they are baying for some blood
horror began to dawn as fear played its part
the fear that cancels out the love that's in our heart
all the hurt we felt repeated down the line
the pain inflicted was the pain that we designed
i try escaping from the person that i am
here is the endless cycle break it if you can
black moon bad dreams - another side of me
black moon bad sleep - another side of me
