[Andre 3000] 
Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas... 
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas 
Yeah, go like this 

CHORUS: Andre 3000 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 

[Big Boi] 
A baby drama mama, don't like me 
She doing things like havin her boys come from her neighborhood 
To the studio tryin to fight me 
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out 
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out 
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck 
Private schools, daycare, shit, medical bills, I'll pay that 
I love your mom and everything, see I aint the one who laid down 
She wanna rip you up started cussin you all, my lawyer stay down 
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided 
She had fifths out, cookouts, on my child's birthday I aint invited 
Despite it, show her the utmost respect when I fall through 
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah 

CHORUS: 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 

[Andre 3000] 
Me and your daughter 
Got a special thang goin on 
You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this 
Feel this way forever 
You could plan a pretty picnic 
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson 

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm blind fine 
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline 
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream 
Bout that crib with the goodyear swing 
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever 
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever? 
Forever never seems that long until you're grown 
And notice that the day by day rule can't be too long 
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could 
Become a magician to abacadabra off to Sata 
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he 
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me 
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads 
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad 
So know just know that everything is cool 
Yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation 

CHORUS: 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 

[Big Boi] 
Uh, uh, yeah 
"Look at the way he treats me", shit, look at the way you treat me 
See your lil nose ass homegirls got they ass up in the creek G 
Without a pad on, you left the straddlin, ride this thing on out 
And the union girl aint speakin no more cuz my dick all in her mouth 
Know what I'm talkin about, jealousy, and fidelity, envy 
Cheating, beating, and to the G's they be the same thing 
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song 
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on 
You and your mama 

CHORUS: 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times 
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH] 
I am for real 
Never meant to make your daughter cry 
I apologize a trillion times
