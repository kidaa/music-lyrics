[introduction by Andre] 
Hello, well good evening ladies and gentlemen 
What we like to do right here, well first let me let you know who I am 
Well I go by the name of Andre3000 alright? 
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia right? 
You know right now everybody wants to be from space 
And folks like to be from the country and everything like that 
You know, like really like the South is like cool to be from the South right about now 
Girls listen up 

[Andre]
Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday mornin' 
I don't know, I'm so unstruct in between-tween 
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead; The average nigga on my corner yellin' what the fuck you mean-mean 
See we ain't even sing the mouth to chop counter-clock wise goes the neighborhood 
Hand me down some canned-goods, wont cut the Grei-pupon 
We got the layer-on, back to the drawing board can't afford to lose journey beyond 
One, slash one slash ninety-one, my teacher six foot incher man said sit down son 
And let me tell you like I heard it when I don't desert it 
It wadn't no other way to word it got my feelings scurred and 
By the, bullet of bad, the singer of sad, songs to make you long for your mom and your dad 
Plaid class with poke-a-dots, I hope you ain't mad 
Back up little mama I'm about to react 

[Chorus]
Yup, we ain't just funky but wild, ah-ah 
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah 
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah 

[Bridge]
People have ya party, but please dont be late 
Its to bounce rock roller-skate, bounce rock roller-skate 
Hey sexy mama, there's no time to waste 
Its to bounce rock roller-skate, bounce rock roller-skate 
At the party, fool around, ah baby 
People have ya party, dont be late 
Its to bounce rock roller-skate, bounce rock roller-skate 

[Big Boi] 
While Scotty is beaming LaPookie is skeeming 
Wait to you still live in my name-go, while you snoozing I'm dreaming 
I'm Tylenol PM, you mouth to the same thing everyday like Perdium 
Never try to be nothing but that what you're being, one nation under the cool should be the rule 
Wether young man or young lady begins or starts grade school 
Silence before violence, nine times out of ten times the quietest is the loudest 
Bumplin' through your privates, Daddy Fat Sacks can I have your back, Naw 
Ooh!, you're Such a playa, Ohh! your Southern ball 
Got me scrawled out, in ya black book my name was crossed out 
Went from starting the second string now in the dog house *WROOF* 
Remenicing, the party was missing, instead of arguements you think about the hugs and kisses 
If this is, something, hard for you to think, you better bounce, rock, roller-skate 

[Chorus]

[Repeat first line of Chorus]
