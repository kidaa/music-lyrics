Soul Food sountrack 

[Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
Just keep your faith in me 
Don't act impatiently 
You'll get where you need to be, in due time 
Even when things are slow 
Hold on and don't let go 
I'll give you what I owe, in due time 

[Big Boi] 
Uhh, uhh, yeah, check it 
When that * be thinkin of cruisin, the Braves cap is to the side 
Thinkin the police gon' pull me over with this herb off in my ride 
So I hide the brick of weed under the arm rest, under the leather 
And thinkin of startin ways to make my life a little bit better 
than the dope peddler, never to pay no * taxes 
Takin a chunk up out of my checks 
And makin my rhymes just look like practice 
Buyin clothing, Range Roving with my folks 
Don't speak about the Dirty South my crew ain't bout no jokes 
I know some people don't like the way we flow because they envy 
They talkin bout they * my * and that they could have been me 
You lookin to be the butterfly, without the caterpillar 
Take your time and do it right cause you gon' make it 
I swear my {nigga}, or collapse one 
Fallin a victim to your greed boi 
You're lookin to be Big Willie, but you're still a seed boi 
The information in my skull be pokin some of y'all on the shoulder 
But on the other side of the fence 
they got y'all {niggaz} breakin boulders for quick money 

[Cee-Lo]
Strugglin's just a part of my day 
Many obstacles have been placed in my way 
I know the only reason that I make it through 
Is because I never stop believin in you 
Some people wonder why we here in the first place 
They can't believe because they ain't never seen your face 
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try 
Can't wait for nobody to come down out the sky 
You've got to realize that the world's a test 
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest 
You've got your life, and got your health 
So quit procrastinatin and push it yourself 
You've got to realize that the world's a test 
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest 
You've got your life, and got your health 
So quit procrastinatin.. 

[Chorus]

[Andre Benjamin] 
Who said good folks is not supposed to die 
The same {nigga} that said {niggaz} is not supposed to cry 
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify 
I'm sure they got a cure for A.I.D.S. but yet it's classified 
You wonder why I spit the truth and not to make no dough 
To make a difference fo' this {motherfucker} up and blow 
in pieces, I could think of many reasons 
Only when {shit} is goin bad you want to holla Jesus 
I pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleedin 
From crawling , got these {niggaz} thinkin they really ballin 
when they isn't, don't take my word, there's {niggaz} off in prison 
that will tell you, that's locked up for long time and won't sell you 
no flex, so congregation will turn you text, 
To the book of OutKast, chapter two, verse one 
The first one that feel me, jump up and make a joyful noise 
You'se OutKasted; meanin, you now have a choice like that 

[Chorus] - 2X
