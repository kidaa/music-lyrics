[Verse 1]
You know I neva had time for the he say she say,
Cats act breezay I put em on the 3-way,
Coupes be coming, looking like a relay,
Don't catch it now, get it on the replay,
I'm in my game with some kid named Enrique,
Don't pump weight, don't see the D.A., 
What you hear now, is definitely not a cliche,
Ball so much, I be sold on E-Bay,
People thinking how close the lova,
They hear what's great, and I know some otha,
Some 12 years old, they had a poster of him,
Kids cry you gon get em close to hug em,
And this right here is my retro flow,
The prince of the air got to let you all go,
5 guys arrive when I step to the floor,
Flannels out, push your button and open the door

[Chorus]
If you rolling, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...
And say oh yeah....
And if you lonely, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put your drink up in the air... put em up
And say oh yeah.... put em up

[Bridge]
I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say let's work
Tell me what you say, I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say let's work
Tell me what you say

[Verse 2]
Now how did I get so popular,
The people watch you when you knock the laws,
Even when I'm eating at the lobster bar,
I come out, cops want to stop my car,
I move quick, I can't lolly-gag,
Jewels thick, it make my body drag,
I'm not just a star from the hood,
With money like this, it gotta be good,
Friends platonic, cars exotic,
You name it, you know I got it,
Flows so melodic, sort of hypnotic,
You ain't got to question, dude the kid got it,
Give me another topic, get low, rich low,
You can see this here from the 25th row,
VA to San Francisco, they married to this flow,
Keep the disco, popping like this go

[Chorus]
If you rolling, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...
And say oh yeah....
And if you lonely, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put your drink up in the air... put em up
And say oh yeah.... put em up

[Bridge]
I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say let's work
Tell me what you say, I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say let's work
Tell me what you say

[Verse 3]
It's the M to the A, crooked letter ON, B to the E to theT H A,
This here knock from the beach to the bay,
I'm in this, all the way down to Australia,
You can't come i'll mail ya,
A postcard, of the coast guard for the most part,
Paint my pictures as clear as Mozart's,
And these cats got no heart,
Oh my god, why I got the flow so hot,
I'm thinking now, of hot-hot foreva,
Crusing down on drop-drop whateva,
Cruising down the street on the drop-top carrera,
These cats here can't stop my chedda,
In my formal life there more chris than aguilera,
I roll through, people want to grab my sweta,
So I promised them I won't fly jets in bad weatha

[Chorus]
If you rolling, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...
And say oh yeah....
And if you lonely, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put your drink up in the air... put em up
And say oh yeah.... put em up

[Bridge]
I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say let's work
Tell me what you say, I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say let's work

[Chorus]
If you rolling, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...
And say oh yeah....
And if you lonely, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put your drink up in the air... put em up
And say oh yeah.... put em up
