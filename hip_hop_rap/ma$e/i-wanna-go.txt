Hey i juss wanna see you doin good

From the first day i met you, i knew you was special
You had lot of drama but i used to protect you
When you was nieve, yo i could not let you
Do a lot of things, so i had to correct you
You thinkin if you juss went left, instead of right
Right now what would your life be like
And me, you know i love the good life
And you, i know you hate the hood life
I watch you, as you turn and turn
And burn and burn from all your decisions
You could be a christian, rich somewhere
But you aint tru to listen, so get somwhere
Itz never to late til itz to late, right now, 
You is wit me, you be livin in a new state
Ridin around with new plates, livin in a new place
But you couldnt tell your crew, wait

[hook]
I wanna go back to the days
You used to say when you were lovin me
And i was lovin you
I wanna go
Cuz i would do many things so differently
Baby me and you, would still be together
Wanna go back to the days

You know i see you on the beach, feed her rose petals
I tell you the truth, but then you wanna go settle
A girl, like you is on another whole level
Try to move you out that hood, but you scared to leave the ghetto
I told you, anything you say you can have it
With me, i always spend a million on my fabric
Establish and lavage, karats since i have it
Im married, and i dont mean i want you looking average
I thought you known that, take you where your zone at
Peeps, in the street talkin like they own that
I talk truth, but they only want facts
When you wanna do right, you know where your homes at
I tell you wadel lennex, that mean wait a minute
Bracelet tennis, face then you finish
And just because you're not my girl
That doesnt mean you alone in this world
