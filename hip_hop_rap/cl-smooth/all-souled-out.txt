I want you
I need you
My soul is weak for you
And im trying to seek you
seek you, seek you,
Chorus
<
Cause I'm ALL SOULED OUT
and i say this without a doubt
You picked me up from the road
you have a soul of gold
ALL SOULED OUT, its just the way I feel
but give me time, and let me be, and I will heal.....
The Ocean bows to the palm trees, like I bow to you
There ain't nothing like singin out your soul
When the mist has cleared,and its all your goal
but, don't let me be the last to know
when, its over, over, over...........for your SOUL.
Chorus
<
Seeking rhythem on the shore
but my soul is already torn
Ive bled like ive battled with a thorn
Seeking MY,  seking YOUR SOUL
and after all this.......
Chorus
< 2X fade
