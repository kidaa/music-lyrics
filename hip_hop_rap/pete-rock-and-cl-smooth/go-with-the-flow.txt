Get on up
[ VERSE 1 ]
Yo 
From the intro 
I flow
3 in a row
Buildin like a Lego
Stacks upon stacks 
It attacks the wax
Scrub it like Ajax 
Relievin as a X-Lax
The night cap of rap 
Here to make another hit
To undercover, smudder 
Word to mother
Pump it for the playground
World renowned
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth is in town
I design a logical line
A mastermind, so recline 
And listen to what's mine
I'm untouchable, lovable
Some try to imitate, but you can't make a double of 
Me, the capital C, capital L, capital S
M-double o-t-h - yes 
A pro 
So you know
You gotta go with the flow
[ VERSE 2 ]
Smooth as ya ever gonna get to hear
Crisp and clear 
So step to the rear
And make room for daddy 
Bigger than a Caddy
To move a crowd? Hm, gladly
It's all done with ease 
Past MC's 
And all they feel is a breeze
The technician 
With the first division
Like a surgical incision
Deeper envision 
My flow the naked eye can't stare
But only hear 
Another poet like Shakespeare
C.L. the swinger, ringer, clinger
And oh yes, you know, another hum dinger
Wreckin any studio, love to make cash 
So kick it like judo
Big like a sumo
Rhymes like a pro
So you know 
Like a flute I blow
And go with the flow
[ VERSE 3 ]
I rock the microphone 
But you probably know to hype the show
I gotta go with the flow
And take it to another degree 
That many people wanna see
But above elementary
I made lyrical 
Any kind of material
More than minimal
For any individual
That I send 
To reach the end
And just like Clark Gable, it's 'gone with the wind'
And take flight 
Through the night 
Like a meteor, right insight 
To shine like a bright light
You gotta tip-toe 
From the get-go
Live in stereo, rhymes gotta flip, so
Pete Rock can move your butt 
And cut the strut
 *scratching*  Yeah what?
Just like a pro 
So you know
I'm ready and set 
To go with the flow
