Open, Sesame, steppin through the mist, it's the specialist
Comin to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standin in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearin
while my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateerin
Now appearin, Pete Rock and CL Smooth, to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out
[Pete Rock]
Check it out, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without _Anger in the Naion_
Yo, without _Mecca and the Soul Brother_
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You know we can't _Reminisce_
If we don't _Straighten It Out_
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
[CL Smooth]
Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street or beat
to keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like boomer, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'ma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
on attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about..
.. ";The Sun Won't Come Out";
[Pete Rock]
Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta _Act Like You Know_
_If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right_ kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You can't _Reminisce_ to _T.R.O.Y._
If we don't _Straighten It Out_
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
[CL Smooth]
I rule chicks off acoustics, watchin the Knicks
We up ten, but need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, and what I invent
a pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days so check it out
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
from the bassment, enterin the streets you meet
Pete Rock and CL Smooth and when you see what it's about
You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades
