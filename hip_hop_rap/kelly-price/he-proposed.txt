VERSE 1
IT WAS VALENTINES DAY FEBRUARY THE 14TH
MY BABY TOOK ME TO A SPECIAL PLACE
SAID HE HAD A SURPRISE FOR ME
HE TOLD ME TO CLOSE MY EYES
SO THAT I COULD NOT SEE AND WHEN I OPENED THEM UP
HE WAS ON ONE KNEE REACHIN' FOR MY HAND THAT'S WHEN
CHORUS
HE PROPOSED TO ME- HE PROPOSED WITH A DIAMOND RING
I STARTED CRYING- HE PLACED IT ON MY FINGER AND I SAID
YES- HE PROPOSED TO ME- HE PROPOSED WITH A DIAMOND
RING I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I LOOKED IN HIS EYES AND I
SAID YES.
VERSE 11
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT- IT WAS 8:43 PM TO BE
PRECISE
HE LOOKED INTO MY EYES AND SAID-YOU'VE MADE ME THE
HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE. SOON AS I GOT HOME I CALLED MY
MOTHER ON THE PHONE- SAID YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST
HAPPENED TO ME
BRIDGE
WE WILL BE TOGETHER-THIS I KNOW
WE WILL LOVE FOREVER MY HEART TOLD ME SO
IF YOU PROMISE TO HOLD ME TIGHT AND NEVER LET ME GO
WE'LL BE HUSBAND AND WIFE
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
