HOOK
HOW DOES IT FEEL
NOW THAT YOU KNOW
YOU COULD'VE HAD ME
BUT YOU LET ME GO
YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE 
OF YOUR OWN WORLD
CUZ SOMEONE ELSE MARRIED
MARRIED YOUR GIRL.
VERSE 1
DESTINY SAID WE WERE TO BE
BUT YOU TESTED FATE SO
YOU COULD RUN FREE.
NOW YOU WATCH IN DISBELIEF
WHILE SOMEONE ELSE IS LIVING YOUR LIFE WITH ME
BRIDGE
YOUR WIFE, YOUR KIDS, YOUR HOUSE, YOUR CARS
YOUR WHITE PICKET FENCE AROUND YOUR GREEN ACRED LAWN
WAS WRITTEN LONG BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
YOU GAVE IT AWAY, OH WHAT A MISTAKE!
VERSE 11
ALL ALONG YOU WASTED TIME
SCARED TO SETTLE DOWN AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND.
BUT WAS IT WORTH IT ALL?
TO DO YOUR DO?
TO SEE HIM WALKING EVERYDAY IN YOUR SHOES!
