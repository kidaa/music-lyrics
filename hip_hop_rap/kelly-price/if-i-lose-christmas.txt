Holiday season is coming our way
music and lights set the mood for the day.
There are so many things that I've gotta do
to make Christmas special for you.
Shopping and planning all things in their place
company's coming in just one more day.
My body is tired, there's so much to do
I can't wait till Christmas is through #38;#8230;..oh
Remember the Christmas candy dish I do
and sneaking to find your hidden gifts.
The carols I sung and the games I played
Oh when did it all go away
Remembering Santa's lullaby
The night before Christmas butterflies.
Does Christmas mean to you
what Christmas means to me?
Cause I don't wanna grow up
If I lose Christmas.
