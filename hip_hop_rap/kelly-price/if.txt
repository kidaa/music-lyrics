HOOK I
IF I COULD LOVE YOU
IF YOU HAD CAME INTO MY LIFE BEFORE
IF I COULD TURN AND WALK AWAY 
I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND
HOOK II 
IF I COULD KISS YOU 
IF I COULD HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS AWHILE
IF I COULD BE WITH YOU TONIGHT
I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND
VERSE I
BABY, BABY, BABY
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
WHATCHA DOING NOW
AND HOW YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN
AND NOW I SEE YOU BABY
CUZ YOU'RE BACK AGAIN
AND YOU WANNA KNOW
IF WE CAN KICK IT AGAIN?
BUT SO MUCH HAS CHANGED NOW
I GOTTA MAN AND SOME KIDS 
I'VE GOT RESPONSIBILITIES
SO I CAN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE
BUT I WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT
VERSE II
IT'S OUR SECRET BABY
IS WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE
MY HOME, MY FAMILY 
THE THOUGHT IS TEMPTING BABY
BUT I WON'T BE WEAK
CAN'T GO OUT LIKE THAT
NEVER, NO WAY, NO HOW NOT ME!

BRIDGE
ANOTHER LIFE, ANOTHER SPACE
ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE
BUT NOT RIGHT HERE AND NOW
I GOTTA HONOR MY SACRED VOWS
PASSIONS HIGH, DESIRE STRONG
IT'S FEELING RIGHT BUT THIS IS WRONG
AND I'M NOT THAT KINDA GIRL
I GOTTA GO HOME TO MY WORLD
