Love of my you are
Sunlight, my shining star    
All of the world to me
All I could ever need
Lately I can feel you've grown away from me
And inside I pray it's not too late to find a remedy

Don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna say goodbye
So how can I start again
And how will my heart mend
Here I am alone with only memories
So I'm searching just to find a way to keep you here with me

So I close my eyes
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream

Dreams that you're holding me
Dreams that won't ever be
Visions of loving you
Wanting to make them true
I find myself believing you'll come back to me
Cause I'm trying not to feel the pain, that loneliness can bring

So I close my eyes
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream

It's so hard to make it through the day without you
So I pray for night to dream you're here with me, with me

So I close my eyes 
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream
So lay me down and take me to a dream
