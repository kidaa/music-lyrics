VERSE 1
I FOUND A LOVE SO REAL
IT FILLS MY HEAD RIGHT DOWN TO MY HEELS
NEVER THOUGHT THAT I'D EVER FEEL THIS WAY 
MY LOVE PLEASE STAY
VERSE 1
MOVE MY CLOUDS AND GAVE ME THE SUN
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT YOU ARE THE ONE
MADE MY WORLD COMPLETE AND NOW I SEE HOW LOVE
SHOULD BE--- AND I LIKE
HOOK
LIKE HOW YOU MAKE ME FEEL
THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL
IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE REAL
VERSE 11
HAPPY DAYS CUZ NOW I HAVE YOU
PAIN ERASED I'M NO LONGER BLUE
FILLED MY EMPTY SPACE WITH LOVE SO TRUE
I NEVER KNEW I'M IN LOVE, I CAN'T DENY 
FOUND SOMEONE WHO MAKES ME SMILE
BUTTERFLIES INSIDE
THIS FEELS SO RIGHT
YOU'VE CHANGED MY LIFE
BRIDGE
EVERY SINGLE PART OF ME
LOVES EVERYTHING YOU DO TO ME
DON'T EVER GO AWAY
BABY, ALWAYS STAY 
BOY YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE 
I LIKE THE THINGS YOU DO
