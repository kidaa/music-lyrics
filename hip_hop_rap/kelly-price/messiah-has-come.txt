I have heard a message from the Lord.
He's revealing His purpose to me.
A virgin had a son, the Lamb of God, the holy one
Messiah has come.
Oh the joy that came to earth below yes it did
on that night the world was soon to know
Laying in the hay was born the King of Kings that day.
Messiah has come, Messiah has come.
And His name and His name
shall be Emanuel Emanuel
Holy one
God with us and man, oh
He will save His people from their sins
Messiah has come, Messiah is born, Messiah has come.
In a stall in Bethlehem,
manger born, there He lay
Lay one silent night.
Shepherds came to worship Him,
Angels sing to Him
born to save the world from sin, ooh 
Holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, God with us and man, Messiah
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
He's the Lord of Lords, Messiah
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus is His name, Messiah
