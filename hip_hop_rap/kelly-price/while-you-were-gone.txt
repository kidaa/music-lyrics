Hmm, whoa, yeah, oh baby, hmm, oh

I read you wrong
You said you'd only be away a while
But the days turned into weeks
And all the weeks into miles
Baby why?
You could've told me you were telling me goodbye
Could've come clean and let me walk away in style, oh

Funny thing is
While I was missing you
While I was figuring what I was gonna do

1 - I got wise, I got hip
I caught on to your tricks
I got over it real quick, yeah baby
While you were gone
Now I'm cool, can't you tell
Feel so good about myself
A funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone

Oh, you looked surprised
Like no one ever left you and survived, no
Well leaving me alone has kind of opened my eyes
Baby you, you gave me the time to find somebody new
And I found strength inside me I never knew, oh

Funny thing is
While he was holding me
While he was showing me how it's suppose to be

Repeat 1

Repeat 1 with ad-libs by Kelly

Didn't freak, didn't cry
I just held my head up high
I learned how to say goodbye
While you were gone
Had time on my hands
Baby don't you understand
A funny thing happened to me baby
While you were gone

Had nothing but time on my hands
Learned how to understand boy
Got over you, got over you, oh
While he was holding me
While he was showing me how it's suppose to be
Oh baby

Repeat 1

While you were gone, oh
Learned to lie, learned a lesson
Learned how to get along, learned how to be strong
Learned how to love myself, while you were gone, ooh, oh
