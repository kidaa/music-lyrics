VERSE I
SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
SO SHE GOT TO STEPPIN' OUT THE DOOR
SO MANY YEARS YOU BEAT HER DOWN
NOW YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE
BETTER STRAIGHTEN UP
THERE'S A NEW GIRL IN TOWN
HOOK
I LIVE HERE NOW
THE OTHER WOMAN HAD TO LEAVE
CUZ SHE WAS TRIPPIN'
NOW THE RIGHT ONE HAS YOUR KEYS
I LIVE HERE NOW
AND I'LL NEVER TAKE FROM YOU THE THINGS SHE TOOK
THAT JUST WON'T DO
VERSE II
SO MANY YEARS SHE LIVED FOR YOU
SO MANY TEARS SHE CRIED THEM TOO SHE WET THE PILLOW
SO MANY MEMORIES THAT WON'T ERASE YES
BUT SHE'S NEVER COMIN' BACK 
DON'T YOU LOOK FOR HER 
CUZ I'VE TAKEN HER PLACE
BRIDGE
I CAN'T BE THAT WOMAN WHO LET YOU BREAK HER DOWN
I CAN'T BE THAT WOMAN WHO LET YOU MAKE HER FROWN
CUZ NOW I SEE THAT I DESERVE BETTER THAN YOU'VE GIVEN ME
AND MORE I DESERVE MORE, I DESERVE MORE!
