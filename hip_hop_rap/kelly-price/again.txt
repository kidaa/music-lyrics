Verse I
Sorry I never meant to hurt you
You know I really love you
And if you give me one more chance I'll prove it to you
Stop! Cuz I don't wanna hear it
Please don't say your same old speech
Another time, I think I have it memorized

Hook
Again, boy lied to me
Again, and you're hurting me again
I've made up my mind and I won't take you back this time
Again, don't start calling me
again, no apologies again
I won't change my mind
I won't take you back this time

Verse II
I'm sorry, those words for you are easy
You think that they appease me but I know now
They're just two words you use to play me
Stop! Cuz I will not believe it
This time I'm leaving all the hurt and pain behind
So I can just be happy once again

Bridge
Happy once again
This time I will find someone to love me
And find someone to really be my friend
Happy once again
Never will I let another hurt me
Like you hurt me so, again
