12  Extended Version 

[Cha Cha]
Cha Cha, ah
I got you heated in the 400
A slow moment with a payback, sure want it
Ain't gon' run it 'till I gain the feathers gon' wit it
Ain't gonna split it 'till you thinkin' that you gon' hit it
But don't get it, try to kick it in again
Maybe then you tryin' to win
Bishop blaze the track and I just made you get hot again
Ain't it amazin', noon-time hotter than Cajun
All occasions, Absolute's absolutely blazin'

[Kelly Price]
1 -     I feel your heat
    When your body's close to mine
    When you look into my eyes
    Even when you're on my mind
    Baby, I feel
    I feel your heat
    When you're laying next to me
    Baby, when I hear you speak
    Even when I feel the need
    And you're not around

[Absolute]
Temperature been rising
Girl, it's not surprising
Really got me going with your sexual thing

Emotions I am feeling
I need your body's healing
To touch me if you wanna
Girl, you're blowin' my mind

Repeat 1

Baby don't you wanna
Cuz I really wanna
Feel your body swinging while we're doin' our thing
The heat has got me sizzlin'
The sweat has got you glistenin'
The rhythm's got you movin' to the sound of 
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Repeat 1

[Cha Cha]
So hot I make ya sizzle when I go one-ten it
We'll just floss a little
Pop the cork and let it fizz a little
Hope to get a little, after we gig' a little
But then we're playa's for years and still they hit the middle
Adrenaline pumpin' for somthin' in the heat of the moment
I see that you want it, play hard to get
To keep it from owing it up to yabyum
You have plenty, not to condone it
It's a difference in makin' me heated and makin' me want it

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[K.Price]
I feel your heat
[Absolute]
I get so hot I just can't believe
How I feel when you're next to me
It's impossible not to see
So baby tell me, can you feel the heat?

[K.Price]
I feel your heat
[Absolute]
I get so hot I just can't believe
How I feel when you're next to me
It's impossible not to see
So baby tell me, can you feel the heat?
