VERSE I
I'M READING YOUR  DEAR JOHN 
IT SAYS YOU'RE MOVING ON
YOU NEED YOUR SPACE, YOU NEED SOME TIME 
AND GREENER GRASS YOU SEEK TO FIND
I SAW IT FROM AFAR 
I KNEW IT IN MY HEART
THE HAPPINESS HAD GONE AWAY
PRETENDED WE WOULD BE OK
HOOK
FOR EVERY TIME YOU'VE MADE ME CRY
I GOTTA SIT AND WONDER WHY 
I LOVE YOU, I STILL DO
I NEED YOU, I ALWAYS WILL
I WANT YOU TO HOLD ME TIGHT
I NEED YOU WITH ME TONIGHT
I STILL DO
VERSE II
WHY DO I HOLD ON?
WHY CAN'T I BE STRONG?
I KNOW IT'S TIME TO WALK AWAY
BUT STILL INSIDE I HOPE AND PRAY 
THAT YOU'LL RETURN TO ME
MY EYES TOO BLIND TO SEE
THAT LOVE SHOULD NEVER BRING ME PAIN
I KNOW I CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY
BRIDGE
I GOTTA WIPE AWAY THE TEARS 
I GOTTA STAND AND FACE MY FEARS 
I GOTTA LOVE MYSELF ENOUGH TO MAKE IT BETTER
THE WOMAN THAT I USED TO BE
I KNOW SHE'S STILL INSIDE OF ME
I'LL FIND A WAY TO BREATHE AGAIN
THIS WON'T BE HOW MY STORY ENDS
