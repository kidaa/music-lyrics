LP Version

[Intro]
This is a test
This is only a test

Boy, do you know
What I'm feeling
I'm overwhelmed by your lovin'
I can't deny
That I want you all the time

But I gotta know 
What you're thinkin'
Hit it and run, real affection
Whatever it is
I won't let you waste my time
So how will I know

1 -     Baby with just a kiss
    Boy when you touch my lips
    Honey, I'll know for sure
    Boy, when my eyes meet yours
    And if your love is true
    I'll give to you my very best
    Just pass the test

Boy, when I love
It's completely
You'll do the same
If you want me
Can't be a fool
And just throw my heart away
But how will I know

How will I know 
What you're feelin' is real
When you say you love me
And how will I know 
If it's real 
What you feel when you say you care
Oh, we'll put it to the test

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

I've got a kiss on my lips
And it's wearing your name
So hold on, oh, here it comes
I really wanna know 
It's really gonna show
The way you feel inside
No where to hide

Repeat 1 until fade

Cause I'm so hot and I love to ball
To the yes, yes, y'all

Cuz I be touching myself like I was T-Boz
Niggaz scream my name, but you know it's all the same
Like a dream sequence, I'm caught up in the game
The M-i-s-s E make them scream
And I'm a sho''nough be the boss on this team so
So all you rap g'z gonna miss or make the green
Make the money, do what they say so
Even strip naked if it's bringing in the doe
To let you know, I'm better than niggaz say so
So if you hear them say that someone else is the best
Come and give me a kiss, and put it to the test
