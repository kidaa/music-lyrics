HOOK
SISTER YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT
MY SISTER YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEEP
CUZ THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER
VERSE I
A MOTHER WORRIES ABOUT THE SON SHE RAISED
ALONE CUZ HE IS FIGHTING WITH DANGER AND
IT'S GETTING CLOSE, BUT HE WON'T LISTEN
SHE PRAYS TO GOD AND ASKS HIM WOULD YOU PLEASE
PROTECT HIM BUT SHE IS NOT ALONE
VERSE II
A YOUNG GIRL'S LYING ABOUT THE WEIGHT SHE'S 
GAINING BECAUSE SHE IS HIDING A BABY
THAT HER BOYFRIEND SAYS HE DIDN'T FATHER
HE SAID HE WAS IN LOVE BUT NOW HE CAN'T
BE BOTHERED BUT KEEP YOUR HEAD UP HIGH
LITTLE SISTER
VERSE III
STRUGGLIN, TRYING, WORKING DAYS AND SCHOOL AT
NIGHT THE BILLS ARE PILING, PATIENCE LOW AND 
PRESSURES HIGH AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT. YOU SAY
YOU'LL JUST THROW UP YOUR HANDS BUT YOU CAN MAKE
IT. SOMEBODY UNDERSTANDS.

STRONG AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
YOU SHOULD SEE, YOU SHOULD KNOW
STRONG AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
SISTER, SISTER REPEAT
