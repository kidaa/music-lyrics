First time I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
Second time my momma replied
Said you gotta let him be a man
And third time I've had it with your lying
Cause sorry wouldn't work again
So I said three strikes
You're out no more, you're gone
Get gone keep walking out my door

Packed your bags while you were gone
They'll be waiting for you on the lawn
Changed the locks so keep your key
We don't need to talk
So no apologizes
I don't wanna feel
Like I'm going through time and time again
If I'm loving you
So just walk away leave me alone
This is for the best, so I'm moving on

One, two, three, four
You were messin' round
Were never really sure and
Four, three, two, one
You thought that it was game
And you could have some fun
One, two, three, four
Said I won't be a fool
Won't let you back in my door
Four, three, two, one
Cause playtime is over
You're through, I'm done

First time I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
Second time my momma replied
Said you gotta let him be a man
And third time I've had it with your lying
Cause sorry wouldn't work again
So I said three strikes
You're out no more, you're gone
Get gone keep walking out my door

Had me fooled loving you
Had me thinking 'bout spending life with you
So locked up in your tricky ways
Only thoughts of you had me in a daze
Then reality came and gave to me
What I needed most that was eyes to see
You would never change 
Everything was game
Counting all the times really blows my mind

One, two, three, four
Hmm you were messin' round
Were never really sure and
Four, three, two, one
You thought that it was game
And you could have some fun
One, two, three, four
I won't be a fooled
And won't let you in my door
Four, three, two, one
Cause playtime is over
You're through, I'm done

First time I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
Second time my momma replied
Said you gotta let him be a man
And third time I've had it with your lying
Cause sorry wouldn't work again
So I said three strikes
You're out no more, you're gone
Get gone keep walking out my door

I hoped, I prayed you would come around
See it my way
Now it's too late
No chances, go away, go away, hey first time...

First time I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
Second time my momma replied
Said you gotta let him be a man
And third time I've had it with your lying
Cause sorry wouldn't work again
So I said three strikes
You're out no more, you're gone
Get gone keep walking out my door
