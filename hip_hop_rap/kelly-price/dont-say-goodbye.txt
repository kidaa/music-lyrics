[Intro]
Oh, baby
I, I, I don't wanna say 
Don't wanna say 
Don't wanna say
Mmm, Hear me baby

1 -     Don't say goodbye
    I'll love you for my life time
    Without you there is no me
    Mmmm, don't say goodbye
    Cuz soon it will be all right
    Oh baby, can't you see

Baby, hold on
To what you know is real
We've had our share of problems
But they can't change the way I feel
We're gonna make it through the rough times 
Together, you and I
I've been loving you too long
So stay with me
Don't say goodbye

Repeaet 1

Baby hold on
It won't be very long
All these problems we've been through
They're making our love strong
We've gotta hang in there
In just a little while
For every tear we've cried
We will wear a smile
Don't say goodbye

Repeat 1

Cuz I know
I know that we can make it
If we only try
Don't worry 'bout a thing
You gotta believe me
This love was meant to be
Don't ever say goodbye
Goodbye
I promise to love you baby, please

Please stay with me baby
I don't wanna hear you say
Cuz I would go crazy
If you weren't with me
Please stay with me baby
I don't wanna hear you say
Cuz I would go crazy
If you weren't with me
And baby can't you see

Repeat 1 until fade
