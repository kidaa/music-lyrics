VERSE I
I'M WAITING AT THE DOOR 
WITH JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN
A BIRTHDAY SUIT AND A SMILE JUST FOR YOU.
SEE I BEEN THINKING ALL DAY BOY 
OF BRAND NEW WAYS TO SAY BOY
THIS THING THAT'S ON MY MIND
SO I'LL JUST TAKE MY TIME AND SAY
HOOK
SO SWEET TO ME BABY
IT FEELS GOOD TO ME HONEY
HEAVEN SENT MY SOULMATE FOR SURE
LOVE WAS NEVER LIKE THIS BEFORE
VERSE II
THOUGHTS OF THINGS YOU DO
KEEP ME WANTING YOU MORE
YOUR TENDER KISS
LORD KNOWS I CAN'T RESIST
YOU'RE SO MUCH MAN
AND I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT JUST ONE WORD FROM YOUR MOUTH
AND I'LL BE MELTING IN YOUR HANDS
BRIDGE
WHEN YOU'RE IN MY ROOM 
AND I'M LOOKING AT YOU
I WANNA DO I WANNA DO THINGS
SO LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
LOOK IN MY EYES 
AND I'LL COME ALIVE
YOU GOT MY FIVE SENSES 
ALL WOKE UP
I SEE YOUR PASSION
I FEEL YOUR TOUCH
I HEAR YOUR VOICE
I TASTE YOUR LOVE 
I'M BREATHING IN THE SCENT OF US
VERSE III
I'M WAITING AT THE DOOR
CUZ I WANT A LITTLE MORE LOVE
YOU GIVE TO ME 
CUZ BOY IT'S MIGHTY SWEET YOU'RE SO...
