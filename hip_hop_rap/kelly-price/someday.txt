LIVING WASN'T EASY
CUZ WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY
BUT I KNEW I WOULD MAKE IT SOMEDAY.
THEY TOLD ME I WAS NOTHING
THAT I'D NEVER BE SOMETHING
BUT I KNEW I WOULD MAKE IT SOMEDAY
VERSE 1
THIS IS MY STORY, I WAS A GIRL WHO
CAME FROM NOTHING, LIFE IN MY SURROUNDINGS
WAS BAD. BUT DEEP INSIDE ME
I WOULD PRAY FOR GOD TO GUIDE ME
CUZ I KNEW HE'D GIVE ME STRENGTH FOR LIFE
AND ALL IT'S PROBLEMS BACK THEN.
VERSE 11
HAND ME DOWN CLOTHING 
EMPTY SHELVES INSIDE THE CUPBOARD
AND MAMA KEPT THREE JOBS TO MAKE DO
I'D HEAR HER CRYIN
BUT SHE NEVER STOPPED BETWEEN
3 GIRLS, LIGHT BILL  #38; THE RENT YA'LL
LIVIN WASN'T EASY BACK THEN
BRIDGE
OH OH OH OH OH OH-----------------------------BACKGROUNDS
BY FAITH I BELIEVED ONE DAY I'D
SING, THINGS WOULD GET BETTER
SO DON'T GIVE UP NO MATTER WHAT IT SEEMS
MODULATE
HOOK 11
LIVIN WASN'T EASY 
CUZ WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY
BUT I KNEW I WOULD MAKE IT SOMEDAY
NO MATTER WHAT IT'S SEEMING
YOU GOTTA KEEP ON DREAMIN
AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT SOMEDAY
