He knows I'm here though
Oh God

How'd you get here so fast anyway?
What'd you do, fly?

Listen, I didn't come here to argue
I didn't come here to fuss or fight 
I came here to make things right
I want you to know that I understand what I did
And I wanna make things better between me and you
[Kelly] How you figure you can do that?
[Shawn] Well, I can start by saying that I love you
I mean, ah......
