Mmm, ain't no way
For me to love you
If you don't let me
Oh no, no, no
And ain't no way
For me to give you all you need
If I can't give all of me

I know the way ain't easy
But I'm giving you my hand yes I am
Oh that's just the way, the way it was planned
But how can I, how can I, how can I give you
All I have
If you're tyin' both of my hands

Ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way
Ain't no way, ain't no way
For me to love you
I can't love you if you don't let me

Oh oh oh oh oh
Stop tryin' to be something you're not
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Faithful is the man who gives everything
Everything from his heart
And if you need me
If you need me like you say you do
Oh, baby you got to know that I'm here for you

Ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way
You got to know this
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no way I can
No way, no way, no way, ohhh
For me to love you, no no no no
If you don't let me

I really wanna love you, yes I do
But first you've gotta let me, yeah
Mmmm
You gotta, you gotta let me
No way I can love you, no no no no
Mmmm
You gotta let me, oh ohh
