Hello
It's after nine o'clock you should be in bed already
I miss you
I love you baby

I hear you calling for me
Sometimes you cry in your sleep
Cause you don't understand why
I can't be with you tonight

But baby close your eyes
And try to sleep for awhile
You'll hold the pillow tonight
But soon I'll be by your side

I know you wonder if I
Know how you're feeling inside
So many things on your mind
Too much to think for a child

But baby close your eyes 
Close your eyes
And try to sleep for awhile
Oh
I know you want me right now
But I'll be home tomorrow

[Jonia   Jeff Jr.]
I know you said not to worry
Cause you'll be home in a hurry
But I just wanted to tell you
How much I really do miss you

[Kelly]
Let me tell you, you're always 
On my mind, on my mind

[Jonia   Jeff Jr.]
I hear you calling for me

[Kelly]
Sometimes I cry in my sleep
Although I understand why
I can't be with you tonight, oh

So I'll just close my eyes
I'll try to sleep for awhile, hmm
I hold my pillow real tight, baby, baby
Cause soon I'll be by your side

Cause I love you
I'm gonna try not to worry
Really miss you
I'm coming home in a hurry
Coming home soon
But I just wanted to tell you
Gonna hold you
How much I really do miss you

So baby close your eyes
And try to sleep for awhile
You'll hold your pillow tonight
But soon I'll be by your side

So baby close your eyes
And try to sleep for awhile
You'll hold your pillow tonight
But soon I'll be by your side
