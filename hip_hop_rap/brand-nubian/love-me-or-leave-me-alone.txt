Aiyyo Jamar I got a girl that's bad!  uh-huh
But she don't understand my ways.. why's that
Arguin days after days after days..

[Lord Jamar]
Well I can dig it
See I done had some fly ones
But they try to get just that, thought I'd like to chase the cat
But I'm not a Dog, God is who you're lookin at
Couldn'ta tooken that, bullcrap, you woulda caught a jack

[Sadat X]
I told her,  quot;Yo the first thing is when the telephone rings
It ain't really nuthin but noise quot;
You wanna flip and lose your poise

[Lord Jamar]
Now they quick to flip, but yo honey get a grip
You gotta understand I'm a man with needs that needs fulfilling
And if you ain't with it somebody else is willing
You gotta love me, or leave me alone

	You gotta love me, or leave me alone
	You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*

[Sadat X]
I got this good thing girl, it's the righteous love
Not that quick on the top, one shop hop
I'll make your knees get wet in the places I'll pet
I'll make you breathe, faster than you can believe
Within your hole I'll use my control
And the final burst, I'll hold
*reggae chat* until it comes
Backscratches added up in sums
Didn't your momma teach you bout bonin a man
Bent my dick so bad that I ran
Now I'll, freak of the week, or ride the quest of a yardgirl's hips
Your pussy can't see these lips
I keep my tongue in my mouth.. cause I can't see down South
Vulgar  Maybe, obscene with the purpose
Sayin,  quot;I'ma do my own thing, bein I'm my own King..
and it's up to you to follow quot;
So on your Wisdom I'll shine my light
Bring forth the seed, created in the night

	You gotta love me, or leave me alone
	You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*

[Lord Jamar]
The degree, love hella right, get it right
Either all the above, or it ain't true love
I ain't down for a honey who don't wanna submit
Always throwin a fit, wanna talk a lot of shit
but love to get hit from behind
Gettin crazy joy from my Lazy-Boy that reclines
Seems the only time we're not in a fight..
is when I'm layin the pipe..
You don't want me to bone another chick
Quick to claim my name and my dick
But when I tell you get off the swine and get refined
You act like you're blind and you lost your damn mind
See I'm not the kind to let a woman run it
How my man Rick say it  _I Shouldn't Have Done It_
is what I'd be saying if you was runnin the show
No hoe, there's no gold, the G-O-D know
the time on the Sun and the Moon and the Stars
Dance to the tune of Lord Jamar
And if you're actin tone def it's your own mental death
Huh, you gotta love me, or leave me alone

	You gotta love me, or leave me alone
	You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*
