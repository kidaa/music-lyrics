So we could walk through the ghetto, politic all night
Start to make our own tracks, for these cats to recite
Recite, we'll put your juggalo veins right out your throat
Take these cats on from Brooklyn
I'm holdin it down with my throat
Heard me walk about it, Islamic and knowledge
Shinin bright like a diamond
Sittin in BK, rhymin
Holdin it down, waitin for the sun to set down
Look in the sky, see my man B.I.G. floatin around
One day the shine so bright
Livin life so light
Lost my man tonight
Settin it off, aight?
Check it like this
It got to go with the flow
Some niggas may not understand, but you know how it go
