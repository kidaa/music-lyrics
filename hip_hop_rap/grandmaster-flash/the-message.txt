                            Broken glass everywhere 
                            People pissing on the stairs, you know they just 
don't care 
                            I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise 
                            Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice 
                            Rats in the front room, roaches in the back 
                            Junkie's in the alley with a baseball bat 
                            I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far 
                            Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car 
                            Chorus: 
                            Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge 
                            I'm trying not to lose my head 
                            It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder 
                            How I keep from going under 
                            Standing on the front stoop, hangin' out the window 
                            Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes 
blow 
                            Crazy lady, livin' in a bag 
                            Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag 
                            Search and test a tango, skips the life and then go 
                            To search a prince to see the last of senses 
                            Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps 
                            So she can tell the stories to the girls back home 
                            She went to the city and got so so so ditty 
                            She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her 
own 
                            Chorus: 
                            It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder 
                            How I keep from goin' under 
                            My brother's doing fast on my mother's T.V. 
                            Says she watches to much, is just not healthy 
                            All my children in the daytime, Dallas at night 
                            Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight 
                            Bill collectors they ring my phone 
                            And scare my wife when I'm not home 
                            Got a bum education, double-digit inflation 
                            Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike 
at the station 
                            Me on King Kong standin' on my back 
                            Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac 
                            Midrange, migraine, cancered membrane 
                            Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might 
hijack a plane! 
                            Chorus: 
                            My son said daddy I don't wanna go to school 
                            Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a 
fool 
                            And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be 
cheaper 
                            If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper 
                            I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet 
                            Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps 
                            Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing 
funny 
                            You got to have a con in this land of milk and 
honey 
                            They push that girl in front of a train 
                            Took her to a doctor, sowed the arm on again 
                            Stabbed that man, right in his heart 
                            Gave him a transplant before a brand new start 
                            I can't walk through the park, cause it's crazy 
after the dark 
                            Keep my hand on the gun, cause they got me on the 
run 
                            I feel like an outlaw, broke my last fast jaw 
                            Hear them say you want some more, livin' on a 
seesaw 
                            Chorus: 
                            A child was born, with no state of mind 
                            Blind to the ways of mankind 
                            God is smiling on you but he's frowning too 
                            Cause only god knows what you go through 
                            You grow in the ghetto, living second rate 
                            And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate 
                            The places you play and where you stay 
                            Looks like one great big alley way 
                            You'll admire all the number book takers 
                            thugs, pimps, pushers and the big money makers 
                            Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens 
                            And you wanna grow up to be just like them 
                            Smugglers, scrambles, burglars, gamblers 
                            Pickpockets, peddlers and even pan-handlers 
                            You say I'm cool, I'm no fool 
                            But then you wind up dropping out of high school 
                            Now you're unemployed, all null 'n' void 
                            Walking around like you're pretty boy Floyd 
                            Turned stickup kid, look what you done did 
                            Got send up for a eight year bid 
                            Now your man is took and you're a May tag 
                            Spend the next two years as an undercover fag 
                            Being used and abused, and served like hell 
                            Till one day you was find hung dead in a cell 
                            It was plain to see that your life was lost 
                            You was cold and your body swung back and forth 
                            But now your eyes sing the sad sad song 
                            Of how you lived so fast and died so young 
                            Chorus:
