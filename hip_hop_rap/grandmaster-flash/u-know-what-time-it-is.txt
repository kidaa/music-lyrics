Music: J.Saddler Lyrics: L.Dukes, G.Williams - From the Grandmaster Flash Album ";Ba-Dop-Boom-Bang"; Elektra '87 
Just Get Off The Wall, Let's Have A ball 
The 70's are gone, it's the 80's y'all 
Grab a fly girl by the hand and ask her to dance 
C'mon Fellas don't be shy, just take a chance 
You'll never know it might lead to romance 
cause the beat is cold stompin', it'll put you in a trance 
you're so hypnotized that you stop and stare 
i'm steppin out of this cuase i'm not with that there! 
get on the dancefloor c'mon take a stand 
all the girlies in the place wanna dance with you my man 
get on the floor and work it out if you can 
here's my Ulterior motive, I mean my game plan 
it doesn't hurt to flirt, just go ahead and chase the skirt 
you can't help it, it's your line of work 
To get women on the floor 
it's you they adore, you might as well 
Chorus: 
You Know What Time It Is 
Hang On party people cause here we go 
we're gonna cold take the party to another plateau 
but in order for us to achieve a new height 
we wanna hear flash cut the beat up, ain't that right 
while flash is choppin the mix like an ax on wood 
you gotta dance cuase the beat is finger lickin good 
throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud 
and if there's anything you want to say, say it loud 
i know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim 
and y'all are lettin me know we're cold blowin the rim 
that's right , you're being served, served with a smile 
and homeboy you don't like it, we can step in the aisle 
just show no shame, you know it's only right 
and if there's anything you want to get off, get it off tonight 
Chorus 
A simple puch of the fade, a little flex of the wrist 
flash whoopin the mix while I'm kickin the gift 
yo like a double edge razor, the boy is nice 
when he cuts, give him room, or you might get sliced 
he's too cold to hold, to hot to be stopped 
this jam that we got is good to the last drop 
weather you like it or not, we rock 
yo since the day we emerged, have you heard 
that it was all about a party and yo' this is word 
this party's rated NS for no suckers allowed 
that's the scoop, hear me troop 
so don't you come here actin' wild 
but as you know there's always one in the crowd 
you wanna party, then act like you know, can you dig it 
and if you came to get Ill, Forget it, I ain't with it 
Chorus
