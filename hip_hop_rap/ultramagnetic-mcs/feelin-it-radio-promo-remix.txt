[C.Gee] Yo, party people, we're the Ultramagnetic MC's
	And since you felt us once, and it felt so good
	We had to do it again.. HOW?
	It goes somethin..
	like..
	THIS!!!

[Kool Keith]
Connecting the word, to express definition
Defined by wisdom, accordingly
I'll aim to burn, as others learn
The basic steps, like a child to me
You're just a newborn
Tryin to rhyme like me
but you wannabe, such a replica
All copycats, new jacks, your butt I'll wax
cause I'm tellin you
Like the rhymes you bought, I'm sellin you
For a million bucks, you bought em
But another sucker duck, I just caught him
like a stool pigeon, tryin to be the wizard

Now you're a parasite, a known pesticide
Filthy, and very dirty to me
And I agree hah, indubitably
Biologically, that you're irrelevant
I'm intelligent, a fool to insist
stupidity, behind your brain cells
Cause you're a roach, and I'm your D-Con
Evaporating, dissolving, eating germs
It's my turn, YOU MUST BURN, cause I'm speaking
Connecting every word, so smoothly
calm as I teach, so have a seat don't cheat
or else, you'll regret your punishment
And I, will excel with momentum
which is parallel, to the words
of, Ultramagnetic, Ced Gee!
