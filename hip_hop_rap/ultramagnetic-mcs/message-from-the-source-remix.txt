[Kool Keith]
You wanna know my business?  I got things to do
People to meet, people to see
Very important - matters to turn to
A waste of time for me to try to burn you
and talk a minute, you're not worth a conversation
I speak intelligently, with information
Goin and flowin and showin, you're still growin
adolescent -- with a childish mind
Your brain is small, plus it's hard to find
I need a microscope, to see a two-cent brain
that don't think, when they rob and steal
and rape and kill -- and murder their loved ones
Now put your brain in the guillotine
Slice up the cold cuts, you're goin nuts in a three-inch cell
You wanna low rate me?
You're better off in Hell, feel the flame
fire burn roast and toast
Let me heat up your skull, while I brag and boast
I keep your brain on stand-by
Cause this message, comin from the SOURCE!

Your attention please, come on and let me try this
This beat is funky -- so I just
made up some rhymes that are hyper than hyperspace
Ced Gee will kick bass face and eliminate
rappers who think quick slick with a few tricks
Can't be quick fixed if they try this
man, and, aiyyo, I have the right to be
on any stage and mic someone can pass to me
Cause, I'm in there, and I swear
I'm like Vladimir, no one best to
step to me, get to me, or pes-ter me
Confess to me, be guessin me
Adressin me, be less than me, or testin me
because, it only brings out the best in me
So, yo, here's what we really need to do
Instead of battlin we need to really improve
our race, and every other race
Bring em together -- and let's face
the problems, that we need to be solvin
People are dyin, starvin, robbin
Bein discriminated from different jobs
and things like that so think about that
We have a tool to use that they call rap
So, yo, let's use it, and not abuse it
And in the long run, we have improved this
situation and turned into a positive
They doubted this, but we're proud of this
institution we invented of course
And this message, is comin from the SOURCE!

Once again, I hear your garbage on my radio
Left to right, and comin through my stereo
I turn it off, go off, bug out, show
