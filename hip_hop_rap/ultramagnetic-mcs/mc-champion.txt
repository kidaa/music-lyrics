And now..
	You're MC Champions, Ultra-Magnetic

";I am sealing off the dimensional window
 Closing the hole in the fabric of the cosmos like a scar";

[Ced Gee]
Ahh yeah
One two, one two
This is agent Ble-Ced Gee
Ultramagnetic's in full effect
We in here droppin freestyle rhymes like MC Champions
So Keith, take it away

[Kool Keith]
Power compactor, brain distractor
Droppin a bomb, right in your anal connector
Sector, vector, the lyric inspector
X-Ray vision, powerful spector
Lexor, Mechtor, Egor
Ah yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
The rhythm I drop to hit the top to make your swing go pop
as I flow, pick up the micro'
Poem get hypo, tension as original
lyrical miracle, back to attack one
Black one, white one, green one or blue one
Colorful sweet rhymes, I'm back to do one
or two of you, three of you, or four of you
Five or six or seven, eleven of you
Wack MC's get back in the last line
And wait on the mic, you think I'm ready to pass mine
Up in the Brougham, with clever ability
I know when to sting a brain, just like I'm a killer bee
Hittin em hard with the rhyme as the flame throw
Hardcore, softcore, and even the rainbow
Polka-dot MC's, African, Indians
Spanish-American, mixed with Panamanian
Arabian Nubian, speak in Siberian
Japanese Chinese, and regular MC's
Preachers, teachers, and negative creatures
I roll and kick a rhyme, you grab your mic back
Sidewind and rattle like a snake I strike back
I chew your brain and, the monkey behind you
Your company management, the dummy who signed you
To pick up the slack but the hype ain't sellin many
records and tapes cause your rap ain't tellin any
metaphor phrases, things that amazes
me the next man, no biter or innovator
with lyrical instinct, you look like a duplicator
Bitin my style, nibblin on the big jock
With rhymes so tight, they keep your brain in the headlock
Count the one two three four five
I'm like like pushwagons, tag-teamin your dome
I'm just a CHAMPION

[Ced Gee]
Ah yeah, yo Keith, bust this
I got some freestyle rhymes too
I'ma warm up, then I'ma get deep
Bust it, check this out
Yo
Poetic genius, kickin metaphors
Ced Gee is the big boss, makin it better for
a pile of them, MC's again, I'm raggin them
So listen up my friend
I'm rappin the manifest, leapin some blind guess
The type of hype I select, when I rap come correct
My mic is on, and it's loaded, and it's lethal
Here's a dose, a taste of my potential
My super menu wind you bend you sends you
to watch a brother like me, continue
out on the warpath, flashback, sit back
Kick back with that, dope rap attack
Those that can't rap, with that weak rap
Need to get back, and just to add to that
fact, with words from the knowledge tip
My rhymes are swift, I have the gift
Like hocus-pocus, Ced Gee, and I'm still on
The mic is loaded with rhymes that flame on
Now you know just what I am creatin
We call it megafunk, a plan stated
I'm verbally passin, rhymes are outlastin
Waxin to smashin and kickin more ass and
with intensity, Ced Gee has got to be
schoolin a wannabe, rappers who try to be
like me, C-E-D
To flow on the mic and show no mercy
I'm a champion, I'm undefeated
My rep is strong, no hype is ever needed
To grow and grow, to grow and grow
To grow and grow, and grow and grow
To grow and grow, and grow and grow
Rap taller than Buckwheat's afro,
I'm a champion
