[Intro]
Come on
Wooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I never felt this way before
And she's all that I needed more
Her hips always belongs to me
It often makes me write on my dreams
If I knew there was only nine
She's still might be around because

[Chorus]
I I can't go on
Oh No
I tell you what am I gonna do now Hey
Without her
My life just won't it won't be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now Hey
Without
Woooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy

[Verse 2: Nelly]
I never thought that I would be
So caught up I wouldnt see
Just who would go to war for me
And take out two or three so easily
I give up everything to see if I found you baby girl
Cause it don't mean shit without you cause

[Chorus {*while talking in the background*}]
I I can't go on
Oh no
I tell you what am I gonna do now Hey
Without her without
My life just won't it won't be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now Hey
Without
Woooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy

[Verse 3: Nelly]
I gave her everything she ever needed
That why it shocked me when she said she was leavin
I wanted to find out what was going cause
I'm thinkin to myself miss something wrong
Smokin one day it hit me kinda fast
That I needed to check my stash

[*talking in the background*]

[Chorus]
I I can't go on
Oh no

Without her without her
My life just won't it won't be the same
