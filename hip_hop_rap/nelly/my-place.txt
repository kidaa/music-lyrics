[Nelly]
I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that, anything I'm offering
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's all his fault again that's what you tellin all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, i just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for ya

Hook: [Nelly]
When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Chorus: [Jaheim]
Won't you come on and go with me oh girl
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
and let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way our way

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time
We never had a problem with gettin it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one
Now check it I know you get excited Still
when I come around and bite it gurl
Quit frownin up and quit actin like you don't like it

I like it I know you like it, I like it You really like it,
I really, really like it, yeah yeah yeah  i want it, adore it,
so come let me enjoy it

Bridge: [Nelly]
Shawty where you been
Feels like a long time, long long time since I seen ya
Yes it has girl, and I know I said some Fucked up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
I didn't mean one single word
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word and more fo sho'
If I thought that you believe it
Cause you make my life so convinient for me
