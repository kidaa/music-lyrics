Put on your best clothes
We've been waiting too long for this moment
I'll put on my best smile
I'm shining inside and I'm proud of our love but
Everytime I turn around you say that you're not checking for love in that way
But everytime I come around you seem
So ready for this

Showtime our love's coming out
Lights camera action show what we're about cuz it's
Showtime our love's breaking out
Let's show the world you're my boy
I'm your girl cuz it's
Showtime our love's coming out
Lights camera action let it all hang out
Cuz it's showtime
Yeah our time is now
Let's show the world you're my boy
I'm your girl

Let's break a leg out there
This could be the start of the rest of our lives
I've got so much to share
And I'm ready to put it all out there for you
But everytime I turn around you seem
So afraid of what people might say
But can't you see it's a game they play
Trying to cast a shadow on our love

I wanna love you when I want
Want to love you where I want to
Wanna touch you when I wanna
Wanna kiss you when I wanna baby

Because it's not fair to love you in chains
It's not fair to love you in chains
