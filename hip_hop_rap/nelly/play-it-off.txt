[Chorus: Nelly]
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Your girl ain't gotta know I hit ya last night
I was all over your body goin ba-da-buh-da
Dame be such a hottie
Yo she's lookin over here but she won't get it out me y'all
Shake it off, that's how you play it off
Shake it off, that's how you play it off
Not now, no you can't take it off
But play it off, she won't know a damn thing

[Nelly]
I play it off 'til it's played out
I had her motherfuckin ass on the couch, kinda laid out
She hittin them {?} gettin ate out
I know I'm spaced out yeah but the shit sound way out
So I had to take a playa out, switch up my whereabouts
Cause she was tryin to turn a playa out
And plus she know a nigga blazed out
And lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out
She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached
That ba-da-buh-da
But it keeps, on, bringin me back

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
The Sun sick a triflin, so sick he have ya snifflin
Plus the chains like the nigga Slick Rick an' them
We had pick of them, strictly all dimensions and
Not to mentionin the Benjamins is thickenin
And now it's like a odyssey when she sayin hi to me
She eat the dick, then she cry when she gotta leave
Bye, bye, you gotta go now yeah
My girl, just, pulled up outside
She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached
That ba-da-buh-da
But it keeps, on, bringin me back

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Just know the whole hood is lookin at you
So don't let your girl catch you
So have your story right, on how we met
Just have your story right, and don't never forget
You need your story right, cause she'll be upset
Her inner feelings'll be disrespect, but
She said she loves that stroke
Keep on her heels and her coat
Then she say she loves my moves
And the way I do, what I do
She got that ba-da-buh-da
Gotta make, sure, I don't get attached
That ba-da-buh-da
But it keeps, on, bringin me back

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Story right 
Just know the whole hood is lookin at you
Story right
So don't let your girl catch you
Story right
