[Verse 1: Nelly]
I just touched down at this LAX
I'm looking for these girls on this LAX
Trying to find them niggas with that LA best
Dodging them niggas with that LA Stress
See I'm a visitor I'm a LA guest
I got to be aware on how the LA dress
Cause if it comes down I might get LA stretched
I ain't trying to be a trophy on no LA desk
Some niggas walk up tossing LA sets
I guess this supposed to be some type of LA test
Better watch the girls with the LA chest
Alot of plastic in those LA breasts hahahaha
I hit the crenshaw where they LA stunt
Seen a lot of 64's and LA trucks
Seen a lot of girls with them LA butts
A lot of niggas with them dickies and chucks ya feel me

[Chorus x2: Nelly, Snoop Dogg]
Switch 1 switch 1 raise it up
Switch 2 switch 2 make the back end up
Switch 3 switch 3 work it side to side
Switch 4 switch 4 make it a ? ride
Ya heard me

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Yo I spend a lot of time on this LA coast
Out here trying to do the LA most
Showfer driven phantom like a LA ghost
In the back with a drink take a LA toast
I spend a lot of time in them LA heels
With them models actresses and them LA heels
To my lawyers office for a LA deal
Cut the check for some LA kneels
Now I'm off to roadao just to LA shop
Still getting dirty looks from some LA cops
You than thought since Rodney King LA stopped
When they burn the LA watts
I send a lot of love to my LA brothers
My latinos and my negroes in them LA colors
My blessings go out to those LA mothers
Know that nelly is an LA lover

[Chorus x2: Nelly, Snoop Dogg]
Switch 1 switch 1 raise it up
Switch 2 switch 2 make the back end up
Switch 3 switch 3 work it side to side
Switch 4 switch 4 make it a ? ride
Ya heard me

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
Guess who just stepped in the place the midwest
It's your OG homie Nate all day
My homie snoop and nelly La
And we all up in your face all day
Different questions everyday the midwest
I got my answer in my way all day
Yeah they all got something to say LA
From st. louis to La all day

[Chorus x2: Nelly, Snoop Dogg]
Switch 1 switch 1 raise it up
Switch 2 switch 2 make the back end up
Switch 3 switch 3 work it side to side
Switch 4 switch 4 make it a ? ride
Ya heard me
