[Chorus:]

See now you could be a lady or a bitch girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin like a lolli-pop waitin for the lick girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin at the switch girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick

[Murphy Lee]
So basically I'm a joke right
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When are you that shoes untied before you know it method
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's gettin hectic
Reckage is likea hoopty hittin shawns
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles twistin & pullin
I'm like shorty help me come on 
Help me please don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile...
so I take advantage
Kisses in gentle places tryin to get myself established
I'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe with no control
Concentrating on my every lick her every blow
Yo', I'm still cold but cooler than 2 below
And now I got that wrong in the past, you'll never know
IT'S ON
Put my penis in accurate, just relaxing it
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-sale

[CHORUS]

[ali]
Now comes first like the front porch and the polo shirts
Skirts there they are thats the one cause Im far
From Average Lane with that "What's your name" game
I'm stormin on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if can 
Watch me wrap like saran
All up in this shit now
You want me like a tan
Live in me like a van
In reverse that's the worst
Playa curse put up on me now
We spreadin on my hommies like a germ
Watch me turn into captain kill a hoe
Fill a hoe strong
Watch me last long like a penny broke many motels
i got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on foutons
Comin out like Key won
I feel like ceramic in a hammoc
God damn it
Thats my words
Oohs and Aahs Slurred like a verb
Someone acting like an ass like a metaphor
Now I'm headed for the highways 
Selling me by's sideways

[CHORUS]

[Verse 3]
I spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones
Just to get em restin at home, come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstone
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa y'know
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin a nigga like offalana swish
I ban ya from the smoke house church, who you think you fuckin with
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show grab hold then I let go
Flows split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, to hit any one of you niggas rattin
Spit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin 
Go make the announcment, spark more Dynamite than "Good Times"
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin, headboards you be grabbin
Got 'em bangin the walls so hard the neighbors callin

Asking you "What happened  What's goin on over there even
Sounds like you guys are goin crazzzzzzzyy.."
