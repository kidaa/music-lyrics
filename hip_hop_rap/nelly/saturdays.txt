Hot motel 
Stuffy incide
I know well
This eleven walls
Hot black tar
I tan my legs
Rest my heart 
And dream of the city

Magazine and diet coke
I'm not a joke
This is me
Damaged leg
Heavy cart
Plastic cups
Linen mart

Rock garden
Where i used to play
People stare
Part of their day
Coffee break
Lunch at noon
Pumpernickel steak
Green and orange room

Done my list
I make my way
To help my mother 
End her day 
Fresh cut grass
parking lot 
We roll on out 
We got a lot 

We're on our way
Roll the windows down 
And scream out loud
We're tired now

Take it home
Stop on the way
To the bakery
For some fruit and cake
Home i lay
After a shower clean
I hit my head
And i dream
