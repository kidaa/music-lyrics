People say I've gone crazy
That I'm not the same lady
People say my eyes are hazy
People say I'm acting shady
But I'd rather be your baby
Than sit around and do the same things
I am getting something out of it
I'm indebted to your goodness
And I could never get enough

Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go
Make me glow glow glow glow
How far can you go
You make me glow glow glow glow
Only you know how to make me
Glow glow glow glow
I wanna go and go and go and go

I don't know what you did
I don't know what you did
But I think that I may float away
I don't know what happened
I don't know where we went
But I think that I may die today
There's everybody else and then there's you
Baby why you gotta be so good
And tonight you're on fire
I'm gonna never get tired

I don't gotta tell you what to do cuz you're on it
I don't gotta let you in my world cuz you rock it
I don't gotta tell you what to do cuz you're on it
I don't gotta let you in my world cuz you rock it
You rock it you rock it
