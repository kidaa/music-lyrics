You got your ways enough of mine
It's taking up all of my time
We need you to adore me
Come sit and drink from a cup
Don't leave until you're filled up
You're tired of all your travelling

I don't need nothing at all
Nothing but your kiss
Nothing but your arms
I don't need nothing at all

But somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

I know I'm missing for a word
I'm not trying to say a thing
I'm trying to live in this moment
Count all the sins, what it says
Tell me how long it'll take
To unravel your body

I don't need nothing at all
Nothing but your touch
Nothing but your hand
I don't need nothing at all

But somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

I need somebody to love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love
