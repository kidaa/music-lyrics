[Chorus]
You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really dont You dont even know
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really dont It really really dont
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell

I think the time has come, for me to have some fun
I'm bout to peel back the top on y'all and let in the sun
What the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son
I went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one
I love my fans to death, until my last breath
Thats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left
No competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same
Do they walk of fame, and all that it can bring
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
Im poppin collars from California to D.C.
Im in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey
Im putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's
Im flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens
Im bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams
With anything that I want, if I dont I got the means

[Chorus]

You think you know me but you really dont know
Peep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho
And I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance,
I'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn
It feels good when errthing is okay
And its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way
And I could park in the mountains and i'll still get valet
Hop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's
Im feeling good its only right I deserve
To spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge
And any nigga trippin now I leave him right by the curb
And I dont go to sleep mama so good night and good word
Im on a mission and its sort a like a mystery
And I aint stopping til' I go down in history
Now who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho
The N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go

[Chorus]

You read the magazines, and heard I made a scene
Believe it or not, I swear I'm just a human being
Im doing human things, cuz only humans change
They label me a role model cuz i appeal to teens
It really ain't that strange, now that I think about it
I came up in the game, changed everything about it
Im feelin better then ever without that Lotto shit
I wait up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some shit
You dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips
We've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks
Donating money, the families called and be lying shit
They screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship
And bring it up that Mississipi, if you really wanna come than get me
Tell them niggaz that a, don't tempt me
Cuz I'll squeeze them shits til' empty
Throw shouts at nigga like frisbee
Who the juice How the hell you gonna pimp me
You niggaz must be kidding me, like you aint never seen a nigga P. Diddy

[Chorus x2]
