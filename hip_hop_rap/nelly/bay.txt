I was out in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some niggas in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some girls from the bay bay bay bay bay
Lot of fuckers in the bay bay bay bay bay
And they all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum

Hey yo I represent that dirty E and T all the way
But I'm a rip this shit up like I'm straight from the bay
But no it ain't this diggity one from back in the day
It's the diggity diggity dirty one you call him Nelly
Leanin' on his fella's with his cellular phone
You can tell that the St. Lou was his home
More mail than the rest of them rappers
'Cause they get more stompin' than the gappers
And that's why Ice click was it
First name St., last name Tex
Hair brothers in their name Murphy Key
Slow had a mass, Sidia Ali
Old school rap, call it cranberry
Up in the abyss where home 'eef all day
Orange juice mixed with the Tanguaray
Hey, what can I say

I was out in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some niggas in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some girls from the bay bay bay bay bay
Lot of fuckers in the bay bay bay bay bay
And they all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum

Who you think this is
This ain't short, this St. Louis
Goin' to the mat, ma, that's my biz
Life's too short baby catch my drift
I was cold not long ago
Nelly don't stop that rap
If you do it well enough
She just might bring it back
And I yelled out biatch
I go on and on
Baby girl skills on the level of porn
A freaky tail that I met out on tour
Mamma was there like lean on horn
Short then said I got a dirty mouth
Sometimes that might be true
Well I'm the CEO of dirty mayn
So I ain't tipping off you

I'm just out in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some niggas in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some girls from the bay bay bay bay bay
Lot of fuckers in the bay bay bay bay bay
And they all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum

I could bring 50, with a yellow A
Yeah I'm from the Lou but today I'm reppin' bay
With the yellow tape, he ain't gettin' far
Mirror in my pocket so I practice lookin' hot
And you don't want to be around when them boys pullin' out them thangs
All my nigga's is pimps man, they all carrying canes
I met this girl up in the club she told me call her Wassie
Red bone hip with a bangin' ass body
Now izza, na izza, should I say wha?
Think about it, no way
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
What's a crew name, Dirty ET mayn
I just want to know know
Tell me when to go go
Prices on the cavi, but I can get it low
Pocket full of fetty and sippin' that herokay
So just sprinkle with me

I was out in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some niggas in the bay bay bay bay bay
Met some girls from the bay bay bay bay bay
Lot of fuckers in the bay bay bay bay bay
And they all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all go dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get dum dum dum dum dum dum
