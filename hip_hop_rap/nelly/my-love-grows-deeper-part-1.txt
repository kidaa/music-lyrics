[Chorus:]
My love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
My love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
My love grows deeper every day, deep into the sea
But takes a little piece of me, a little piece of me

Oh it's so beautiful out and I can't see why we're not allowed to be
Up in the sky with the birds counting the flowers
Oh my powers have failed me again when I can't see beginning to end
And I try to test it again through the hours
I get so stuck on leaving but I guess I think I'll stay
I'll be hanging around here anyway
I get so stuck on leaving, hell I think I'll go
Cuz they don't want me around here, no, no

[Chorus]

Oh why can't I be green as the grass beneath my feet
As fresh as the dew hits the ground in the morning
And not yellow like bumble bees, please take me off my knees
Cuz I don't wanna be red forever
I get so stuck on leaving but I guess I think I'll stay
I'll be hanging around here anyway
I get so stuck on leaving so hell I think I'll go
Cuz they don't want me around here, no no

[Bridge:]
Traveling far, all up in the blue, traveling far, 
could not be born because of you
Traveling far, up in the blue, could not be born because of you, 
because of you you you you you you you
I get so stuck on leaving, I guess I think I'll stay
I'll be hanging around here anyway
I get so stuck on leaving, hell I think I'll go
You don't want me around here no more

I get so stuck on leaving, I get so stuck on leaving
I get so stuck on leaving, stuck on leaving
Stuck on leaving, I gotta go
You cut my wings long time ago
You cut my wings long time ago

[Chorus]
