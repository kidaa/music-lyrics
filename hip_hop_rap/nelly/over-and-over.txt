'cuz its all in my head
i think about it over and over again
i cant keep picturing you with him
and it hurts so bad

and i cant take it i cant shake itno


[Nelly]
i cant wait to see you
wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
that one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
and a shame that we gotta spend our time being mad about the same
things
over and over againabout the same thing
over and over again

[Nelly]

i remember the last breath you took right in front of me
when you said that you leave
i was to damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
but i see clearly now
and this choice i made keeps playin' in my head
over and over again
playin in my headover and over again

i cant keep picturing you with him
and it hurts so bad


yeahcuz its all in my head
i think about it over and over again
