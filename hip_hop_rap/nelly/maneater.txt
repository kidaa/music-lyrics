[Timbaland:]
Take it back, take it back...

[Verse 1]
Everybody look at me, me
I walk in the door you start screaming
Come on everybody whatchu here for?
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
I want to see you all on your knees
You either want to be with me, or 

CHORUS:
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
make you buy cars
make you cut cords
make you fall, fall in love
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, all of her love
She's a maneater
make you buy cars
make you cut cords
Wish you never ever met her at all

[Verse 2]
And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something she means it
Even if you never ever ever seen it
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come and jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because, she said she love you, love you long time
