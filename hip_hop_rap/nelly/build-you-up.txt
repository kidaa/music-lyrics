Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's in your eyes
I can see the weakness
You don't have to hide
I can take you under
Under my wing
cause your voice gives me a song
That i love to sing

Baby, they build you up
Only to tear you down
Don't give up
Baby don't believe it, baby don't believe it

Baby they build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it, baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing

You were just a child
Ready to explore
And everything you saw
Looked like an open door

A place you can remember
You'd love to go back
But you can't even comprehend
That it's all in the past

Baby they build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it, baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing

Baby they build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it, baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing

Put your heart in my hands and i won't hurt you
Put your heart in my hands
I promise not to

I'll lift you up, you'll fly away, I'll lift you up, lift you up
I'll never build you up, only to tear you down
Baby just believe it, baby just believe it, it's good for something
I'll never build you up, only to tear you down, oh it's good for nothing
And i love you the way you are
