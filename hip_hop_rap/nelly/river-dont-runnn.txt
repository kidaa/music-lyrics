[Chorus- Stephen Marley]
Walk down the river cuz the river don't run
Same thing make you laugh, make you cry
Thats why what goes around comes around my son
Walk down the river cuz the river don't run
Same thing make you laugh make you cry
I got them rocks, them yellow diamonds and that oooh ooh oh bling

[Nelly]
Man I got two twin cutles's interior gator
I call em' Now and Later cz they candy flavored
You see I drive one now and drive the other one later
Shit it's the new Fresh Prince and all Im missing is Jada hey
I got a hard drive all Im missing is data 
Please give my number to ya sister I been missing to date her
I hate to hate a hater
In fact I hate to hate
Hatein' is hatein' you should never hate congradulate
Look hurr my attitude is just that you may never know my mind
Or know just what Im thinkin' if I don't let you inside
Yeah inside my mental I know you ment well
Im out of time and out of training days like Denzel
Never the gangsta type, more lke a hustla mayne
I fucked the ones up out them playboy books and hustler
Honeys and ? tails
The King magazines, the maximas the eye candy ? in queens

[Chorus- Stephen Marley]

[Nelly]

Im a spit it till I really can't spit it no mo'
Nothin' changed cell phone still 314
No the dertty ain't movin nann East West coast
Im a Midwest swanger cuz they love me the most
Some of em' lie me humble, others like me to boast
Please, my whole life is off of bets and numbers
I take a G-4 land to that H2 Hummer
Leave a 745 in LA for the summer
Got the world wide cell to check the e-mail
Plus 41k plan in ATL got 8 females
I see em' all from 8 to 12
The only player who can ball without his ACL
Who may not be origional but still a dunn da da
Im gone take his beat and flip it, Im gone make it hotter
You go head and take the train and Im gone take the chopper
Im tired of niggas frontin like they top gun shockers this is

[Chorus- Stephen Marley]

[Stephen Marley]
Man come running over, just ta shine his light
Lets take a visit, sacred is the night
Wrong wishes be ware, now that I am here
Loardy,loardy,loardy,loardy,loardy
Loardy,loardy,loardy,loardy,loardy

[Murphy Lee]
Shoot, they thought a durrty wouldnt make it this far
Now Im supporting my family they likin who I are
Schoolboy hard worker they consider him a star
I guess thats why they look at us as if we from mars
Singa la ling I deal wit bars like a weight trainer
Hustlin' got me bigger like weight gainer
A once remainer, St.Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her 
Shoot, Im just that dude that kick bars for a living
Get rich and trick collect cars for a living
Houses on hills, wit great lakes in the back
Bowling alleys and basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn look at the leather in that old school Lac' 
Baby doo doo green, I wonder who al' do that
The orgional rude dude, considered to cool 
Probally know me from touching your booty at school Bling

[Chorus- Stephen Marley]
