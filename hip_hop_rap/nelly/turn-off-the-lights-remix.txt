[Intro Timbaland] 
It's kinda dark in here, I can't see you 
[4x]

I really really want you to see me, so baby don't turn off the lights girl 
[4x]

[Verse 1 Nelly] 
It's gettin so lonely inside this bed 
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead 
There's an aching inside my head 
It's telling me I'm better off alone 
But after midnight ooo morning will come 
And the day will see ooo if you will get some 

[Chorus Nelly Timbaland 
They say that girl ya know she act too tough, tough, tough 
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light 
Turn off the lights girl 
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough 
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light 
Turn off the lights girl 
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down 
Till' you see all my dreams 
Turn off the lights girl 
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems 
Turn off the lights girl 

[Verse 2 Nelly Timbaland] 
I looked above the other day Turn off the lights girl 
Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change Turn off the lights girl 
I live my life by the moon Turn off the lights girl 
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go 
But after midnight ooo morning will come 
And the day will see ooo if you're gonna get some 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 Nelly] 
I'm searching for things that I just cannot see Turn off the lights girl 
Why don't you don't you, don't you come and be with me 
I pretend to be cool with me, I wanna believe Girl 
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve 
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life 
Or is it love that I'm looking to find 
It's all in me, can't you see ,why can't you, why can't you see 
It's all in me yeaa 

[Verse 4 Ms. Jade] 
I've been through many things, I've seen a lot of faces 
A lota you bet they peeped, backed up by many cases 
It ain't my skin, it's my will, I'ma win 
Dry da wilts to the end, I don't break, fold or bend 
Then again ya'll them bad boy shooters in the streets 
Like scooters to my shakers and movers 
It's waitin' for the green, everything ain't what it seems 
A different scene, lames leavin' 'em with a V-8 gleam 
It ain't no magic, we live up in the real world 
Real deal, represent for my real girls 
I know it's lonely at the top and I might fall 
As for now follow the rules 
And turn them lights off 

[Outro Timbaland] 
I really really want you to see me, so baby don't turn off the lights girl 
[7x]

[Nelly]
Turn off the light, turn off the light 
[4x]
