[T.I:]
Ya'll already know what this is homeboy
No no no no no nigga
Fuck what you heard homeboy
Real niggas on deck
Goons is out nigga hey

[Verse 1: Nelly]
We do 100 on the highway
Switching lane after lane
If the po po come then let em
Ain't no stopping today
We brought them horses out tonight hey
Them big blocks dude
Cams chrome pipes hey
I know you hear em
Please, who in your hood would trade places with me
If I ain't what ya trying to be than why you hustling see
To be young black and rich
If that ain't the combination
Tell me when it switched
I need to know listen
Maybe the problem is your thinking to small
You niggas only wanna rap and that's all
Your only goal is to buy out the mall
I go and buy me a mall
You want the stuff for the summer
I'm gon buy me the fall
And hit the myspace lick yeaaah
You know how many hits myspace gets yeaaah
Man it's like I'm hurting feelings just by telling the truth
I'm hurting feelings in and out of this booth
Now listen

[Chorus:]
You see me sitting in the turning lane whooo
Yours big but mine bigger mane
You wanna brag about a lil change
You need to step up your game lil boy
You better Hold up [x6]
You better sit your ass down
Hold up [x6]
You better sit your ass down

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well pac I see these haters watching me
But I ain't tripping wen ya'll see there ain't no stopping me
Weigh in the millions
And I'm steady buying property
I got land come catch me you hit the lottery
Nigga so stop playing
Boy I ride what I want to and ye ain't know
See me buying what I want to
Walk out the store 100 thousand in my pocket
You can tell how Im walkin

Jus to keep these haters off me
Posted at the red light
On chrome drop top candy red type
454 a nigga want it better bring it on

Yeah better know it

No right now once i tell em go and get em boy
And lights out
Nigga I ain't playing with ya
Come any day I'll hit ya
Don't let me pull up on ya in that turning lane nigga

[Chorus:]
You see me sitting in the turning lane whooo
Yours big but mine bigger mane
You wanna brag about a lil change
You need to step up your game lil boy
You better Hold up [x6]
You better sit your ass down
You better Hold up [x6]
You better sit your ass down

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
My bread stack high like mike in NBA highlights
Mansion means jacuzzi bubbling with sky lights
Uncle L juelz killin niggas eye sight
Wal mart stops since 87 like damn right
My wrist stay glistening
Two birds kissing and
I'm sick of all this money somebody call a physician in
The american dream I'm what niggas is visioning
You clowns ain't making it rain it's just drizzling
Acting like I ain't paid what you talking bout
I throw a party at the bank walk a million out
Got over 30 movies what you think you doing to me
You sold a couple records how you think you gon do me
You know I'm in shape I slap you you gon try and sue me
I buy you off slide off with your lil cutie
All the money is a god damn nusense
Look at my career yeah I'm the blueprint

[Chorus:]
You see me sitting in the turning lane whooo
Yours big but mine bigger mane
You wanna brag about a lil change
You need to step up your game lil boy
You better Hold up [x6]
You better sit your ass down
You better Hold up [x6]
You better sit your ass down
