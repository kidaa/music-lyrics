Ali 
Yeah, yeah, check, check 
See I ain't about playin, Leezy 'bout cash in advance 
Cash in on the casual, actual, factual plan 
Makin a killin man, went from that to makin a livin 
Rightous willin, the only thing supreme swimmin 
And proceed, to not smoke weed around the seed 
It's the new way, new life, peace true indeed, off T's 
I dwell on off how y'all plan makin mo' money, so I had to buy a fly chain 
Ran in this game, dirt broke, now it's MTV with Kurt Lod' 
With the Q-four-feezy, be hurtin folks 
Keep the bird toast, black handle, horoscope hood scandle 
You the type of niggas puffin in shirts, socks and sandels 
Keep the God in me, the Hova Ja knew Allah in me 
Ball wit' me, don't tell 'em who saw when 'bout to squall wit' me 
Fall wit' me, this pure mic dope I'm sellin 
It's the man with mellow rap, felon, constantly yellin  yo ma!  

Nelly 
Uh, uh, uh, uh 
What's it like bein Nelly, ay, let me break it down 
It's like a shootout and you the only nigga wit' rounds 
It's like a weed drought and you the only nigga wit' pounds 
It's like a Freaknik and you got the only brothers in town 
I'm like a shoe-in, for the poster boy, the thug of the year 
GQ style ma', let me put a bug in your err ear 
Go tell ya man, he take a step, there went a slug in his err ear 
Have 'em askin yo, how the hell he get a gun up in here? 
That's gotta be illegal, Bob! 
I can bring them chrome things for that drastic shit 
Metal detectors, no problem, got that plastic shit 
Witnessess,  I ain't seen 'em, they had masks and shit  
 Whoever it was, was in a rush 'cause they was fast and quick  
Oh, I'm just a playa, mo', these ain't my rules 
Peep game, I'm wearin Jordans, summer these my shoes 
I'm like the heir to the throne 
Me and my niggas fastbreak through your home, get ya coach on the phone 
Tell 'em  go'on  

Chorus 
Show 'em what they won, a short stay at the hotel, Bob 
Show 'em what they won, Alize, Mo', Crissy or ale, Bob 
Show 'em what they won, Murphy Lee, Key or Nell, Bob 
Show 'em what they won, what, show 'em what they won, who 
Show 'em what they won, niggas talkin shit get served, Bob 
Show 'em what they won, two to the head, left on the curb, Bob 
Show 'em what they won, leavin they mama's feelins hurt, Bob 
Show 'em what they won, what, show 'em what they won, who 
Show 'em what they won 

Kyjuan 
Ay yo, Bob, they want Keyjuan, the one who gets the job done 
Keep huns screamin  Keyjuan-na-na  
On the block I Rule like Ja, in the sun like Wa 
Me and mine at the mall spendin grands like Cool Bob 
See I'm a Ruger shooter, don't make me have to do ya 
Boo-ya, you see what Lunatics'll do to ya 
Tip-??? pursuer, get 'er in a room and do 'er 
First cat out the Lou that you knew that 
Wore a lime-green headband, matchin leather pants 
Vokal t-shirt with some sparklin wristbands 
This man, he keeps it real sweet 
With somethin sweeter than sweet, puffin on Swisher Sweets 
I'm unique, like a blue??? bird without the beak 
I'm deep, like bucket seats when the 'tics hit the streets 
Pick door number three if your price is right 
I'll pull a DJ Quik  tonite is the night  

Murphy Lee 
Hold on, so I can tell 'em who I is, a young school boy with one kid 
I think I'm five-eight, but yo, maybe I'm five-six 
With my boots off, I prefer my booties in boots off 
You get in my bed, you better take pants, shoes off 
Now, and not right now but right now! 
And I ain't backin down, she can get up and bounce 
The Young Dude, quick to roll up an ounce and head south 
Don't even have drive, I can sit on the couch 
And wrap somethin, and put on a beat and rap somethin 
They call me Mr. get all mad and smack somethin 
I'm wild dude, you could probably find me on side two 
If not I'm a holla like Ja Rule, get a dollar from my boo 
And go and by a juice or somethin 
A virgin rapper, I ain't gettin loose for nothin 
Money earnin rapper, I ain't got no boots for nothin 
So I'm servin rappers, I be cookin when I'm comin 

Chorus 2x
