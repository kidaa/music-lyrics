Hey, man, don't look so scared. 
You know I'm only testing you out. 
Hey man, don't look so angry, 
you're real close to figuring me out. 

We are a part of a circle. 
It's like a mobius strip, 
and it goes round and round until it loses a link. 
And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain, 
and shit is gonna fly once again. 

Hey, man, we look at each other with ample eyes, 
so why not some time to discover what's behind your eyes 
I've got so many questions that I want to ask you. 
I am so tired of mirrors- pour me a glass of your wine!

And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain, 
and shit is gonna fly once again! 
I've got a bunch of government cheques at my door. 
Each morning I try to send them back but they only send me more. 
I look at myself in the mirror; am I vital today 
Hey, man, I let my conscience get in the way! 

And there's a shadow in the sky , and it looks like rain, 
and shit is gonna fly once again, 
and I don't mean to rain on your parade, 
but pathos has got me once again... 
and I don't want ambivalence no more, 
I don't want ambivalence no more, 
I don't want ambivalence no more, 
no I don't want ambivalence no more!
