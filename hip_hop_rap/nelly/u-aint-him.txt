No way, uh-uh, and you ain't him
Stop it, quit it right now
And you ain't him

Here I is, sorry to keep you waitin'
But now I'm back with more fire than Satan
Listen, wish man this track is blazin'
Better yet, this track amazin'
This track remind me of when the studio was down in this Nick Day's basement
My shit was far from legal
Wrong place on a Buick Regal
Check under that seat, look in the back of that trunk is truly legal
Hold on, better pump your brakes
Don't wanna make no mistakes
Runnin' all the time might get you somethin' hot in your face
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no mace
I'm talkin' that shit that chase
That shit that'll bring you down and take forensic files gonna solve that case
I hear a lot of I did this
I hear a lot of I did that
It's funny when he go to the stand and point at his man like "he did that?"
You wanna stand like you're so not gangsta
Plead to the judge, "I'm so not gangsta"
Mm, mm, mm, I believe ya
See, it's just best to play yo cards
You don't try to be who you are
You ain't gotta prove nothin' to me
Motherfucker, I know you ain't got no heart

You say you got yo money right
I don't believe you
You say you live the street life
I don't believe you
You say you got them keys witchya
I don't believe you
I know a gangsta when I see him, little buddy, and you ain't him

I been watchin' you sucka, I got my eye on you, man

No, no, no, and you ain't him

He's a facade

No, no, no

He got drilled

And you ain't him

When you keep that drill, all the suckas wanna ride
Yeah, when you goin' 65 with yo skinny tires
He tellin' lies and sellin' pies, I'm sellin' mine
Shots fired, but he expired like this every time
How the fuck you cool? He don't even know the rules
He just flew the coop, he ain't got a chick you wanna move
But I'ma hand you this show him how it's got to go
Before you get to management, shorty, you gotta mop the floor
He's not a hustla, he's not a gangsta
Let me take your soul, sucka, I'll thank ya
I'm the boss, you gotta grind if you wanna flow

You say you move them chiggas right?
I don't believe you
You say you got a meal ticket
I don't believe you
You say you got a white Phantom too
I don't believe you

I know a hustla when I see him, little nigga and he ain't you

You say you got your money, right?
I don't believe you
You say you live the street life
I don't believe you
You say you got them keys witchya
I don't believe ya

I know a gangsta when I see him, little buddy and you ain't him

Lay back, smoke one

No, no, no

And you ain't him

No, no, no

And you ain't him

No, no, no

And you ain't him

No, I don't believe you
No, I don't believe you
No, I don't believe you

No, no, no, and you ain't him
