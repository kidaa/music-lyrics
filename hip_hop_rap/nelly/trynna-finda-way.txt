I left my heart in San Francisco with some club kids on a crowded street 
somewhere 
The sky was red and he said, 
"would you like to come be a part of my North American Dream"
I could try to chase life down, down the street and I'd find the separation 
of fact and fiction

[Chorus:]
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

I left my conscience somewhere with my rythym
I heard about it from the mouth of a man
He was hopping some trains and combing the land
Looking for a lover kiss planted in the east
Trying to run from the dreaded fist beast
And it lies, it lies in the picket fence call
It was my own paradise with my own private corridor

[Chorus]

So I'm dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed
My veins became a strain of light that I let to flow instead
And a wish came to me like Peter Pan at my window and said
Evolve your destiny child and you'll never walk alone-no
You'll never walk alone, but
Travel to the land of surrender till' you can't cry no more
Till you can't, till you can't
And you'll never walk alone

[Bridge:]
You'll nev, you'll nev, you'll never walk alone, you'll nev, 
you'll nev, you'll never walk alone..
... never walk, never walk alone alone alone-yeah/ all this inspiration is 
passing me by/all I can do is chill when I really wanna fly/and this 
pollution do nothing but dirty up my mind/faster than forever in the blink 
of an eye/to see past my lethargy is hard I feign/the beauty of my youth is 
gone but the chemicals remain

[Chorus]

I travel to this land of surrender but I see it's all over me, over and over 
again...and I try and I try and I try...an angel on my left side and a devil 
on my right..and they fight and they fight and they fight..they're fighting, 
they're fighting, they're fighting for my attention...hello You have my 
attention...Do I have your attention...Can I have your attention 
please...please, you've made such such an impression on me
