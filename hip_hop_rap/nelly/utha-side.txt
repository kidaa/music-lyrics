chorus
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'm gone take you anyway what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side x2

Inhale exhale I heard you're your clientele I'm doing well 
I see your woman out in the STL 
She's a fine honey that's  ?
I heard you even got a child now look at that
A baby momma and a bow-wow
My nigga know you need to calm down
F-for County run up in your house
But you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late
Now the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait
They got taps on your mobile phone
They do surveillance all around your home
Now you're piling everything you own
Calling on your partners for a loan
No more slip and sliding on the chrome
Your good days have come and gone
I tried to tell you

chorus
Now baby girl what's your name?
And tell me what's your claim to fame
Oh I can tell you do your thing
Just by checking out your diamond ring
I see you at the mall every day
Buying shanelle, fendi, Donna K
Plus I heard they took your job away 
And that you keep your shit on lay away
You got a four-five in Philly D you living large 
Like your last name was Kennedy or El' Debarge
Oh I just can't believe, that you made that money richeously
The kids asking what they mommy do
And why she lock us in the bedroom
I think mommy getting paid to screw
Cause every night it's a different dude
I tried to tell

chorus
Little man how old are you you can tell me
And what you doing skipping school
I see you running with your lil' crew
Y'all be fighting over read and blue
So now you wanna claim gangs
Even heard you bought a ? that ain't it
You started out with chronic on the grain
Now you're smoking other fettamain
I ain't trying to sway your dreams
Just trying to show you, that's it's other ways to make cream
Take it from me
 Just go to school and make something of 
Your young life and watch it blow up
You ain't gotta stop being cool
Don't even gotta stop flosin' fancy jewels and fast cars
Just keep it real with your game son
And don't forget were you came from
I'm trying to tell ya
