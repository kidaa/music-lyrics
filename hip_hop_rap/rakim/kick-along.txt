they said you'll grow up someday soon enough
the days gonna come when you put in your nine to five just like the next man
they said your friends will be fly by nights
so decide your fate at fourteen
all of them live someone else's dream to be sold
they all look down their nose on me like I'm below them
all of them said to go nowhere is a disease
so decide you're running out of time
that's what they always used to say to me and you
when we dream of a different day
the voices were there to remind us that we're getting old
and our worst fears were right all along
they said you'd grow up someday soon enough
the days gonna come when you put in your nine to five just like the next man
all of them said to go nowhere is a disease so decide your fate at fourteen
