I feel like everybody said I would feel
It's over now, so kill the lights
I need what everybody said I would need
I'm tied uptight by your china voice
That always broke when I made you sad

Stay with me stay
Don't leave in this way
Stay with me stay
I'll do whatever you say

I do what everybody said I would do
It's over now, so kill the lights
I go where everybody said I would go
Like a weeping child, were you the only one
That made it feel right being me

Stay with me stay
Don't leave in this way
Stay with me stay
I'll do whatever you say

And like today awaits tomorrow
And like tomorrow needs today
I need your simple words to follow
I'll do whatever you say

Stay with me stay
Don't leave in this way
Stay with me stay
I'll do whatever you say
Stay with me stay
