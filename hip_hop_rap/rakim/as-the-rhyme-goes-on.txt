MARY MAGDALENE

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh. Don't you know
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And we want you to sleep well tonight.
Let the world turn without you tonight.
If we try, we'll get by, so forget all about us tonight

APOSTLES' WIVES

Everythings alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

MARY MAGDALENE

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you, and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh. Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool, and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight.

APOSTLES' WIVES

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

JUDAS

Woman your fine ointment, brand new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor.
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more.
People who are hungry, people who are starving
They matter more than your feet and hair!

MARY MAGDALENE

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh. Don't you know

APOSTLES' WIVES and MARY

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

JESUS

Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling.
Look at the good things you've got.
Think while you still have me!
Move while you still see me!
You'll be lost, and you'll be sorry when I'm gone.

MARY MAGDALENE

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh. Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes, and relax think of nothing tonight.

APOSTLES' WIVES

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.
