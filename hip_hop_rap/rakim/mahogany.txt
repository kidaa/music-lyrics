So true - funny how it seems always in time

But never in line for dreams.
Head over heels
when toe to toe -
This is the sound of my soul
this is the sound.
I bought a ticket to the world but now I've come back again.
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh
I want the truth to be said.
I know this much is true
I know tkis much is true.
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun.
Listening to Manrin all night long -
This is the sound of my soul
this is the sound.
Always slipping from my hands
sand's a time of it's own.
Take your seaside arms and write the next line

Oh
I want the truth to be known.
I know this much is true
I know this much is true
I bought a ticket to the world but now I've come back again. . ..
This much is true. this much is true
this much is true
