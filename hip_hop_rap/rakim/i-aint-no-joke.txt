Here come the getaway car
Inside, the getaway star
Here come the getaway car
The getaway car don get that far
Here come the getaway car
Inside, the getaway star
Here come the getaway car
The getaway car don get that far

Police sirens going the wrong way but it makes no difference
There nowhere left for you to go
This is no way to spend a day
Looking back, scared shitless
I telling you nothing you don know

Here come the getaway car
This ain no film star
Here come the getaway car
The getaway car no Jaguar
Here come the getaway car
This ain no film star
Here come the getaway car
The getaway car no Jaguar

Some of the people stop and stare but where the glamour?
Just two scared kids in a dirt cheap car

This is no way to spend a day
Looking back, scared shitless
I telling you nothing you don know

There sits the getaway car
Smashed up, won get that far
Doors wide, the getaway car
On foot, the getaway star
There sits the getaway car
Damn close but no cigar
This was the getaway car
The getaway car don get ... far!
