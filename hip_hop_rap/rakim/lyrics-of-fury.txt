As far as I know, the world don't spin
They carry you around in your bed
And rearrange the stars all night
to satisfy you
Satisfy you
Satisfy you
Satisfy you
Satisfy you

Could I redeem myself
If I was someone else
I'd walk on the water
In your dad's swimming pool
Show you my bloody palms
If I thought that would satisfy you
Satisfy you
Satisfy you
Satisfy you
Satisfy you

Now I'm not wise, and I'm not old
So I'll be bitter, and I'll be cruel
I just did it less each and every day
Did I satisfy
Did I saaaaaaaatisfy-ha-ah-ah-ay ha-ah-ah you
Until satisfy-ha-ah-ah-ay ha-ah-ah you
Until satisfy satisfy you, satisfy you
Until satisfy satisfy you, satisfy you
Until satisfy satisfy you, satisfy you
Until satis--oh till I satisfy satisfy you, satisfy you
Until I satisfy
