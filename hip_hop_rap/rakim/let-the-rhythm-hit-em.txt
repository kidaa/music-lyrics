Last night my mother said to me
I'm sick of making history
There's got to be a better way
But we've got all these bills to pay
And they ain't just gonna go away
Like a factory - about to be shut down
Another factory - about to be shut down

Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold
Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold
Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold

You're gonna like this one, you're gonna like this one
I do
See if Mr. Botha was a man
He'd tip the hat, he'd pass the can
But he don't talk for you and me
I saw him on the BBC
His eyes looked like a factory
About to be shut down
His eyes looked like a factory
With the lights out - about to be shut down

Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold
Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold
Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold

Last night my mother said to me
I'm sick of making history
There's got to be a better way
For you to be
Last night my mother said to me
When you grow up what will you be
If not the white minority
At least protect me
I'm not a factory about to be shut down

Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold
Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold
Sold - did you hear it? - I'm sold

Sold - There's got to be a better way than this
