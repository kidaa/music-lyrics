The headphones is on fire dis time around, Styles 
Blood Pressure 
Y'all just bear wit me 
Yo, last time I'ma tell these niggas, man 
Can't fuck around, man 
Jada, man 
Whoever
Old nigga, new nigga 
Wha!! Yo, yo, yo... 

Verse 1: Jadakiss 

Who really da best rapper since B.I.G. ain't here 
Y'all know da answer to dat when Kiss ain't here 
When you see me, don't ask me nothin about us 
And don't definatly ask me nothin about... 
Fuck it 
You owe me one, I owe you two 
I woulda smacked you wit da burner, but I know you'd sue 
And I ain't talkin to him 
I'm talkin to you 
Matter of fact, I'm talkin to y'all 
Life is like walkin a yard 
Nigga'll stab you wit a fork in da heart 
And The Source got muthafuckas thinkin they hot 
Like my dope 
Got fiends thinkin they shot 
When you thinkin of da best, nigga 
Think of The Lox 
I'll cut ya fuckin hand off if ya pinky ring's hot 
Then come thru ya block in a sticky green drop 
Hop out 
Let off fifty-three shots 
Wouldn't care if I hit fifty-three cops 
Guliani might as well be merkin niggas 
Cuz the time that he givin out is hurtin niggas 
And all these record label's jerkin niggas 
And you never was a thug, you's a workin nigga 
And you heard that shit right there? 
I started that 
Don't make me put somethin up in ya Starter hat 
No matter who you are, or where you from 
Screw all of dat 
I'm not tryin to hear dat, son 

Hook: 2x 

Now, who da fuck y'all want? Jadakiss!! 
And who da fuck y'all need? Jadakiss!! 
And who da fuck gon' bleed? 
All y'all hataz, cuz none of y'all niggas can't fuck wit Jada!! 

Verse 2: Jadakiss 

Don't you be dat clown nigga in da back of da whip 
That's gon' get the second half of da clip 
And all I'm sayin, it'll be da other nigga in the front of the da whip 
Runnin his lip, wit a gun on his hip 
Feel me dawg? 
Everybody walk da walk 'til they run into Kiss 
Then, they get stabbed, or hung, or stung wit da fifth 
How you think ya man hard when son on my dick? 
Cuz I can get his ass body, plus front him a brick 
Got a chick named Super-head 
She give super-head 
Just moved in the buildin, even gave the super head 
I cop big guns that spit super lead 
So, play Superman, end up super dead 
Call ne Kiss, or da kid from The Lox 
That'll twist ya moms out and do a bid wit ya pops 
We was in jail, you probably won't get no mail 
And if you pumped on my block, you won't get no sales 
When ya CEO know you can't fuck wit I 
I make a million by June 
I'm sayin fuck July 
And I beg you to try me while I'm holdin da Tommy 
I'ma have ya body all over da lobby 
I already helped y'all 
I'm about to melt y'all 
Tell the truth, dawg 
I ain't never felt y'all 
This album, we gon' bubble like Seltzer 
If it ain't Double R, who da hell else is hard?! 

Hook until end
