Hugh Hugh 
You know we had to 'dis right 
Hugh Hugh 
It just wouldn't be right 

Verse One:Sheek 

Yo
Ayo
Yo I'ma b-boy standin in my b-boy stance 
Glock on my hip is big is the dick in my pants 
You don't want nuttin wit sheek you soft as fuck 
I leave a single shotgun shell on top of your truck 
Wit a horseshoe to let you know you pressin' ya luck 
You don't want nuttin wit kiss, nuttin wit styles 
You don't wanna end up food for the crocodiles
I'd take the gun off ya waste and smack ya 
And turn around and point it at ya mink and give you one 
I'm the reason why ya peeps not in ICU 
Cause believe me when you ain't watchin I see you 
From the Hamptons to the place where you like to eat 
I put somethin in them mams you keep thinkin is sweet 
I'm in the bushes all night calm wit' the Tommy 
Waitin for you to skinny dip wit' that mommy 
While she waitin for the night i'm waitin for her flight 

Chorus: Jadakiss 
2X

No we ain't 
Wit dem 
No more cause we ruffrydin 
Get it out ya head now 
LOX is back now 
Show a little love now 
Pump it in the club now 

Verse Two:  Jadakiss 

Yo if you should die tonight 
It's cause I said peel his cap 
We on Ruffryders now 
How real is that 
It's the kiss of death everybody know J- face 
Us gettin off similar to OJ's case 
Just better rhymes and better beats involved 
Less politics more of the streets involved 
Things always go smooth when the heats involved 
Sign today or get beat tommorow 
First one talkin that family shit 
And get a lotta doe and don't give the family shit 
I don't care how many ? you wrote 
I just wanna see how you gonna dance when your neck get broke 
if yall do fall down i'ma scoop the ? 
No shiny suits 
Everybody boots and jeans 
The industry is one thing being real is another 
That means i'll steal your mother 

Chorus: 2x 

Verse Three: Styles 

Yo if you left the peak ballin i don't feel yo ass 
I wish duke was still alive and they killed yo ass 
You can keep an industry but don't you come to the hood 
I got a thousand niggas like me and they feel like suge 
If you think i'm beefin for nuttin then rob me dog 
I'm from the hood 
And I ain't bee robbed before 
Tell you screw all the paper work 
You can lie in dirt 
Walk through the valley nigga tell me if the iron hurt 
Ruffryder now cause that's where the bombs at 
And i tell niggas fuck that car jack 
Take the roley out the air put the don back 
Can't wear shiney suits on combat 
Guess i got personal beef 
You worse then a thief 
Probably be your man that'll work you to sleep 
We goin put the guns down and we ain't bringin a crew 
You got friends that hate yo ass more than we do nigga 

Outro: L.O.X. 

We don't give a fuck about ya  3x 
We gonna be alright with out ya 

Chorus: 6x
