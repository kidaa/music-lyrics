Puff talking 
Why they always talking about money? 
Cause we like money bitch 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
L-O-X and we won't stop 
Bad Boy, I'm a show you how we get this money 

Stylez
You can't take this 
Players hate this 
Rainbow glow 
European bracelet 
Made his mouth drop, now he need a face lift 
Mommies run up on me and ask me to taste it 
Hand on my crotch 
Got to be the sales or the band on my watch 
Damn I'm so hot! 
They call me arrogent 
While you slide with seven mommies in a Caravan 
You start traveling 
I'll make you a believer 
Hotter in the club getting brain from a diva 
Leave with a beezer 
Black Cadillac riding with an old geezer 
With ten different hustles so every foe sees us 
No reason 
We just peas in a pod 
trying to get the paper 
We the g's in the lot 
Long as the water boil we bound to keep it hot 
It's gon' be turmoil if you thinking that it's not 

Chorus x2 
Puff
I'm a show you how you get this money Make it hot 
I'm a show you how you get this money Don't stop 
I'm a show you how you get this money I fucks wit you 
I'm a show you how you get this money Get money 

Jadakiss
Three fly cats that get money with go gimmicks 
Y'all just so timid 
My soldiers be no limit 
What you know about renting a yacht with twenty jet-skis 
And riding out till the Coast Guard come and get me 
Beat that! 
Me, Stylez, and Sheek be like 4, 5, 6 so no matter what you roll you 
can't beat that 
Who you know could take an old record and flip like Puff? 
From small clubs to arenas 
Who flip like us? 
Everytime they pull up 
Whips be plush 
Chicks be tough 
Bad Boy, Hits R Us 
Back it's me, West Indies 
Slimmy
Me and Kimmy 
And I taught her how to say, "May I have a steady gimme" 
I ain't bustin cause we picked up them joints you tossed 
Y'all was hot until The Lox came and cooled y'all off 
It's the Kiss 
Are you hearing me? 
I think I'm blessed lyrically 
Mad rappers with three LP's sill fearing me 

Chorus x2 

Sheek
You see, we bounce on tracks like bas-ketball 
And bust down songs till our throat need Halls 
L-O-X-pedition
I spend all day fishing 
And won't catch one 
Just me and mommy out in the sun 
Just sailing, chain so icy if I threw it up 
You think it was hailing 
Don't even ask me what the price be 
To go to a show, no clubs just arenas 
Headliner Stevie Wonder, no small cat between us 
After parties be goin like Venus 
My chick gots be the meanest 
Before I come 
That night 
If she ain't she ain't partying right 
That's how we like to play in Bad Boys with all the fly shit 
And that's how we do the chips kid 
Multiplying
Beef, don't apply it 
Please don't try it cause we ain't with that 
But if so you gon' need a plastic bag where your shit at 
Lox and we got that cash you want to get at 

Chorus x3
