Intro:
SP Killer 
Yeah yeah yeah, L-O-X, L-O-X motherfucker 
Niggas don't know how we bout to come this time 
No more shiny suits 
None of that shit 

Chorus: x2 
[Sheek Luchion] 
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E 
[Jadakiss]
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G. 
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy 
[Sheek Luchion] 
Explain thing further 
Murder or get murdered 

Verse 1: 
[Styles Paniro] 
Half of the hustle, half of them killers 
All of them Niggas wanna kill Paniro 
Better send the guerrilla's 
Cause beef is like a brand new car 
You better ride 
Everytime I sleep I die 
Wish I was gone ya know 
Felt dumb when I was young 
I used to wish I was on 
I'ma stay blunted and red with one in the head 
Niggas thinkin' they the don 
Till their shit get bombed 
I put 4 in your shootin' arm 
2 in your legs 
Like 10 in your chest 
The last one in your head 
I give you the whole clip, 
like you cheated and stole shit 
Knocked off the pack, flossed and no chips 
You know the business 
Empty rap kill your co-defendant 
Keep it male and catch a body in trial 
If you want a Nigga dead than do it Holiday Styles 
Come with 2 guns up and empty both off the clips 
Kill you whole fuckin' crew and go 'n smoke on the fifth 

Chorus: x2 

Verse 2: 
[Sheek Luchion] 
Yo, yo, yo 
I come to your town on a Peter Pan, no Jack 
One pair of clothes, 2 hoes and buggy with that 
Wanna beef me?, y'all Niggas is borrowin' heat 
Callin' all across town to borrow a full pound 
Meanwhile this Nigga got his guns to your noggin 
While your man with the heat is with some bitch up in the project 
He clappin' at you, you duckin', makin' you dance 
You should have spent it on some guns 
Instead of Iceberg pants 
What, L.O.X. off top, pullin' our triggers 
With our guns on our lap, we ride around like Cali NiggersWESTSIIIDE 
Target motherfuckers, cold hearted motherfuckers 
Stead of young dumb your moms, and whoever she got with her 
There's a new-born in the house, 
then I'm killin' the babysitter 
Y'all Niggas all clowns in Sheek eyes 
Your moms would wear glasses, 
with the nose disguise around me 
Talkin greasy 
Y'all like watermelons 
Big but crack easy 

Chorus: x2 

Verse 3: 
[Jadakiss]
Now if you know Jay, 
I never been a brother to front 
I be in L.A. wearin' any colors I want 
Rock guns like shirts, block under the punk 
And I put somethin' hot, anyone of you chumps 
And I know a few of you wanna get my watch 
But it a be funeral if you get my watch 
It ain't nothing y'all can do to stop the Lox' wealth 
Run up in a gunstore, cop the top shelf 
The Crack-game is dead, all they want is weed now 
Chicks that I went to school with, a seed now 
You know Kiss, stocky bald head, light brown 
Ice down, in my roll look like nighttown 
To all y'all lil' Jada's for the 1000th time 
I recall hittin' your moms or writin' your rhymes 
And just because you might have seen me, 
in and out of your house 
Is no way that she gon have a baby out of her mouth 

Chorus: till end
