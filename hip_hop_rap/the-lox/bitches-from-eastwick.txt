Ugh, Ugh, Ugh, Ugh 
Aiyo I woke up in a daze wit da slight headache 
You know tha usual tha studio gettin red late 
Serious jetlag when I get to bed late 
That why I fuck cause I be weak when I get head late 
Today I got a session wit Ronnie I mean Veronica 
Met her last year about a week before Hanukkah 
Sounds foolish I mean honey wasn't jewish 
But she had a lot of dough and she was nice on computers 
She told me she was born and raised in Bermuda 
And came here to get a job as a tutor 
I pursued make a long story short screwed her 
She moved and she came back still on tha same track 
Same wit same chips ass it was still fat 
I aint really think she wuz a freak 
But she did ask a lotta questions bout Stylez and Sheik 
She called me and said she was in town fo a week 
The Westside, Manhattan, the Suite and tha Marquise 
How I felt about gettin up fo old times sake 
Ima bring Stylez and Sheik wit me datta be great 
Jus have two friendz we gon bring da truck and tha new Benz 
Desert in da stashin da Sony cam zoom lens 
All have ourselves one big hell of a weekend 
Eat at Puff's joint an catch a show at tha beacon 
Twist a dutch blaze from Y-O to the Hudson 
Pass tha tall one 2-5 we still puffin' 
We got tha heat on a cold night n da winter 
Stylez you remember, Sheik you remember 

Sheek
Oh yeah, I remember dem hoes dat night 
We wuz at da beacon right 
Chris Tucker performing 
All of us wuz in der outside it wuz stormin 
Cats and Dogs 
Aiyyo dese hoes wuz tough 
Besides tha air condition on high we wuz icy enough 
From my neck to da belt buckle to our shoes shall i go on 
Wit 5 of us up front he needed shades to perform 
Mose from tha flo up we inside toe up 
I drink dey smoke no coke 
Besides tha shit he said on stage tha cash we had on us wuz no joke 
I slid fo seats down she sittin der smilin 
Lookin like she from an island not them chicks dat be out wilin' 
Told me dat her name wuz Cindy 
Favorite show Mark and Mindy 
Favorite color green no kids but plan to have plenty 
We chit den chat bout dis n dat 
From what kind of whip she push 
To what bar she be at 
She played hard to get 
But we made it from tha movie to tha jacuzzi 
From tha jacuzzi to the bed 
We fucked until we both got woozy 
Woke up breath stinkin 
Yawnin and shit 
I smelt breakfast in tha kitchen but where wuz da bitch 
I walked in der it wuz cheese eggs and grits on da table 
Wit beef sausages and orange juice next to da cable 
Wit a note sayin sorry I had to rob you baby but 
I need  cash like you I aint your ordinary slut 
or dick teaser please I need food in my freezer 
and by the time you read dis note I done been spent yo Visa

Cause she like to fuck doggy style plus hold da D 
But now I got to handle dis cause dey skandalous

Crept to tha kitchen

Tried tha gun holster with tha forty fo maganet 
Shot her in da heart 
Den caught tha earchess fabanet 
Den I seen Cindy 
Tha bitch tried to end me 
Running out da living room 
Bustin off Kissimee 
The bitch couldnt aim 
So I blew her out da frame 
Turned around to Beatrice 
Why you look speachless 
We could have lived it up and jus fucked on tha beaches 
And now you gotta die 
And da stupid bitch is reaching 
B'fo I cocked it back

Saw Sheek and James 
Started muthafucking squeezin'
