Puff talking 
See, I want to get back to the love 
Let's start love over, come on 

Chorus Carl Thomas 
Let's start love over 
Back to the way things were 
Forget about them 
Cause all we got is us 
We can make it 
Sad if we try 
I want to start love over 
Let's make it do or die 

Stylez
When I was nine years old 
I realized there was a road 
At the end I would win lots of pots of gold 
Days, when I used to have my play clothes on 
I would make up my rhymes the middle of Voltron 
But you've learned what the herbs do 
Breaking curfew 
Hit the park when it's dark, make it stand like a podium 
Niggas had a box and a strip of linoleum 
Some break a boogie but those that don't 
Was usually a fighter 
Rollin' easy riders 
Sending people to the store for a soda and a lighter 
A real cool cat that would let you keep a dollar 
But now things change and it's the days of tomorrow 
Little kids is big now 
They'll push your wig now 
Can't send them to the store 
But you can send them for roll 
And put them on my vine 
And give them one big push for all mankind 

Chorus

Jadakiss
People still taking rapping for a joke 
A passing hope 
Or a phrase with a rope 
What ever happened to the caddies, white walls, and spokes? 
Crates of records, turntables, plenty of folks 
Remember playing in the streets, touch football 
Look y'all 
Somebody get mad and bounce with they football 
Twenty four hour block parties 
Everybody on the block pissing you a dark hardy 
Adults used to think I was scheming 
But I was dreaming to one day make a hot album and have 'em all fiendin' 

Now everytime that I rhyme I can tell that you like it 
Be nursing the tunes like the mind of a psychic 
Your mind is weary, floating like a dove 
Sweating and things, like you were making love 
Control the crowd so they can accept it 
Total concentration is the perfect method 

Bridge looped while Puff talks 
Where's the love? 
Somebody tell me 
Where's the love? 
Because we want to know 

Puff talking 
I remember everybody I loved, everybody 
It wasn't always player hating 
There wasn't jealousy and all this envy 
It was the love 

Sheek
Ayo hip hop 
Set out in the park 
What?
We used to do it out in the dark 
All night long till the cops made us go 
Or till somebody's moms pulled the extension cord from the window 
Lees on, thinking you fresh 
Trying to impress 
Shorty with the baby hair pushed down on her forehead 
Ponytail swaying, she hot 
Standing like she bull legged, but she not 
You remember the days? 
That's when crack was affecting blacks like that 
Just drink some Valentine Ale, little reefer 
Friday night, go check out Star Child at the theater 
That's all corrupt 
Over rap you might get bust 
Say the wrong thing 
End up in a permanent sling 
Went from shelltops to hollowtops 
Used to rock the bus stop 
Now we electric slide from the cops 
Want some veterans in this 
That ain't keeping it real 
Now with God we chill over a record deal 
Always the good ones to go 
Never your enemies die 
Till this day I wonder why they took my man B.I. 
No time to yell rhymes in the microphone 
Take this more serious than just a poem 
Rock party to party 
While you're out the door 
But tear it up yo, let's start love over 

Chorus
