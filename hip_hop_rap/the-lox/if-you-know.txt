Intro:
[Sheek]
Yo I might get drunk 
[Jadakiss]
Jeckel and Hyde 
Roll these with lemons 
[Sheek]
I'm tellin' y'all Niggas 
Swizz Beatz 

Chorus: 
[All]
If you know, like we know, like they know 
L.O.X. is the best 
If you know, like we know, like they know 
Swizz Beatz is the best 
If you know, like we know, like they know 
Ruff Ryders is the best 
If you know, like we know, like they know 
We'll bring it to their chest 

Verse 1: 
[Sheek a.k.a Louch] 
Yo if I can't make money 
Then you can't either 
If I didn't have to rap 
I have blown in the freezer 
[Styles a.k.a Holiday] 
If I can't rock Nikes 
or Tim's with double soles 
I have the 9 in the pound 
And leave your ass full of holes 
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood] 
If I didn't push a Benz 
And I didn't push a Lex 
Then the Ambulance will come 
And they be pushin' on your chest 
[Swizz Beatz] 
If I couldn't hit the studio 
and make another record 
For my double R Niggas 
I'll lay y'all on stretchers 
[Sheek a.k.a Louch] 
Now I might get drunk 
Or I might get high 
But my game stay Trump 
And my style stay fly 
[Styles a.k.a Holiday] 
I might hit a dime 
Or I might hit a duece 
And when I wanna go to war 
Is when you wanna call a truce 
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood] 
I might buy 'em cooked 
Dough I might buy 'em raw 
And I might tap your chin 
Or I might cross your jaw 
[Swizz Beatz] 
Now I might go 18's 
I might go 20's 
I might use dumdums 
Cause y'all Niggas dummies 

Chorus: 

Verse 2: 
[Sheek a.k.a Louch] 
Ayo, me without weight 
Is like Harlem without 8 
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood] 
Yeah, me with no funds 
Is like Queens with no dunns 
[Styles a.k.a Holiday] 
And me with no beef 
Is like Brooklyn with no guns 
[Swizz Beatz] 
Man and me with no beats 
Is like Cali with no blunts 
[Sheek a.k.a Louch] 
First I got head from her 
Then I hit her from the back 
Then she told me that she hustled 
So I hit her with a pack 
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood] 
Yeah, screw how many mics you got 
How much ice you got 
My bullets'll make you icy-hot 
[Styles a.k.a Holiday] 
Y'all, all my Niggas killas 
We don't talk on the phone 
And give a way better message 
When we come in your home 
[Swizz Beatz] 
Yo, catch me Down-South 
When I'm pumpin' up things 
and my name ain't Rover 
Don't jump on my rings 
[Sheek a.k.a Louch] 
Man, you gotta have your hustle right 
When you up in the game 
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood] 
You gotta have your lawyor money 
For you firm-aly change 
[Styles a.k.a Holiday] 
And don't you leave out the house 
Without bringer your things 
[Swizz Beatz] 
We gonna Ruff Ryde, Nigga 
>From here to the bank 

Interlude:
[Sheek a.k.a Louch] 
What you greaseball cocksuckers thought it was over 
This double R, Nigga, L.O.X. 
We are the streets 
When the kennels is open the dogs is biting, bitch 
Shits real 

Verse 3: 
[Drag-on]
Yo, yo, yo, yo 
I might pull up in a V, 
that cost more than a buck 
Then turn around and burn it 
Cause you thought it was plush 
[Eve]
Anytime I get on fire 
I get a car to match 
And tell any rapper you name 
You gard it black 
[Drag-On]
When I bust my hammer 
I nail my Nigga 
We the Ruff Ryder family 
All hail, my Niggas 
[Eve]
And I might ride, I might die 
That's up to the Lord 
And my Niggas might come home 
That's up to the ? 
[Drag-On]
Yo, If money make you feel good 
I'm happy with lead 
Joe Pesci-style 
Kickin' Niggas after they dead 
[Eve]
Picture the litter 
Hold the 4-5th for my Niggas 
Writin' the venom 
Ass look right in the dinner 
[Drag-On]
?Dockin'? you pay 
Word from me you clockin' the Yay 
I hustle for real 
Let you hold the block for a day 
[Eve]
Pull it in your brain 
And give you a hot idea 
You wanna low 
Here's a casket you can hide out there 

Chorus: til fade
