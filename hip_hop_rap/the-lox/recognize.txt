Now I know you couldn't wait to hear 'Kiss over Premier 
Kill you on tape then, watch it over a beer 
cause you ain't nothing but a movie with expensive footage 
That's the reason they gon' leave you with expensive bullets 
Ain't none of y'all better than LOX 
Have all of y'all dressed up in a suit, dead in a box 
Me and my niggas get Redd-er than Foxx 
And I don't care if I love you, I still want head of the drop 
Niggas runnin' round talkin' that Y-2-K shit 
Crackheads'll still gon' want that gray shit 
that's why I'ma always cop the yay quick 
so I suggest all of y'all stay on Jay dick 
Too hard for MTV, not black enough for BET, just let me be 
Give me all my royalty money, and let me greed 
and I'ma have hoes for six, and hash for three 

Chorus

Sheek Luchion 
Ayo I give it to you point blank, in your mom's place 
So like +Point Break+ with a mask on with president's face 
clear my space, when big sheek crash the boards 
Y'all aint just mark niggas, y'all Hallmark niggas 
With all that soft ass writin might as well be in cards 
You gon' gamble with your life, when I launch these torpedos 
that'll shoot the crack out your ass at Foxwood Casinos 
Just me and my gambino's drunk as fuck 
with a time parking lot DVD in a trunk 
I been drunk most my life, don't ask me why 
Through ninth grade, I ain't go to high school 
I went to school high 
And I don't care what y'all got, that shit don't excite me 
I'm black and deadly and my burner just like me 
and I'm quick to stick one of y'all on tour 
with the Sheraton, see what yours can be mine 
without, inheritin, give up your chains 
and them little diamonds in your ear 
Is it worth your family cryin and the doctor yellin "clear"? 

Chorus 

Styles Pinero 
If I knew heaven had a ghetto that was sweeter than here 
You know P would pack his bag  and just leave next year 
but I got a son to raise 
So I'ma stay in this hell and I gotta gun to blaze 
If you play with the L dot O dot X dot at the end 
we the niggas that's gon' leave, with the pot at the end 
Never too young to die or too old to live 
? to bust your gun, go home and mold your kid 
I'm ashamed I sell crack but I'ma ryde for the moment 
Know the concequence I'ma die with +The Omen+ 
Two is better than one, there's three of The LOX 
Ki in a pot, key in the drop, key to the top 
father, son, and holy ghost of rap 
3 in a 1 seein a gun and usin' it dog 
Dope in a six, coke in a five, weed in a four 
Ice is for my niggas, but the heat is for y'all
