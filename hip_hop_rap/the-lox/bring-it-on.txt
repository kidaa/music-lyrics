Ohh
Ay Yo Swizz 
What's up 
I told you baby this the one right here 
This is the one 
Sheek Louch 
Omigod
Yo yo yo Ay yo 

CHORUS 2X: 
Ay yo y'all niggas want war? 
Bring it on c'mon 
Y'all want war with Sheek? 
Bring it on c'mon 
Y'all tryin na stop how I eat? 
Bring it on c'mon , bring it on c'mon , bring it on c'mon 


[Sheek: Verse 1] 
Yo how you gon talk shit when you soft as pudding 
Knowing the work that these real thugs put in 
We too legit 
Let me hear you rap something bout us 
I'ma break the hands of the man who wrote your shit 
We take minks off backs 
Them grime niggas in clubs that make niggas walk 
With them bodyguard cats 
I'm glad I'm free 
I feel like Harriet Tubman came and got me 
>From the white man property 
It's all glitz and glitter but no cash you getting 
You hear the difference in that shit that I'm spittin 
Double R 
That's street shit and that's the way it has to be 
Myself , Sheek Louch , and I'm still MTV 
I can talk about guns 
Go out smack some nuns 
Then flip and do a song with country music and shit 
Don't ever play LOX for no fucking retard 
Cuz your dough aint that long that you can't see God 
Plus these rap niggas out here respect the god 
They know we spit that shit so they respect our sound 
They know how hard a motherfucker is and water that's down 
Here that's that shit right there 
I swear from Yonkers motherfucker 
We'll bust in the air 
Aint nobody killin clouds over here 
Respect us 
You bleed how we bleed 
We bust how you bust 
Yo Swizz help me out sing this chorus for us 
C'mon

CHORUS 2X 

[Verse 2] 
Ay yo this here is for them cats that wild nonstop 
Can't dance just play the club and bop 
No respect for the law 
Fuck security son 
Cuz you big that aint stopping me from bustin my gun 
It's a fact that fire burns and shit stink 
It's also a fact that your vest only protectin your chest 
You aint think about your head when you was talkin that mess 
Or this knife 
Across your face scar you for life 
Now do you really wanna rock that ice? 
Heh heh 
Do your security really love your life? 
Or do they just want their check 
You think they gon take one in the neck 
For a nigga with no respect 
For his crew 
Man we don't wear half on Chinese food 
Slept in the same bed 
Same chick gave us head 
Brothers , and we aint gon stop till we all dead 
Aint shit gon change 
Just the dough gon change 
Fuck a Bentley 
I'm good with a rubberband colored range 
I empty a clip at you you send nothing in exchange 
Y'all niggas mad soft no heart all brains 
But what's smart when a dumb dumb burst your heart 
I'm done now but first hold up hold your applause 
I got one question to ask y'all do y'all niggas want war? 

CHORUS 6X 

[Swizz ad libs to end]
