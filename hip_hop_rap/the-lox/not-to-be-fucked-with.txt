Stylez
Another small town cat with a million dollar fetish 
Learned my first lesson in jail from a peasant 
Always seem pleasant 
Happy to be present 
Said he past due, shouldn't have been in the essence 
Streets is like your girl, treat it like your wife 
You can flirt around with drugs, but don't hit the pipe 
You can mess around with guns but death ain't right 
Hold your breath, next step, cause life ain't right 
If you with the wrong cats then your cyph ain't tight 
Stylez hit the darkside, show them the light 
Life ended to the ice that freezes m.c.'s 
Friend of the flame, burn 'em in one game 
Tell oxygen he ain't hoppin in 
He a little time nigga, I ain't thinking of stoppin him 
Catch up first, you stretch up worse than them 
Been experts and done less work than them 
With no album, we net worth more than them 
These cats didn't think that the Lox could do it 
Got a hundred different styles that will guide you through it 
I'm the ghost of this shit, I provide you fluid 
Never crack sidewalks or ride the sewers 
You got some fly shit, but my shit 
Is like the whole city fallin out the sky bitch 
Loud tracks 
I'm the quiet loud ass 
Quick to set it off on your fucking foul ass 
Make six digits eight and cop a palace 
Make every rapper sick and call me malace 
Y'all niggas never know what the Stylez have 
Some shit in the stash that would crack a cow's back 
In a hundred pieces in they ass, and how's that? 
Never answer back, I'm the cancer on the track 
Just think, I could blink, and make the Pink Panther black 

Chorus x2 
Jadakiss
Who's not to be fucked with? 
Stylez
That's me 
Jadakiss
Who's to be fucked with? 
Stylez
That's them 
Why don't you watch my back while I go ask them? 
Jadakiss
And if they want beef later on I splash them 
Stylez
And if they want to flow, right now I thrash them 
Should I give it to them new style or old fashion 

Stylez
Do I have to break down the walls 
Stay off the floor 
I'm the general dog, I start the war 
Make every m.c. never spit again 
When I leave 'em empty 
No guts, no chest, no brain, no game 
Stylez go broke, I'm a rob the folk train 
I feel no pain 
Steal cocain 
Fuck black thugs that run through whole gangs 
Anytime that I want it nigga, better listen 
Blunt is the magic wand, I'm the magician 
Stylez is the virus, ain't no physician 
With an anecdote that can stop my colission 
Before you start asking, I'm a start splashing 
When I come through, it's like ten planes crashing 
Twenty ships, full of thugs, all of them is bastards 
Mashed up, looking through binocs, about to crash in 
What's the next issue? 
Sheek did official 
Called Spielberg, cops get tissue 
So you can rock in the sky when feds come and get you 
Next question is where nasa at? 
We need a hundred g's, can fly, when traffic bad 
When we down on the craps 
We plasmic gats 
Tellin you now you can't fuck with dinero 
Got a lot of space when it seem real narrow 
Sagitarrius style, spittin out arrows 
Hundred at a time, killin a hundred heroes 

Chorus x2
