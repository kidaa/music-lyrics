[Brain Mcknight]

Quietly I watch you sleep
Hopefully you won't hear what I say
Wondering if I turned the clouds
Happy the moment I tasted your rain
Tonight was the night
That I saw my first sight
Of how pleasure wins over pain
Now I know what I know
Don't wanna ever let you go
I just hope that you feel the same

You shot your arrow
Through my restless, shaking heart
You came down on me slow
Drew back your bow
My lady, you shot your arrow
Straight through my heart

I kiss your mouth and stroke your hair
Intently I hang on your every breath
I know what I'm feeling right now
Is more than just lust
For the sake of your flesh
Girl, I need you now
I'll try my best to learn how
To be all that my words might say
Caressing your skin
I never imagined
That I'd ever feel this way

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]

Girl, I need you
I'll try my best to learn how
To be all that my words might say
Caressing your skin
I never imagined I could ever feel this way

[CHORUS]
