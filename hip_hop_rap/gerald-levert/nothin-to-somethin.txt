Hey, what's up?

To all my ballers, shot callers, ha  
You know how we do  
We turned nothing into something

Look at how we livin' now, oh yeah  
Check out how we livin'now, oh

And turned it into something  
We took nothing  
And turned it into something  
Turned it into something

Look, we've got so much her together, babe  
You see we took nothing and turned it into something, oh  

We took nothing  
We turned it into something  
You and me together  
Check it out, lemme break it down  
We took nothing  
See one year of courting  
Two years of kissing  
Three years of fuckin'  
And four years of making love  
Said just you and me, you and me  
So that equals eternity, hey hey  

I know you feelin' me now, huh They said it wouldn't last  
Said it wouldn't last  

We took nothing  
See one year of courting  
Two years of kissing  
Three years of fuckin'  
And four years of making love  
Turned it into something  
That's you and me  
That's the way a love should be, yeah  
You and me did, you and G did  
Said we did, yeah  

We took nothing  
Look at what we did, look at we did  
Turned it into something  
We took all our tiny fingers and we put them together  
Turned it into something  
And we made up something so good, so sweet  
Everybody everybody wants it, everybody wants it  
We took nothing, nothing  
We took nothing  
Nothing, nothing, ah baby baby  

Ah, nothing, nothing  
Said we took nothing, me and you  
You and me, you and me baby  
Uh huh, uh huh
