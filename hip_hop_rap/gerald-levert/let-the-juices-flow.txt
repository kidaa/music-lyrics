You're not yourself 
Come on let me rub your back 
Kiss on your neck like I used to do 
See you're tense you gotta let go 

Chorus 
Won't you let the juices flow 
Flow on flow on flow on 
Won't you let the juices flow 
Flow on flow on flow on 

Girl let down your hair hve no fear 
I'm gonna take good care of you 
But you gotta open up show me some love
I'm sure that I an pull you through 

See there ain't nothin' wrong with 
Throwin' on some Luther or some 
Marvin Gaye 
Baby just relax you can reach climax 
Trust me girl don't tell me no 

Chorus 

Forget about the kids or what your ex- 
boyfriend did 
Tonight just let the feelings flow 
See we won't tell no one we had so 
much fun 
Keep it on the down low 

Put on your favorite dress or better yet 
Girl don't put on anything 
I'll leave it up to you what we're gonna 
do 
We can do it fast or slow 

Chorus 

See I wanna make you smile 
I wanna make it right 
Make you see the light 
Everday and night baby 

Give you all the things you need 
Never let you down always be around 
When you're feelin' down 
Make you scream and shout 

Chorus 

You just need to relax 
Let it flow through your body 
You got too much stored up inside 
baby 

Whatcha tryin' to hide baby 
Swallow your selfish pride 
Let me come inside baby 

Fade
