Say you gotta leave say you gotta go 
Say love and understanding 
Is what I fail to show 
I don't understand why you wanna leave 
I tried my best to please you 

And Girl you got to believe me 
I just want you to be happy Baby 
And if not with me I'll understand 
But for now just take my hand 
Let me give you 

Just a little something 
To remember me by 
Just a little something 
Before you say bye bye 

I never thought that our love would end 
this way 
Now you're packing your bags and you're 
leaving 
I hoped and prayed I'd never see this day 
I want you to leave me with a smile Baby 
So put down put down your bags and stay 
a while 
Let me give you 

Repeat 1 

Give me one last hug is that too much 
One last kiss I know you're gonna miss it Baby 
One last touch Baby you can't get enough Baby 
If you love me then think twice before you 
leave me 

Repeat 1 

Ad lib 
I'm down on my knees begging you please 
How am I suppoce to live without you 
Without you everything is gone 
Let me give you 

Repeat 1 

Ad lib 
I'm down on my knees begging you please 
I'm hurting I'm burning don't leave me Baby 
Let me give you something to remember 
I'm crying for you 
Let me give you something Baby
