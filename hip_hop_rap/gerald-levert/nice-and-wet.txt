Chorus I 
Prepare yourself turn off the phone 
And get in position 'cause baby it's on 
And it's on it's on 

Ain't nothing wrong 
With being soaking wet 
I know you're ready 
For the real deal 

Repeat 

It's a full moon and love is in the air 
Champagne is chilling strawberry 
bubble bath 
I go out of my way just to turn you on 
Forget about the tv and throw away the damn phone 

My silk pajamas the ones you really like 
Are pressed and ready 'cause tonight is 
your night 
So wear that perfume and that black 
negligee 
you don't have to wear nothing just 
have it your way 

Chorus II 
A night you won't forget 
come on gonna keep it nice   wet 
A night you won't forget 
Gonna keep it nice   wet 

Ain't nothing wrong 
With getting soaking wet 
I know you're ready 
For the real deal 

I know all the switches that turn you on 
So tonight is the night I'm going to flock 
them 
All night long my 
body's oh so hot 
You got me in a sweat 
and tonight I promise 
you 
I'll keep it nice   wet 

Chorus II 

I got feelings inside 
I really want to give 
I won't be too hard 
I know that you're 
sensitive 

Girl sit back and relax 
And I'll take you there 
Girl you got to get 
loose 
Why don't you let down 
your hair 

Chorus II 

Chorus I two times
