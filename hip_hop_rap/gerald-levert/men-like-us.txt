I know it's gonna take someone 
Who can understand you 
I know you're tired of all these men 
lying to you 
It's gonna take someone 
Who can really understand your needs 
I'm not tryin to be a player hater baby 
But you would be better off with me 

Chorus 
Cause men like us 
We won't let you down 
Cause men like us 
We all been around 
We've had it all 
Now it's time to settle down 
We all need someone 
We need someone to share this house 

Hanging in those clubs all night 
coming home late 
When it comes down to this love 
Baby I won't make you wait 
See no one really knows 
All the hell you been through 
Oh I swear to make it up to you baby 
cross my heart, hope to die 
Anything for you 

Chorus 

Said you spent most of your life searchin' 
Well baby now here I am 
Here to sweep you off you feet 
So baby take my hand, come with me 

Chorus 

Men like us Men like us 
Men like us Men like us 
Men like us Men like us
