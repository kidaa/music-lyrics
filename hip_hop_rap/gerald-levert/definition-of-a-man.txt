I don't know think that uh you should go 
through the change that you do 
I want to change things for the better 

He don't deserve your kind of love 
like the kind of guys like me need don't 
get enough of 
hanging out late with his friends 
always in your pockets spending you ends 
What I wouldn't do to be in his shoes 
he goes out his way to misuse you 
don't take much to share responsibilities 
he don't even care what kind of man is he 

You give him everything 
but get nothing in return 
whatever you need just teach me 
I ain't afraid to learn no 

Chorus 
Ill care for you be there for you I'll 
share with you 
I'll undersatnd I'll be your friend 
that's my definition of a man 
I'll care for you be there for you I'll 
share with you 
I'll undersatnd I'll be your friend 
that's my definition of a man 

You don't seem like you're satisfied 
he said that he changed but you know he lied 
I never been one to have a PHD 
cause I don't want nobody player hating on me 
I know a good thing when I see one 
I look in your eyes girl I see the sun 
girl let him go while you're ahead 
I should be the one sleeping in your bed baby 

Chorus 

See baby you should neve have to wear the same 
thing twice 
I'll buy you everything you like 
I'll go to the wall for you 
spend my last dime at the mall for you baby 
go downtown in more ways than one 
see a good mans job a good mans job 
is never never never never never 
never never never done baby 

Chorus
