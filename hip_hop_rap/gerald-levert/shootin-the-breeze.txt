It seems we never have time alone 
There's so much more to this love 
That we've known let's get away 

Just leave today forget our troubles 
Try to find some piece of mind 
Sky is the limit this time Baby 

Shootin' the breeze enjoying the weekend 
Taking it easy just you and me 
Shootin' the breeze enjoying the weekend 
Taking it easy just just you and me 

Can you imagine you and me alone 
Fulfilling our wildest dreams 
Baby come on I'll be your slave 
Your every wish is my command 

Come go with me in ecstasy 
Will be right at your hands how can you refuse 
We'll watch the sunset and count all the stars 
I'll be so happy to be where you are 

Repeat 1 two times 

Ad lib 

Repeat 1 two times 

Ad lib
