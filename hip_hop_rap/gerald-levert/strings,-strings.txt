[Intro] 
It's all about you now, baby 
Silly me, however you want it 
Strings, strings, or no strings 

Ain't no sunshine since you've been gone 
Only rain, pain, and cloudy days spent all alone 
If I could turn back time, I swear that it would be 
The way it was when I was down for you 
And you was down for me 

Let no temptations 
Get a hold of me 
Said as long as you take care of home 
Everything will be everything 
Apology after apology 
Girl I guess you stopped feelin' me 
No more, I love you, no jealousy 
Im ready to change 
Just dont leave me 

2 - Strings, strings or no strings 
Baby Ill do anything 
To get your love back 
There could be strings 
Or no strings attached 

Repeat 2 

Ooh baby, you once were committed 
But I guessed I changed your mind 
Im willing to admit it 
Girl I gave you a hard time 
I just dont want you to go 
Throw away the good things we shared 
Ill leave it to you how fast we move 
Girl I know you still care 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 
Repeat 2 

Tell me how do you want me? 
How do you need me? 
How do you want me babe? 
Im willing to change, change, oh 
I cant stand it here all by myself 
Looking at the walls, I need ya baby 
Oh baby I'm falling apart 

I'm the one who blew this good thing 
So tell me what you want me to do 
Im the one who blew this good thing 
Will there be strings, strings or no strings 

Repeat 3 until fade
