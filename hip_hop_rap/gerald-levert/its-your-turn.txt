Look I've been loving you for a long time 
never asked you for much just have a open mind 

For a year or so we been going strong 
I'll stop at nothing girl just to turn you on 
didn't I do it baby didn't I do it girl 
See I'll do anything just to make you scream 
tell me how low and girl I would go 
didn't I do it baby didn't I do it girl 

Chorus 
It's your turn to do unto me as I do unto you 
you got to show and prove that you like my groove 
I don't wanna be the only freak around 

Chorus 

Buy you what you need to get into me 
strawberries whip cream I'll get you some honey 
I would do that baby I would do that girl 
Watch a video turn on the radio 
what's it gonna take to start this freaky show 
are you 'bout it baby are you 'bout it girl 

Chorus 

If you're my girl and I'm your man 
you got to understand that I got needs baby 
And I ain't gonna tell a sound girl no no no 
no no nobody baby 
so let your hair down it's time to play 
turn on the music a little bit of Marvin Gaye 
let's get it on baby let's get it on girl 
if you don't I gotta go I gotta go baby 
said you get one, two, three strikes and you're out 
gotta let you go baby gotta let you go baby 
gotta let you go baby gotta let you go baby 
baby please don't let me down 
you get one, two, three strikes and you're out 

Repea four times 

Do unto me as I do unto you 
you got to show and prove that you like my groove 
I don't want to be the only freak around 

Chorus
