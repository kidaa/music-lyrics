[Intro]
I remember the old saying daddy used to say 
He'd say "Son, watch your back cuz misery loves company" 
I never understood what it meant 
'Till this happened 

She put you out with no place to go 
You call me up, and I came right on over 
Said you had a few problems 
You knew you were wrong 
Wanted to get yourself right 
So I let you stay at my home 

When I started peepin' you makin' eyes at my boo 
Goin' out your way to be all up in her face 
Me and her would be in bed doin' what we do 
Then I dunno where, she'd ask me things I only told you 

Misery loves company 
I thought you were a friend to me 
But right is right 
And wrong is wrong 
So pack your bags 
Brother, you on your own 
Step on step on step on 
Get to steppin' brotha' 
You're on your own 
Step on step on step on 

My man, my man, my brother, my homey yeah 
Step on step on step on 

A lesson learned, but told long ago 
Keep enemies close, but friends even closer 
Tell the truth 
See happiness breeds envy 
Don't ever say the words 
"It'll never, never, never, never happen to me" 

Oh cuz 
One day you'll close your eyes 
And then to your surprise 
You open them and see 
Somebody been all up in your cherry tree 
Then that'll be the day 
That you'll lose your mind 
Just spending time writing letters 
In a cell doing 20 to life 

Repeat 1 

Get to movin' homey 
Get to goin', boy 
You act like you don't know me 
Get your move on 
Oh no, no, no 

It's a low down dirty shame 
When your so-called friends start playin' games 
They know how to get to you 
All inside, all up in your business 
Start breakin' up your family too 
Your family took him in as one of them 
And as time gone by they don't even care 
No respect, they moved on 
And here comes jealousy 
But they had the same, the same opportunities as you do 
So you got to tell him, get to steppin' brother 
Cuz you ain't nothing, you ain't no good 
You ain't no good, you ain't no friend of mine 
Testify now, this evening 
Raise your hands this evening 
Said you was the one, you was my best friend 
You was my best friend 
You was my 
Brother, friend, homey through thick and thin 
Misery, misery, misery 
Brother, a friend, my homey through thick and thin 
Misery, misery, misery
