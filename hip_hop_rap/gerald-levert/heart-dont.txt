Heart Don't tell me I'm wrong again 
Cause that would be whack 
And I Don't want to be that 
Heart Don't tell me I'm wrong again 
Cause it wouldn't be fun 
I think I've found the right one yeah 

Not another gold digger 
It's just my luck, go figure 
The good ones always pass me by 
They always go to the next guy 
Or I always get the one 
Everybody else has done 
Give her everything, I keep her lace 
I must have sucker on my face 

What the deal is? 
I Don't deserve this 
When I met her she said 
She had her own apartment 
I believe her 
Tell me why is they always lying? 
It was her system 
She was kicked out for not paying rent 
And now all my money's spent 
So tell me 

Repeat 1 

Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Oh heart Don't tell me I'm wrong 

Not another Jazzy Belle 
Say is it so prey tell 
So she got a good game 
But playing with love just ain't my thing 
And maybe I should settle down 
And maybe start thinking 'bout
Giving her my name 
Ain it a shame love driving you insane 
Not another but I love her 
She remind me so much of my mother 
That can't be bad no 
Cause my fingers hope and lingers 
Hoping that I Don't have to look no further 
Cause I can't stand another heartbreak, no 

Repeat 1 2x 

Ah oh, ah oh, ah ooh 
Ah oh, ah oh, ah ooh, ooh 
Ah oh, ah oh, ah ooh 
Ah oh, ah oh, ah ooh, ooh 
I just want to get me a girl 
And dance all night long 
Dance all night long, long, long, long 

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 till end
