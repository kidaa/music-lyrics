[Intro] 
She was saying all the right things 
She was like a fashion show 
From head to toe 
Something came over me 
Something I couldn't see 
I said that four letter word 
L-O-V-E 

First time shoulda been the last time 
I shoulda stayed away 
Being in love wasn't my thing 
But uh oh, looks like another love TKO 
Bit off more than I can chew 
I done fell in love with you, yeah 

Look what I done stuck my foot in 
Turned around, fell in love again 
Hope love don't let me down 
Second time around 

Look what I done stuck my foot in 
Turned around, fell in love again 
Hope love don't let me down 
The second time around 

Oh, hope love won't let me down, no, no 
Second time around 
Second time around, second time around oh, no, no 

I don't mind calling your baby mine, yeah 
And I'll pay the bills 
You can spend your dough at will, yeah 
And it don't make sense 
Cuz you know I swore off the days, yeah 
But you're a rare precious jewel 
And I don't mind playing the fool for you 

Repeat 1 

Hey look what I done look what I done 
Second time around 
Stuck my foot in, yeah 
Look what I done done 

Baby I wasn't even chasin', I was being patient 
Me and my prostration, feet solid on the ground, yeah yeah 
Then you came around, came around came around 
Dealin' with the drama from my baby mama 
Tryin to keep my karma 
You were my only friend, I had to let you in 
Look what I done stuck my foot in 

Repeat 1 

I said I'd never love the sun no more 
Cuz the pain of breakin' up just make me so 
She'd never loved me quite the way you did 
God sent you to me and I'mma try it again 

My friends think I'm crazy 
Don't want me to forget 
That the first of every month 
I'm just writing out checks 
And checks and checks and checks 
I done fell in love baby 

Ad lib until fade
