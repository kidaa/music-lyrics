You know life is funny 
When you look at it everbody 
wants love 
and everybodys afraid of love 
I'm a firm believer that if you 
get anything out of love 
you got to put up witht he tugs 
and strive yeah 
you almost push our love a little 
bit too far 
we forgot to remember how bless 
we are 

And that girl over there telling 
you what she sees 
you don't have to worry she ain't 
gonna get next to me 
you told me to think it over and 
I thought it over 
and over and over over and over 
you see 'cause 

Chorus 
That's the way I feel about you 
That's the way I feel about you 
That's the way I feel about you 
That's the way I feel about you 

I know you've been hurt so have 
many of us too 
that's a sacrifice life is gonna 
put you though 
trust in me like I trust in you 
sometimes I look at you baby 
And wonder if God sent you here 
don't take my love as a sign of 
weakness
check into the situation it gets 
a litttle deeper 
told me to think it over and I 
thought it over 

Chorus 

Please, please, please answer to love 
if it ever come knocking at your door 
'cause what's out there knocking baby 
the world don't get enough of 
I know you've been hurt so many have 
many of us too 
That's a sacrifice that life is gonna 
put you through 
don't take my love as a sign of a weakness 
check into the situation it gets a little 
deeper and deeper 
you told me to think it over and I thought 
it over 
you think it over baby 

Chorus
