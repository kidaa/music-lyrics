Ha! Ha!
A queen is not a queen, because she is felt
But a queen is a queen, because failure has not stopped her
Take it from me, the queen of all queens
WOMEN, are taking over for the new millennium
Oww!

What the hell do you want from me
I'm just tryin to be all that I can be
I'm a god damn legacy
Thanks to B.I.G. and Puff Daddy
The first lady runs the world now
They impeached the president from his residence
No one drops bombs til I say so
One-two, one-two-three GO!

[1] - I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals

How dare you accuse me and my family
Fucking clones, LEAVE US ALONE!
Me and Puff is like Janet and Mike
You make us wanna "Scream," know what I mean
Yeah, yeah; I know y'all rather see us dead
No more platinum plaques certified lead
We got too many chips for y'all
Queen Bee, Queen Bee make hits for y'all
Take a breath, inhale, exhale till there's no more left
In the name of the father, son, and daughter
Here comes the new world order!
You can't stop it
Mother Earth this my universe
When worse comes to worse Uh-huh
I call the shots Uh-huh, stack all the lots Uh-huh
Pack all the glocks, take the safety off lock FIRE!

[Repeat 1]

La, la, la sing!

Can I jingle it baby Go ahead baby
Can I jingle it baby Go ahead baby HMM
Take it out let me sit on it
If you can't make it wet just spit on it
Ah don't stop till it rise to the top
Promise you won't drop till the cherry go *POP*
And if it doesn't fit then use your lips
Oh here it comes, what's my name
QUEEN BITCH

[Repeat 1]

La, la, la, la

[Repeat 1 till end]
