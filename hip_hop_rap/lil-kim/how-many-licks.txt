Hold up 
So what you're saying is, oh 
Niggaz got me pissed like Lil' Kim 
You want to get freaky again, aight 
A-ooh-ah-ooh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 

[Lil' Kim] 

I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces 
Ah hell I even fuck with different races 
A white dude - his name was John 
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm, uh 
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom 
and he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm 
Dan my nigga from Down South 
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth 
And Tony he was Italian Uh-huhAnd he didn't give a fuck Uh-huh 
That's what I liked about him 
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin 
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin 
Puerto Rican papi, used to be a Deacon 
But now he be sucking me off on the weekend 
And this black dude I called King Kong 
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue 

[Sisqo] 

So, how many licks does it take till you get to the center of the

This verse goes out to my niggaz in jail 
Beatin they dicks to the double-X-L; Magazine uhh 
You like how I look in the aqua green 
Get your Vaseline 
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes 
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs {*Moans*} Baby.. ohh.. yes ohh! 
Jailer.. open up.. cell, block, eight 

{*sexual sounds*} 

Alright nigga, that's enoughStop, look and listen; get back to your position 
Kim got your dick hard, startin fights in the yard 
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster 
Niggaz do anything for a Lil' Kim poster 
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs 
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know 

[Sisqo]

[Lil' Kim] 

If you drivin in the street, hold on to your seat 
Niggaz, grab your meat while I ride the beat 
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya 
Shoom! That's me the Knight Rider 
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap 
Lunatics in the street - gotta keep the heat 
Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings 
Sittin pretty baby with a Cash Money bling 
12 A.M. I'm on the way to club 
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck 
Some niggaz even put me on their grocery lists 
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates 
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors 
High-class taste niggaz got to spend paper 
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over 
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial
