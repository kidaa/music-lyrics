I need you, got to have you
Yeah whatever

I was sitting at the bar
When this real horny guy came over
Hi how are you doing How are you
He said won't you let me take you
On a ride in my Range Rover
I said you can't be serious
My Bentley's right outside
Plus your breath smells like shit anyway

[1] - Oh I need you, oh
Gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah
Right now

Everybody's on the dance floor
And this fool is still behind me
I am dipping through the crowd now
Hoping that he doesn't find me
He said baby where you going
Lil' Kim I love you
Then he grabbed me by the hand
And dipped my body to the ground
And said

[Repeat 1]

Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Dut-dut-dut-dut
Dut-dut-dut-dut
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut

See the party don't stop till the casket drop
Like a six double O with the plastic drop
Damn is that all you got
Hmm baby give it one more shot
Got a body like what-what
Watch me shake my butt, butt-butt
Like it when you sing that song, oh
I know you wanna see my thong

[Repeat 1]

Right now, right now
I need your love baby
I need your love baby
