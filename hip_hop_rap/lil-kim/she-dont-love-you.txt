[dials phone - phone rings]

[Kim] Hello
[Girl] Hello
Is this Lil' Kim
[Kim] Who's this
[Girl] Don't worry 'bout all that
I found your number in my man's pocket
[Kim] Well shit bitch!
Give it to him then!
No wonder the mothafucka hasn't call me yet!
Look at your fuckin' groupie ass
Stealin' numbers and shit
[Girl] Wha Fuckin' bitch!
I'mma see your ass at the mothafuckin' concert

[Kim]
Does she do it like me
Does she work that body
Throw that ass like pu-pump-pump-pu-pump that hottie
Do she handle it like she got a deep throat
I mean suck that cock 'til she start to choke
Does she like to have sex high off the X
Try it with me and tell me who's the best
Does she like to wear thongs that you can eat
Do she fuck your brains out 'til you fall asleep

[1] - Bet you she don't fuck you
Like you know I fuck you
And I bet you she will never do, oh
All the things I'll do for you

Is she drop-dead fine
Does she like it from behind
Is she fly
Do she got a style like mine
Does she slurp it, rub it, jerk it, ride it
Tell you how you feel when you inside it
You love me, and I know she know
Cuz everytime I come around, she be like "let's go"
Girls know not to leave they man around me
I get my hands on 'em
He puttin' rent and a Benz on me

[Repeat 1]

I'm the queen of Rap, there is none higher
Did she tell you that
The bitch is a liar
People spend doe to see me spit fire
And niggas give they life to be with me for one night
I let you come in me, while you stick it in the booty
Lick the nut off, then stick it back in the coot, see
I bet you she don't even know how to kiss
And I bet you ain't never been fucked like this

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

And I bet ya, and I bet ya baby
And I bet ya she don't fuck you
And I bet ya, bet ya, bet ya baby
And I bet ya she don't fuck you
No, baby

[Repeat 1 to fade]
