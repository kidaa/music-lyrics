Baby I missed you
I missed you to.
I waited a long time for this.
So why you aint come see me, no commisary or nuttin.
I aint wanna see my bird in no cage.  But im ready to take care of you now.
Now, after three years, three muthafuckin years, nigga you know what

[gun cock]

Hasta la vista, bye bye, kiss ya kid
its the gangstrasis, what u think this is nigga
calm yourself, its just a little robbery
you got strickin with the poverties callin me
call me sunshine, pussy spread like the rainbow,
spectaculous, miraculous
i practice this for a livin like the budhism
yom yom rain ge ki
ask tina, nuttin got shit ta do with me and you
or the 44 under the pillow
what the deal do, i like to play while im workin
and thats for certain, keep jerkin, i aint done with you
lights, camera, curtains, in a second
the show begins, invite your family and friends
they gots ta see this or they wouldnt believe this,
u got stuck and left naked with a hard penis.

[chorus x2]

It dont take nuttin for you to love me baby
it dont take nuttin for you to love me
if you're feelin like i do then i know you want it too
it dont take nuttin for you to spend a little doe.

i heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
out on me, by your man big d
stink gucara i bought his life for 3 g's
then some watches, then wet him like galoshes
no need to be mad they already gone,
him and your hit man had somethin going on
we caught him done at the Shark Bar up in Mark's car
you know the place where the willies are
always frontin in they 
sippin dom p's and cristies
i remenesce how it used to be
on the run from police we bust shotties
out of mazaradi's
bloodie bodies in the telly lobbies
when in need i lie for you, cry for you
you know this down ass bitch woulda died for you.

[chorus x2]

and i remember, how u said u loved me
with a passion, high fashion, who u askin
to keep the tum numb, from index to thumb,
push the v's with the coke from the dt's
dont take the titties from city to city
i aint seen a g off none of key's
at ease, when the cops came u gave them my name
said if i didnt snitch you'd make a shorty rich
bitch i copped the one to three just to see
if all the yay o and boy carryin on the p
to maryland was worth the bitch marryin
this nigga i worked so hard for
choose my life to be hardcore
lost in the field no more
that i couldnt feel no more
and now im the shit
go by the name of little kim the queen bitch
and mafia's the click,
instead of playin don dinero
i shoulda been schemenin on your cream and dinero
dont pay to be nice but its nice to pay
and if u die before u wake may your soul god take.

[chorus x2]
