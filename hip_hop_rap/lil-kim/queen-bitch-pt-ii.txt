Beotch!
Come on, yeah
Uh, uh
He-he y'all ain't ready
Come on now, turn me up a little bit

Every thing you heard
Yo that's my word
You play the herd
And repeat every word
It get on your nerves
To see how we swerve
Watches that shine
Dimes with his and her furs
Straight from the curb
To the suburb
In the black suburb
Plucking birds, getting served
Y'all ain't never learned
How this world turn
Thought it was over, huh
Now we returned!
To whom it may concern
When you're hot you burn
Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Or it just ain't your turn
The rules also stern
Nigga get what you earn
And we still move in silence
Nigga ya heard

[Lil' Kim]
Y'all know who y'all are
Wanna battle
Better call an end to all that shit
You legit Spit a bar
What See I won the show
Got the illest flow
Finding loads of bank rolls in my underclothes
It's the original
And everybody know
I rock diamonds that's red, white and indigo
I'm undroppable, untoppable
You can't hold me down
Don't you know I'm unstoppable
Niggas wanna run up in my pussy like a Pap smear
I'mma tell you know, just like I told you last year
Niggas ain't stickin' unless they lick the kitten, huh
Too many bitches just be licking the dick and
And I'm a picky one I like my dicks rock hard
Not the sticky ones that taste like slaw
Oh something missing
The shower pissing
All up in your mouth
What You think I'm kidding
Cause everything we do
That's right
We got a right to
Come on
You criticize me we despise you
If what they say is true
We the baddest crew
I'm far from broke
So why should I be mad at you

You must be out your mind
Or you must be high
Fucking with the Teflon bitch from the Sty

The way I rock you to sleep like a lullaby
Oh yeah and by the way
You got one more day
All you got to pay boo you got something to say
Yeah bring it on bitch
You ain't strong bitch
Thought you'd be around long
Wrong bitch
Got nothing but love
But when push comes to shove
We turn to thugs
And we put on them gloves
Commence to licking slugs

More bags zipping up
Fake thug, nigga what
