Verse One: Lil' Kim

Blessed by the God, so I be the Earths
Queen Bee Bitch, Poppa keep my rich
In gun tottin', keep floatin' in them automobiles
Pack with steel, engines filled with Benjamins
I got half a mill stashed in the boat station
For womenizers and a hand full of hoes that hate me
But lately, it seems pople make the world go round
From A's to Z, I break 'em down alphabetically
Pethtically, I puts the pressure
In ya Jones that you fall Motorol burner
Flip ya jacks and ya snitch ass back, to the cell of your block
HDM lock, and I wish you would stop
All that baulin'!, cryin'! .....lyin'!
Cause this black Queen is shinin', you didn't know I was Lieutenant
Bitch, well that's primary
You just a secondary secretary, envy against me
Because I stay laced in Ellen Tracey, Dolce   Gabanna
And people love me for my style, my personal
Niggas got wow, and once I have my chow
Bet I just sit back and enjoy, the optimism given from a girl to a boy
that's what it's all about

chorus Mona Lisa

It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on

yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. click
yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. click

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

We all know what it means to be broke, breaking niggaz off
For some ends and weed smoke, some like to mix it with coke
Trees I like 'em fine, straight up marijuin'
And I'm put the lent in ya dents
Then you'll be stressed out with no dollars and no cents
Dressed in gear from last year, that you bought
Before you quit ya job at the airport
Thinkin' you gon' make a mill from this rap game
But you labeled as a lame and it's a damn shame
No fame, no name, show no shame
Who's to blame tore up in ya frame
Now you wanna lick a shot cause you ain't got
Get props, runnin' up in weed spots
Just a little gets to make game make the game
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash
Quick fast, get mad
Cause ya man's in my whip, honey button ya lip
Cause my click is too dense, it's all about the guns, the ones
Just another day that the Earths used the Suns

chorus Mona Lisa

It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
