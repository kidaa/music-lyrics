Ladies, gentlemen, gangsta's and killers
I'd like to welcome yall to this Terror Squad thriller
Staring me Joe Crack the realist
and ma you can get a seat, forget what ya friends have seen
They tell you please he's a celebrity
He ain't tryin' to start something
He is into menage crushin'
But she ain't tryin' hear nothin' fears nothin'
But her impulse is scared money dont make nothing
Plus she love the way the cashmere touch em'
How the lights bounce off the ice
This dude here is frontin
But you love it though
Everybody in hea know
A million niggaz tried to holla
A million niggaz wasn't Joe
I see you across the club the way you move ya body slow motion wit me
Dip it low n put ya body in the roles with me
Forget ya problems n sit bak n roll through the tolles with me
Now listen to the R flow with me

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Now we don't need no room keys because we up off in my jeep
Doing things to make us hot
to recline on these soft leather seats
Girl you got my emotions up
n now we beat it up
Touchin n feelin on each other
Now im like wats sup
Now break the doors
Lets roll lets roll come on
Lets hit the club lets roll lets roll come on
We got the cute chicks, party chicks, stripper chicks
We got the money chicks, good chicks, hot chicks
We got the V.I.P. poppin bottle model chicks
We go the ride or die down for what ever chicks
We gonna do it up in here till around six
n we gonna be puffin on that L till around six
n yes I fuck with this colabo cuz it's magic
Kells, Terror Squad, Joe still thuggin

[Chorus]
