Double R baby, D Block
Joe Crack this is history

Who got the most cars, most guns, most bitches
And I don't gotta pull the trigga I just blow kisses
Niggaz love Jada that hate rap
Upstate tryin to get they weight back
Bout to go to k-sack
Cause I made niggaz believers
My voice my flow that helped your faggot ass get in the league
And I ain't gotta suck dick to sell records
get all outta caracter  and scream and yell reckless
Listen to me; I'm the cat that'll sit in a tree
And shoot the dog in the head while he shittin and pee
And I'm just so cool; I prally could snatch Trini
from Usher in a club in Atlanta wit no jewels
You always was puss you never was hard
You know who it is Ruff Ryders and Terror-the-squad
And make sure you remember this
My lifestyle remix; 'Kiss, Joe Cracks and Remi-nisce

[Chorus]
Y'all wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crack house
Wanna war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on and I'ma show you gangsta
[reapeat]

[Fat Joe]
Hoddie down wit the mac
Boggie down where it's at
Fuck around hear the sounds of these gats
Wanna clown? we react come on fuck dat
Don't you know what you do when you fool wit Joey Crack
I'm still the realest  y'all just pretend that you
Claim to do shit that we don't remember
Always thinkin that you running the streets
Now I'ma leave you leakin under a sheetwhat
Fuckin with Joe Crack is costly
No gat can off me
They learned that when I sold lacks at 4th street
A few dudes crippleanother 2 vegi
Its more than obvious this terrorsquad crew deadly
What could we do to stop it?
everything new he cop it
convertable blue 6 before you knew they drop it
And even if they didn't wellyou would just assume he choped it
My lifestyle the shit man it's truly poppin

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Remi Martin]
yea yea yea
I catch you backstatge you already know whats gon happening
Ain't gon be no applaud just a whole lotta clappin
You can't live my lifestyle lemme catch yor ass rappin
First bitch to spit a verse first bitch that I'm slappin
Tell me how these clowns gon laugh at me
When I'm flyin pass the ass pushin a pourch to it's capacity
you see me where ever joey crack be
pretty have niggaz sick like oh shit thas remi ?
Yup Straight gangsta what straight music
all that hype about your album and it ain't even do shit
You might have a gun but you sure don't use it
And if givin the opurtunity you prally wouldn't even shoot it
I'm the bitch in this rap shit so fuck all you wack chicks
I'm directin this movie and your just an actress
They wanna what?

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
