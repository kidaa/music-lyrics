[27 second skit opens song telling Pablo his sister is dead]

[Chorus: 'Pablo']
Joe Crack's that nigga
I'll crack that nigga, hold THAT lil' nigga
I'm from the, BX borough, you ain't gon' miss tomorrow
If you know like I know you know you'll get hit with them hollows, sayin

[Fat Joe]
Raindrops are fallin on my hood again, hood again
Niggaz is talkin in the hood again, hood again
Yeah niggaz wanna act live
I got that 9 that kill more than just time
They say they can't stand him, but just yesterday
I was chillin on the block in the Phantom
And ain't nobody smirk my way - nope - keep speakin that hot shit
and you can get merked today, check me out
There's some rumbling on the blocks, struggle on the streets
That's why I had to leave that bitch bloody in them sheets
Go 'head and think Crack just rap
Fuck around I'm gon' really have to clap these cats
I hear 'em talking that

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Fat Joe]
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin 'em go
I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
If I don't know you boy I'm lettin 'em go
I tried tell you boy I'm lettin 'em go
Your momma warned you boy that I ain't no joke
I'm tired of talkin boy I'm lettin 'em go

['Pablo']
Does Crack think he live
Just because he had poppin in '88 and his boys served time
I don't care 'bout that neither
I don't give a fuck about him, T.S. or the fever
Yeah I said it, when I see him I'ma pop him
I know he big but this here 9 gon' stop him
I'm in the streets everyday in these projects
I ain't scared nigga, man I'm dyin to get it poppin

[Chorus + Interlude]

[Fat Joe]
Pussies loose these days, gotta tighten 'em up
Think they comin of age 'til you lighten 'em up
Momma screamin cause you lyin in dust, I ain't lyin
Who the fuck you think supplyin the drugs?
I'm your boss that's boss, pretty much I bought you that Porsche
And pretty much I'm 'bout to auction you off
to the highest clapper, get your head spun backwards you bastards
For thinkin Terror Squad just rappers, we'll blast ya
You lil' niggaz ain't even in my lane
Who you know nicknamed after 'caine?
Yeah I'm goin to hell, but I'm sendin you first
Muh'fuckers think they tough 'til them canisters burst
I know you hear my niggaz

[Chorus + Interlude]
