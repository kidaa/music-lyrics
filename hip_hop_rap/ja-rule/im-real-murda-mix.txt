feat. Jennifer Lopez

[Jennifer Lopez Ja Rule]
What's my motherfuckin name
R-U-L-E
Blowin back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggaz and pussy hoes, it's one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only Man that help is above me, holla

I met so many men and
It's like their all the same
My appetite for lovin
Is now my hunger pain

And when I'm feelin sexy
Who's gonna come for me
My only problem is
Their insecurity

[1 - Jennifer Lopez Ja Rule]
Tired of bein alone Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin on the phone Yeah, yeah
Are you tellin all your friends Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand My love

[2 - Jennifer Lopez Ja Rule]
Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Ja Rule]
Girl, I've been thinkin bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets
Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin at me, smilin at me, laughin like we wasn't happy
But not knowin that we're growin and we're gettin married
Hard lovin and straight thuggin
Bitch, I ain't doin this shit for nuttin
I'm here to get it poppin, hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin in the wind, sun glistenin off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Repeat 2]

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin me and hatin me, treatin me ungratefully
But not knowin that they ain't makin or breakin me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

Now people screamin what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas, mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

[Repeat 1]
