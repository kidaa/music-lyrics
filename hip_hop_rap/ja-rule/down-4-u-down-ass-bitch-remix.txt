[Chorus: Ja Rule] + Ashanti
I wanna be your chick
I wanna be down for you
Do you trust me? Yea Love me? Yea
U puttin' it on me? You must be
Your down ass chick
I wanna be your chick
And only for the Rule Baby I'll ride for you
Yea Die for you
Yea Do anything you want me to
I'll be your down ass chick

[Ja Rule]
Yo, this is no intention
To being offensive to women
By calling y'all bitches
My down ass bitches
Still, my queen bitches
Cuts look clean on the finger
Next to that finger you flipped at me
And there's no in between me and you
Only me and you
Who else gon put it on ya like the Rule
And God only looks after children and fools
And you're not so who gon' look after you?
Rule baby

[Vita]
True baby, it's only for you baby
Vita's thighs only divide if you inside
Cuz I love the way you touch me
Nobody can get it
And if it's comin or gunnin
Just considered it's spitted
So when you gone for a minute
I just fantasize
Like if it's you that's all in it
Then I'm satisfied til you come back to me
Holdin' stacks and jewels
V-I-T-A and my nigga J-A Rule Baby

[Chorus]

[Ashanti]
I'm gonna be here when you need me
Rule baby, can always count on me
And you don't ever have to worry
You know I'll make it in a hurry
Here for you and I will never leave
Shed tears fou you, cuz boy, you got to me
There will never be another for me
You'll always be my one and only

[Ja Rule] Baby girl, would you bust your gun wit me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] Lie to the Feds if they come get me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] If I die, would you kill for me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] Are you trustin me?
[Ashanti] Yea, Yea
[Ja Rule] Are you lovin me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea, yea

[Ja Rule]
Yea, let's get it gwenin' like we Ashford and Simpson
Or Ike and Anna Mae on one of they good days
You smile like smile rays 5'5 with brown eyes and thick legs
Only for the Rule baby

[Chorus]

[Charli Baltimore]
Now baby, I told you I can show you
Better than I can tell you
Blow trial, bring commissaries and mail
You them sweet words and naked force
I'm still that pretty down down ass 2 cars behind your 6
And not just any clown ass
Glockin my round ass only a down ass
And it's all for you
I grown a tad bit
Since we been at it like rabbits
The booty lil plumper and it's...

[Ja Rule] All for Rule

[Charli Baltimore]
Shit, who gon love you like that?
Thug with you with it stacked to the ceiling
Or splittin a dub with you
Cuz I play my position with cold D's and O.G.'s
Until that blood shed, blood red, or we OD'd
Remember every word that you told me?

[Ja Rule]
Show me, hold me

[Charli Baltimore]
All you need in your life is Chuck, drugs, and dubs
And 22's now tell me who the honey for you?
Chuck

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
