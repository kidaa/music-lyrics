Who buy my records supporting all my dogs
When I'm in your town
Can I pub crawl with ya'll
Go back home with your
Silky drawers baby doll
Exodus insanus nocturnus
Never your clan cannot learn us
Ya'll dead cold and I'm a furnace
With hella hot burners
I vibe like no other man when
I'm in another land
Use a rubber band
I don't love her man
Bell till I bail ride till I die
Yes I'm that gang related nigga yellin' why
Haters find it hard for them to see
How hard nina be
Tell me who you came to see

Get your ass on the dance floor
You lazy bitch
In order to bring the bread cream in
I got to keep them heads ringin'
You trip and you's a dead demon
No spread semen leavin'
Groupies on the bed dreamin'
Her newlywed steamin'

For this punk spit one for this punk
Villain I ain't bought
To have ta run from this punk I dump
Nigga what I keep it crunk
And cranked lumps in banks

[3rd Verse]

You better blow that shit out
If it ain't greeny green
Better throw that shit out
Kind of funny
How I come nina stun niggas
Out of money
Then I run with a gun trigger
Get us in a club killer
When I am in it
Women give us love with 'em
I'm a damn menace
We keepin' it hot
Don't cock the glocks
If you came to make it hop
You're at the spot drop
We smoke weed
And we drink rum up teccanina
Sex we don't stop till
We bust nut teccanina
Ain't no change in me
Ain't no sugar veins in me
Ain't no petty kiddy games in me
If you're with me
And ain't ashamed to be
Flamed with me
Tell 'em tell 'em
Who ya who ya came ta came ta see see

[Chorus]

Who been that mystery
What's my name

And what you gain from me is pain from me
Tell me who you came to see
