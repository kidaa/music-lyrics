I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin' brain
Deteriorating cause of x pill poppin' I got
More troubles what ever you got it doubles
And triples and quadruples having fantasies of eating
Nipples and noodles

Drugs take the pain away, used to have a lot of love
But now it fade away
The fact that women love the music and they open
Their legs 4 a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the
Head is beautiful

For my family this isn't suitable devil bitches alert
No gotta recruit a few this niggas gonna do me
Harm I'm drugged up and I'm torn look at this
Mutha fucker he colored my hair orange

You can't touch me everybody loves me listening to my
Music children are getting ugly. If I told you everything
I was thinkin' it wouldn't be G. tellin' you how many
Crossed my path just wouldn't be me

But they know cause they way lo how bout some ex
And fry and ya yo and fuck a ha hlo a lot of Jim Beam
To have grim dreams would be healthy I'm trapped
In a psychos body can you help me?

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4 times Backwards]
