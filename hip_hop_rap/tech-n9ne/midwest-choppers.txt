Welcome to misery where the killers pop it up
Whenever I say it and deal it at the turn of the gun
We can do it if anybody want it
Where the rapper niggas will call up and tell everyone
Misery loves company so we done with thee
Enemy where he be energy sendin me the route
My negativity trippin wit me you runnin fo yo life
Cause you ran your mouth MOUTH

[CHORUS]
We can sang or we can bang
It ain't no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain't no thang - MIDWEST CHOPPERS

And it's a shame that you came and got drained
And listen mayn stay in your lane - MIDWEST CHOPPERS

[CHORUS]

We be the best We ain't talking about women we be talking about paper
Already made come and terrible
And the competition is the killa
With or with the buretta tight right under my sweater
And we hide it delopta be where my killas
But my dealers are betta
Like a blender leeroy like a guillotine
Chop yo hands out and throw me out the window

Watch yo lyrical
Thru the atp
WHEN WE COME TO THE STREET WE DON POST ON THE BLOCK
For the killa I'ma lift my middle finger up to the cop
So On the way to the studio we be makin another hot track
They be lovin the way we spit it
Boy they want our position but they ain't never get it
In the hone of the pacific
We the definiton of a soldier
My opposition is the cultural
I spit like a tomic
Me and my killa are guerillas

Boy we tryin to battle cuz they want our position
But they ain't never get it
Man I told you
We the number one competitors dealin
Working the way to the top and get the millin
In the hone of the city you can never cross us

You can try to read us
You can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up but it ain't gon matter
Cause after were done bustin a nigga we don after
We takin after techa nina is the master

[CHORUS]

Whenever I'm reppin the city in the cane
Holla your brain cuz I'm a disaster
Dilemma get ready decibel comin atcha

Hands down now I popped ya now
Lets take a trip to the back of your real gear
Strange the individual wit ill skill

When you get out of the truck spittin off the crane

Cause whenever I'm bustin its like
The full heart stopper
The techa nina get up the flow cause we

[CHORUS]

Hit you with the lyrical lyrical miracle whip incredible knock the head like a several
Diggy diggy down diggy down watcha diggy down
Cook it clown and at the house hold it down diggy diggy__ diggy down
And if you look for the sound you can be found
With the nigga in the crowd are you really wit me?
And when you hear it then nigga then zip it
These make you want to reposition and pivit
When we write it and spit it we makin somebody get it
And if they wont hear it then they wont get it, STOP
Oh we can keep babblin on
Or rapplin off at the mouth while we travelin
And we speakin on on the speakin on the things we be doin comin in to pop my mouth
And where the hell were u?
And I can stop with the drop

And I wont hesitate to chop you

And if you throw me past the pack man you get it
