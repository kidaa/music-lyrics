[1st Verse]

One
And then comes the two
To the three
And four
Two-thousand Techa N9na
Is hardcore
With a K
See me step up on the track
Like a thug
Make it pound
At West end
Then make a dub
To the homies in jail
When you making bail
Time to act an idiot
A lot
Not just a little bit
Watch when Kansas City hit
Tech N9NE's gonna
Spit it
You want this record
Cool
Go get it
Hot when the flame's lit
Gloc where the bane sits
Shock when the pain quits
Pac would've banged this
Instantaneous
When I aim at the miscellaneous
Ask me ask ask why why
I'm the strangest
Because
Nobody ever wanted me rapping
But I knew within me
I could make it happen
Flipping hella different
To get it cracking
Never biting nothing
I was never jacking
Millimeter spitting
Ripping up a show
And got the people trippin'
Everywhere we go
And now we getting
You to know that misery
Is coming
We were summoned
Now the haters running
When we gunning
Yo
You don't know
That I'm 'bout to blow
K C M O
Better bang this
People make there jokes
And say we're off to see the wizard
Well me and Dorothy
And Toto's on your ass
When you visit

[Hook]

It's alive
Aw hell
It's alive
Dod Gwamn
It's alive
Odd Male
It's alive
I am
Been in the dark a minute
But now I made it through it
This Kansas City
Imma show you how we do it.
We say walla milli dollar
Then break a lot a jaw

[2nd Verse]

Who would bust like
My style it's ruffcut
And it's
True hood stuff
Bright hot wild mystic
Plus mannish
Alien nation
Invasion
Black White and even Asian
Is gazing
At the raised
In misery faze ravin'
For the crazed heaven
Six six
Triple eight
Forty-six
Ninety-nine three
We back
Sick with nickel plates
Whorey chicks
Mighty mine be
We pack
Just when you're knowing
Where I'm gonna be
I vanish
Step into my brain
Got it so dark
That you can't see
Godd dammit
Your flows come in
Your flows go out
My flows eternally
Coming out your mouth
Your makers in
Some haters doubt
And yes it's pitiful
Not even pinnacle
Better know when I bust
I can do it everyday
With a mind full of lust
If you really must
Get with a N9NE millimeter gun
Then trust
You'll get left in the dust
Everybody better move
When I groove
Imma hit 'em with a bus
Anybody with a bigger mouth up in here
Better hush

[Hook]

It's alive
Aw hell
It's alive
Dod gwamn
It's alive
Odd male
It's alive
I am
Been in the dark a minute
But now I made it through it
This Kansas City
Imma show you how we do it

[3rd Verse]

Kansas City City City
That's where I really wanna be
Grime and gritty gritty gritty
Back up when I throw that V
Up in the air air air
That's five seven R D V
And you know nare nare nare
That'll represent
Like me
Yo we did it in Kansas City
Yo we did it
Like Biggie say
Much love
My left mind
Said Tech N9NE is Iggy J.
You can find me
Off in Kansas City on Saturday
At Maniax
Or at the Motel 6
Laying up with two chicks
The Lenny and Squiggy way
Or Jack
Tripper
I'm Tech the rap
Ripper
On Cognac
Liquor
I'm Tech the gat
Clicker
I'm up on that
Thicker
Than water track
A whipper snap
Who's trying to bring
Tony Kannedy
Del Shawn
And Chipper back
Signing off
Rhyming off
The wall constantly
Timing off
Never that
Clever raps the comp can't be
Creeping
Seeping through the crevices
Hella beefing
Thinking they can stop
The heart of Kansas City
But the heart of Kansas City
Is beating

[Hook]
