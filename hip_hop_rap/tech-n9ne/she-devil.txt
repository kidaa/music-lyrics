[Chorus]
Sin with me I want you. She-devils in the house let me hear ya

Shocked when the notch sold crotch and you lost composure
Soft for the ho's ya not stocked fulla roll ya walk for the
Hot shot wanna cop and do lots of dosha

She devil her greed level is hella high
Speed rebel exceed pedals with a devils eye
They call girl and strip they all twirl and trip in yaw world

Hustlers they sluts and drug smugglers
Money they double up throw that stuff up and bubble up
Best believe when I get ya I'm bout to strap it down

That's why I'm paying you 150 bucks
To suck me and caniver
Let this diabetic dick touch your saliva

I take em blid and crazy 14 to 48
Every since we fucked I been coughing and losing weigh stink ho
Trying to creep bitch pick your son up
He been at school for a week

You fucking freak trying to get the best of me
Kidnap you ass leave you lost like really without destiny
You stank trick you suck dick Jason Williams
What up! Shoot this dirty bitch

[Verse 3]
This devilish bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time that I bust a nut
She's like a succubus a nymphomaniac laying me back
On a fitchy mattress cum stinking smelling like catfish

Still I hit yeah I did it her pussy travels it doesn't have a pivet
I remember when she was timid your scandalous ass
Taking the pastors cash got em on the sucking your tits
Snorting and passing hash

I still had to grab that ass had to laugh at stories
About you ragged ass-licking maxi pads, you dirty bitch
You used to be nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fuck thirty pits

[Verse 4]
Now besides being on ex and regardless of having sex
We getting close to gellets just grinding to every kick
2 fingers up in her pussy my hands rubbing her tits
As soon as my wife push me her mans fucking a trick

I don't care she know I trick but she's starting to get hip
To it cause she's finding matches inside of my pockets
That say I strip which means I might get caught lose
Everything that I bought, the house, the kids, and the car I know it sounds Bizarre

But we should give her a call and see if she want it in that way
It's 3-way sex and we can all be friends
I know you've done it before don't act like you haven't whore
I'm bout to lose my wife I can't afford a divorce

[Verse 5]
Fucking with your pussy it's a handful you think
I'm drowning then you clowning
So basically bitch you're a damn fool and that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young I could see 100 niggas thru your gap

And all of them was probably hitting that
That's embarrassing you're stuck with 30 children, 20 miscarriages
In and out of buildings aint caring who it is fucking newlyweds
Didn't mean to do it but you did slut

[Verse 6]
Devilish she's never to be faithful
Credit or fee it's better that she's tranquil
Even a apple my cock can unlock
The key to your asshole

Stop the plot do the freeze on my cash flow
Cock the gloc I thru these in the castle
Fresh outta school with a disease and a tassle
Ski's and it's natural you just my ho that's the reason you stack dough
