[1st Verse]

One for the devil, two for my God
Father please forgive me while I rock this broad

Invented

Feels lovely
Pink or brown without even with fuzz
They love me
All up on me off up in the club
Addicted
Gotta get her off in the room get her out them
panties Get wicked
Get her in the bed real quick get hit with a
whammy
Can't shake it
Try to pass it by but homey I
Can't make it
If it was non-existent I would die
Stay with me
I don't want to ever let it go
A quickie
Beat it down like I'm Riddick Bo
Real stiffly
We can do it fast or even slow
I'll lift thee
Up on the bed or on the floor
Obsessed with
Pussy coochie nani on my mind
God bless it
