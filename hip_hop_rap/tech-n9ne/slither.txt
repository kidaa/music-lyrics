[Intro]
It was a Friday night and me and my homeboys
Decided to celebrate our departure from JCOR
So you know us, we had to go to the strip clubs
Everybody said they wanted to go to DJ's so we did.

So we get up in DJ's and we got V.I.P.
The owner shows us a lot of love, so he takes us
To our seat and Trav orders a round of 151 and coke
4 all of us, and that's when I seen her

A stallion ass like pow, Chest like bang,
Lips like ew, an angel man but she had the devils eyes,
I had to have her cat

[Verse 1]
Pass me the 151 and coke cat, then later
We'll find where the dope at, but hold that, I seen
Somethin' so fat that I wish I could've drove back to
Get my kodac

Strip teaser lovin' who got the visa got it then she will
Please ya nada then she don't need ya prada Gucci for leisure
It's her duty to feed ya amnesia caribou and tequiza

Off the turn buckle baby bubba had the booty and boobies
It was a nudy so cudie was a cutie I gotta get near
Her I got a mucho deniro look at her look at herself in
The mirror moving like shakira

Made my way to the front of the stage hunits for days
The body I wanted to praise will she get with a nigga
Maybe she bent over and said thanx and I whispered
In her ear

[Chorus]
I love the way you make it slither baby, every night
When I come thru that looks like somethin' that I
Wanna run thru, you want some ooow you know I want you
Baby we can have fun too
[Repeat 2x]

[2nd Verse]
Will she ask me for a lap dance? Then Trav said
She too fine fat chance, boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap
And I slap hands with millionaires and plus I got stacks
Man

She approached me slowly, holy moly, Chef Boyardees cheese
And Beef ravioli hold me close nose be op, how much evil can
Dough provoke How much? She told me nope

Said this one was on her, I'm hoping I can get the chance
To put in on her she slithered on me put the booty on
My lap and got ta girating, was I waiting for the
Pushin' grabbing and vibrating

But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over tried to explain it the best that I could
She put her mouth on the crotch of my pants and said hddddddd

[Chorus]
[Repeat 2x]

[3rd Verse]
Said she needed 400 to tip out I whip out the grip so
Quick so we can dip out the trick house, told my homies
Not to poke their lip out I'm going to rip out the guts and
Try to throw my hip out

Now it's time to trip out got at the bitch house was 3
Fine female roommates my homies missed out, took me to
Her room and threw me right on the bed got right on the head
What a wonderful night it was said

Then along came 3, 36 double D. Sizes kissin' and lickin'
On me and they comin' to do what wake my dude up but
One of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood

Then the other and the others, instead of bud lovers
I'm trapped with blood suckin' mutha fuckas 4 eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga all
Because I said to a stripper I love the way you make it'
