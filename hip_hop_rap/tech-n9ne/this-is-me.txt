[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Hahahaha, in the world of BET
I'm just too better than rock and roll huh
In the world of MTV
My name is too gangsta huh, hahaha
Man, Stragne Music we got this baby
This year we got this one baby
Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Never been a harder rhymer in my region globaly thats holdin' me I'm totaly hard and bossed up
Why you think the majority of the rap musical authority sword me and balled and crossed 'em
Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in then
Spit his hiems speakin' a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbiddin my hisems are hidden
My mind, to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne, is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you, perminitly delayin' you, swayin' through
It's the gay in you thats hatin' who somethin' that hella beyond that does
I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough
And you can see it in my retina
That I won't be lettin' ya
Threatinas better respect Tech the messengas
Too dope on this to be
History listen this is a mystery
While they spittin' and dissin' me

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kalico]
This is me this is me
I'm a king, I'm a klown, I'm a G I'm a G
I believe what I want
Got you singin' my song
But your seein' me wrong
So what's a matter with me?
This is the belief the belief
The religion has arisin' from the deep from the deep
Darkest prison if you listen you will see you will see
If colision your decision you will reep what you so forget what you know this is me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
This is Tech bra
For years I've been the next to collect a plethra of checks lets get extra
Is what I set ta
Travis let's go select the baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in exta
See I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
come and wreck the sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deckta
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records
If you knew my musics hanibal lecta
What the hell you callin' for Masta Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweet you be on a quest to
Investagate your techma respect the
Shockra tease in hop to these
Hot degress me and Mr. O ahpotraphe
Never listen to these popasees cause they suck!
I love 50 Cent he gritty went he vent but I'm rough
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas
The grass is greana
Made it ma to the top of the world
Kiss me, miss me This Is Me
Can't you see?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The industry treat me like a ride on the short bus
Thats why I'm tellin' they youngstas when your retourt cuss
And make a fort fuss
Cause you went out on Sam Goody on F.Y.E. with they money and you support us
Strangas, Shadys, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Loseas, Shootas, College women and gutta hoes
Rock it from prescios doe
Drops it just lets it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block us stop at the record store
This is Aaron Yates thizlely in rain
This is for little Donnie this is for all ?? pain
This is, for the sickness of Marty Sue
This is for all the ?? Lou
This is for Ike and Ricky
?? Rhonda, Barbra, and Marla really
This is for B'zle and I know that rest of my family is with me
This is my friends, this is the end, this is a G
This is life, this is worng, this right, this is me

[Hook - 2X]
