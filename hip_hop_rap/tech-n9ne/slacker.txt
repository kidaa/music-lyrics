[Chorus]
Imma slacker, never did I have a lot of dough
Imma slacker, smoking pot and watchin' videos
Imma slacker, go whichever way the wind blows
Those just tuning in I'm just letting' ya know
That Imma slacker, every time I take a look around
Imma slacker, stuck upon my face is a frown
I don't do enough, I just fool around
Ya'll can go to hell, how does that sound

[Verse 1]
Imma product of reganomics neurotic they sayin'
I'm it just got up inhaling chronic
The oddest I'm staying honest
I'm bout to make it famous
So you can take that J.O.B. and
You can shove it up your anus.

I ain't never understood how the world works
But I always understood why
The girls twirk for a baller not a 9 to 5
Barely makin' it with disgust behind your eyes

So I just grip my piece, rip off fleece
Out to take yo lip off chief
With my peeps we ruthless
If you got money induce it goofs get toothless
We loose off 2 fifths we useless

I wanna kick it but ain't got the dough
Sneak in the concert trip and make'em stop the show
We gots ta go, push me and I'll sock the po
Getting' the bail my parents is impossible

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now you can tell by my everyday fits I ain't rich
I sneak with a piece when I grit
I'm just another gat man caught up in the mix
Tryin' to take your dollar and your 15 cents I grind wit a pistol

I stay rid of you lames yaw gay and play
Video games all day what Kansas City, MO brangs
Is gritty slow gain we ditty bop wit really no change yaw pay
And people holla how ya do dat there
Why your pants hangin' low and why you grew dat hair
Lightin' a bleezle with my people
Ridin' a regal always in trouble wit coppers cause we drivin' illegal

And I ain't never giving them lee way
To hem me nay the judicial assembly's
Gay hay I come out at night cause I sleep all day
Tryin' to get with Def Jam. Loud or MCA

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Get to the party and my homies gotta pay 4 me
Holidays them just be another day 4 me
Getting' drunk hoping I get to the crilla safely
Pray 4 me cause I'm needing money majorly

I sit at home watching MTV
Wit a empty P.O.C.K.E.T. I MP3
Everything that I hear on the streets
Never buy it don't deny it
I'm the fear Imma beast

You say get a job, I say hit a knob
Cause the way you run the world, is every bit of fraud
So what you ask of me? You get no tax from me
I got whites native and Mexican and blacks with me

I'm tryin' to get up there with Master P. pass the D.
Cause that's the way it has to be
We bust 2 B free, we trust who be G.
So fuck who be glee, it sucks to be me

[Chorus]
[Repeat 2x]
