[Chorus]
He won't play me on radio cause they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody wanna deal with a nigga that got it together
For real and even think his own thoughts
Everybody wanna do what everybody else doing the copy cat is what
They been taught, Imma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain and imma give it to the rap game
The way you're doing it the way you're persuing it you're
Gonna ruin it villain it's a god damn shame.

Are you ready for the real here we go now,
Most on the radio can't flow now,
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another pac or an O-Town
You can't have a contest or a show down
When two cats got the same kind of flow sound
Tecca Nina I'm coming to put the mo down
Run up in the record label with a four pound

Am I too versatile cursed to drown in the bowels
Of the earth man I'll be first to growl and burst out the vowels
Of the original murderist verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one running the race
That's real I'm speaking to everyone in the place
I can deal with you don't like the drum
And the bass if you can deal with a mother fucking gun in your face

I can't get with it, record labels and the industry is sick with it
P.D.'s some really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch if you diss my hit, you might get pistol whipped
Catch'em in the hall, hitt'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans they can get it all
Cause the industry is punks, Tech I'm ready to get krunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 2]
How many 2 pacs and JZ's and Master P's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few gloc's 380's and master keys will make'em bleed
How you gonna say black people won't listen to this or don't listen to that
Like saying a fool can slang cane a fool can gang bang but never will get hit with a
gat

You better get your story straight cause I ain't no devil for real
I'm a rebel for real that Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You're a pebble to real niggas songs like Psycho Bitch and Real Killer
Einstein nigga that's a mill stealer the idiots say black folk won't feel us

What you think we dumb? Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showing original tongue it'll be fun but the mother fuckers want the bums
And the weak ones Suge Knight punked
The industry quick that's because most the industry's bitch nigga
I'm a man I don't be running from nobody we deal with niggas who trippin' and giving
us shit

Radio won't play the unk fay thought they wanted rap
To advance but they ont day when I die imma aunt hay
Every industry faggot who giving money to an unk pay
Tech and Tekneko get people involved from KC to Mexico
Strapped with that fat desert eagle run up on the industry
And let the heat go

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 3]
You can look into my E.Y.E.'s and you can see why these
Mother fuckers don't wanna see my steeze
Cause imma killa when lyricals come undone I do miracles
And I come from the kingdom of rumble drums
And hums become bumbles, I'm the one that begun the gun tongue get sprung
Got everyone comin' in bundles

Act like a bitch treated like a bitch, act like a chump
Treated like a chump when the funk jumps what you gonna want?
Ain't gon want nothin' industry punks you can run but ya can't hide from the ride
You can say that it's dope but I won't buy it, you can think Tech 9
Really won't fly but I got a killer ear and a killer eye

Def Jam take chances in my opinion, they give advances to the niggas
That's really on universal loud laface, that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots most of 'em on some hater shit.

That other shit, for ya mother sis or your brother bitch
Not no lover lick, packing blackened fat and blubber shit
Yeah, the radio dead cause the industry is punks put the
Double barrel to its foe head

[Chorus]
[Repeat 8x]
