[Verse 1]
I'm kickin' it with this chick up in the club I'm off
The lou, and when you're on that caribou

you know just what to do,

I called her bianca

then she said what is that bianca shit
I looked and cracked a smile

and said bianca means you bitch

You's a biank baby, whether you like it or not

but you hot especially with ex & vicaden popped.

If you trippin' you can hike it and hop,

cause you know what I came to do

me and my villains come to strike it and stop

Pipe it and prop ya leg up and get up

bianca hold ya head up

your sex wet the bed up,

everybody's pondering wondering

about my slang that I spit, you can use it

when you refer to a dame or a chick

Don't be trippin' about the choice of words I'm using
On this script, don't step off in my face cause you
Can bet that I come equipped,

you wanna know what
You say, to get that biank to let you blend, what

Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn

[Chorus]
Bianca's and beatrice's

are known for wetting matrices
And bending over in the ill positions
Bianca's and beatrice's

they love the way I'm rapping this

I dig'em then I plug'em and I diss'em
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2]
You know dat'.
New brand nigga Kutt Calhoun, Who dat

Be rapping wit Tech, heard he just signed a big deal and estimated 5 or 6 million
That nigga fine if he willing Imma blow his mind, BITCH!!

Got yo whole brain dissolved
