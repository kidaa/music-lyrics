[Verse 1]
I be bussin', parents be fussin and cussin'
Cause all I talk about is silicon and muffins
So if you didn't come to hear some strip club hits
Then get the hell on cause I'm getting' my mail on I'm hustlin'

I'm talkin' about foes I'm talkin' about fans and kitties
I'm talkin' about ho's and I'm talking about Kansas City
That's where I dwell wit wit, my, my vills and I, I, I will
Pop hot rocks 4 real venomous

When it gets hot, the Tech's straight killin' hataz
When it gets rock, the sex rates 10 I made her sit on this jock
Spits quick game inovator chick generator quick trip James Lemonader

This is the beginning of blingin' and houses
And women welcoming angels and demons on couches
And sinnin' I'm alive and well
The demise will bring ghost stories when I rise
In hell them alive will still vote 4 me

[Chorus]
Watch out cause here comes Tecca nina
Roll out cause here comes Tecca nina
Drop down cause here comes Tecca nina
Here comes Tecca nina
Here comes Tecca nina

[Verse 2]
Bunsai baby everone's high smokin' and drinkin'
And poppin' so hurry come fly cause I got plenty rolls
And I got plenty dough and we got plenty ho's
We roll on 24's

What it is? What it was? And what it shall be?
Where the blizz? Where the ale? Where's the belve?
Caraboulou is 151 and Malibu Rum and pineapple so
What's this weakness you tryin' to sell me?

I represent the Rogue Dog Villain niggas
Better repent the foes all feelin triggas
You got me bent, we rolls all peelin skrilla
Roll call willin' killaz froze yall feelin' millas

This be the best time to bust your best rhyme
You bring your best rhyme I'm on your next line
And when I flex mine I see respect signs call the request line
And just say TECH N9NE

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They call me Tecca nina that be my nickname
I often wreck arenas most of 'em chicks man
Spoil us with checks and Visa cause how we spit game
Havin' her bless the weiner I love 2 get brain

4 chicks in the back of the truck, backin' it up
Suckin' on tongues, laughin' it up
Gassin at Kutt, bussin' her bun slappin' it up
Quick wrappin' it up, get thrust with no funds then passin the butt

Absolute when I shoot the shit
Juice the chicks with flows that you use ta get
Take 'em to Adam's house, don't rat 'em out
Or take 'em down to wesses get breastes
Up in yo face and scat 'em out

Make room 4 the crew with beats
That thump I got the sickness horny chicks mighty mine be
Straight doom, 4 the crew that skeet
Like chumps I bring 'em 66 triple 8 46993

[Chorus]
[Repeat 2x]
