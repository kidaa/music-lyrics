Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan

[1st Verse]

In the new millennium
You can't play with nobody's mind
Man
Deliberately messing up a good thing
Or holding up a grind
And
You already knowing life's a big fight
Against time
Man
Crime minds
Really shine
Who's dying
Is the kind
Man
When some of us
Find that life ain't beautiful
We switch to
Pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five
Ain't suitable
For the cuticles
I'm going bad
Currently I keep ending up
With even less
Than I had
Record company
Is dealing me something sad
How do you expect
A man to sit
And wait with three kids
For you to
Figure out
What Tech's SINGLE is
Going bad
I feel like
I just might
Act a fool
When I see 'em
Gotta a nigga
Feeling petty
Looking forward
To perdeium
I got some issues
Most of these record execs
Are soft as tissues
Defecate on they self
When they here some
I'm gon get yous
Understand this
When a Rogue's at
You're trying to hold back
His dough sack
And try to bozack
And he go cock
The 4 4 back
You chose that
So cut these ties
And I'll rise
Let's compromise
Or else
I'll hop a plane
With my guys
QDIII said
It ain't all good
When you sign with a record label
Who ain't
Had a hot soundtrack
Ever since
Boyz N Da Hood

[Bridge]

I'm going bad
No luck
I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
So rough
I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
No church
I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
Disperse
I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now

[Hook-Charmelle]

This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angles to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever

[LeCoya LeJuene]

No one wants to see
An angel in this world
In these days
To them I am
The epitome of evil
A found soul
Looking to save the lost
To them I am death
And of not wanting
An evil man

[2nd Verse]

For living expenses
They gave me like
Thirty-five G's
Picture me in a hospital
Shot up
With thirty I V's
That's what I really needed
When I found out
This drama
Trauma
Instead of moving
I should've kept all that
And continued to stay
With my girls Momma
Gutter
Living
Got me tripping
I'm smoking bud daily
Gutter
Living
Got me tripping
I'm going blood crazy
Gutter
Living
Got me tripping
I'm struggling like a bad actor
Gutter
Living
Got me sounding like
The Madd Rapper
The bad influence
The bad apple
The bad seed
That's me
The bad people
The bad karma
The bad breed
Mushroom tripping
Brain's a mushroom cloud
Finding groupies
Tugging on my zipper
While I'm hanging on
To my vows
Demons surround me
In triple
Stage darkness
And taunt me
They know I'm the good guy
Going bad
So they want me
All my family remembers
Way back in the day
I was good
But they doubt now
Disperse
I'm going bad
Feel me out now

[Hook-Charmelle]

This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever

[LeCoya LeJuene]
To say going bad
To most
Ha
Never been good
Just getting worst
Thoughts to destroy
And to tear things apart
Thoughts to praise
Adore
And to love
The trick is
What voice is telling you what

[3rd Verse]

Mind state of a pirate
I'm irate
Used to be cool
Till some straight fool
Lit the pilot
Will I be that
Mid-town bound
In the middle of a riot
Or at a wherehouse
Shipping platinum
Shaking hands with
Violet
No love for the bane
False foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame
Twas a journey full of pain
But Tech N9NE will remain
Hella brave
And untame
So make way
For the reign
I'm bringing Highland and Wayne
No thanks to Qwest
They on the receiving end
Of the gun
I cursed you
Everytime I climb
You're getting fired
One by one
But taking one with me
Cause she knows the true meaning
Of a modern day hippie
Who creates jewels off mushrooms
And bombs sticky
HOG STYLIN'
Mid West Side
And Newday
And King Tech & Sway
These are the people keeping me alive
To this day much love
QD said
You can't make rell
With a label who let
Tipper Gore talk shit
And made 'em take Ice T's cop killer
Off the shelves

[Bridge]

I'm going bad
No luck
I'm going
Bad
So rough
I'm going
Bad
No church
I'm going
Bad
Disperse
I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now

[Hook-Charmelle]

This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever

[LeCoya LeJuene]
Right now I can't distinguish
Which voice I'm listening to
Am I evil
Or just another lost soul
Going bad
Or just been bad
And getting worst
