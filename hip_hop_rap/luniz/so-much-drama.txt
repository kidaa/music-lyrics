but end up gettin stuck in the gut, wit a dick,

because they heard their baby-daddy fucked wit me,
but I'm out on you hoes,

Verse 3 *Yukmouth*

Cuz when I was a youngsta, money was so damn hard to find.
But dealt wit my young comrads an we was deadly on the grind.
When I wanted to bubble, fools start trippin talkin shit.
They never woulda thought I'd be, the mutha fuckin wit all of the grip.

Check this out here you jive ass turkeys man. Hoe's slobberin-obberin in 
the O. There's only one Mobb man, don't hop on the back of the Ice Cream 
truck an get yo ass booted off.

I can't stand punks on a man hunt,

many figga that I can't throw, 
but they don't know about this bole-legged skinny nigga,
mad because I'm foldin grip,
plus rollin thick,
still up on that late night loadin clips,
holdin shit,
to myself,
shotgun bullets be bad fo them health,
so save that gang-bang shit on somebody else,
where I peep thugs,
have drugs to sell you,
don't fuck wit the L-U-N-I-Z that's what they tell you,
peep the murder we wrote, 
we roll wit C-Note an Noo-Trybe to fools slide,
at my show because I make the whole fuckin O hooride
slide to get the remedy, 
M.D.,

make you wanna pump, pump on the enemy,
been havin suicidal tendecies the whole day,
alazae will have a nigga on lock down like O.J.,
slang-a-gang-of-caine
like the Cubans,

don't fuck around an get yo life ruined fool,
so take yo last look,

Rolex took,
cuz broke niggaz make the best crooks,
you best look over your shoulder, highrolla,
wit that cola, cuz my soldiers come wit mo folks then yours does,
no bluers or blunders,

an strapped wit a Mac-11 an go under.
