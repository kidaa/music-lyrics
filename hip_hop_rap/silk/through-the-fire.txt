Days of working, and years of rain
A handful of hope sometimes
Leads to tears in rain
We'll never give - no
- we'll never give in
We're addicted to that rush
City to city - from show to show
That's the only way we want to go
Even though the road is gettin' tough
Through the fire we will ride
For power and glory - side by side
Through the fire we will ride
You can beat and mistreat us
But you can't take our pride
We will ride
Well it ain't for the money
That we might never see
But these few hours on stage
Are the very best cause to be
We got an aim and that's all we need for now
We can make it anyhow
City to city - from show to show
That's the only way we want to go
Even though the road is getting tough
Through the fire we will ride
For power and glory - side by side
Through the fire we will ride
You can beat and mistreat us
But you can't take our pride
