[Intro]
Love is as love does 
And I choose you, I choose you 

Wind in your hair, sun on your skin 
You're looking good girl, all over again 
Hey there, Miss Brown 
I want you to know, I love you 

Brown as the sand, as soft as the shore 
You're leaving me hungry and crying for more 
Ooh-wee, baby, girl, you're such a score 
And I want you to know that 
You know, girl 

1 - 	I love you 
	Bet you didn't know that, girl 
	You didn't know that 
	I need you right now baby, right now baby 
	And I bet you didn't know that 
	Ebony eyes 

Lips soft and tender, ready to speak 
I heard a voice say I love you 
And it's making me weak 
Hey there, little girl, may I just say to ya 
I love you, I love you, I la la love you 

Love is the brown skined girl in my eyes 
Think it's time that I told you that 
Told you, told you 
Don't you realize you're such a queen 
Woman, you're such a prize 
And I want you to know that 
You know what, girl 

Repeat 1 

Oooh 
Pretty, beautiful brown-eyed queen of mine 
Queen of mine 
Girl I love you ebony eyes 
I bet you didn't know, oh

Bet you didn't know that 
You didn't know that 
Hey Girl

And I bet you didn't know that 
Ebony eyes

And I bet you didn't know that 
Ebony eyes
