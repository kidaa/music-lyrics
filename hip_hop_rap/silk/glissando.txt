I believe someone's blood is another one's wine
i believe someone's trace is another one's sign
i believe someone's live is another one's hate
i believe someone's soon is much too late
you look surprised - you shouldn't be, my friend
this world is full of cretins who still pretend
to sell tomorrow and a guiding light
i do believe in nothing but the night
someone's pleasure is another one's pain - glissando
someone's fire is another one's rain - glissando
someone's lightning flashed in vain - glissando
i believe - i don't know
i believe - life will show
i believe - it's time to go
glissando

i believe someone's lie is another one's truth
i believe someone's dawn is another one's youth
i believe someone's gold is another one's grey
i believe someone's lust is the price to pay
you look surprised - you shouldn't be, my friend
this world is full of cretins who still pretend
to sell tomorrow and a guiding light
i do believe in nothing but the night
someone's pleasure is another one's pain - glissando
someone's fire is another one's rain - glissando
someone's lightning flashed in vain - glissando
i believe - i don't know
i believe - life will show
i believe - it's time to go
glissando
someone's pleasure is another one's pain - glissando.....
