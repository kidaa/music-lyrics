[Intro] 
So tell me baby 
Whatchu wanna do? 
We got all night 

So baby it's on, it's on, it's on, yeah 
Deeper, deeper baby 
Deeper than he's ever gone 
Cuz I can go on and on and on 

You've got to show me lady 
Just how you feel 
I want to relax your mind 
And go so deep 
Because I can go deeper baby 
Deeper than he's ever gone 
Cuz I need it, and you want it 
Cuz you've got what I want and I want what's inside 

1 - 	Can we do it on the low 
	Keep the lights down 
	I can do a sex move and get funkey 
	Workin' it like it ain't no thing 
	Makin' it sweet in the sheets 
	From your head down to your feet 

2 - 	Deeper, deeper baby 
	Deeper than he's ever gone 
	So baby it's on, it's on, it's on 
	I can go deeper, deeper baby 
	Deeper than he's ever gone 
	Cuz I can go on, and on, and on 

Champagne and candlelights would be nice 
Just me and you 
Let's start things off right tonight 
Girl, what should we do babe 
Let's sit and fantasize about me and you 
We're takin' it up and down and round and round 
Givin' you everything that you need 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 2 

Deeper baby, deeper baby 
Deeper than he's ever gone 
Deeper baby, deeper baby 
Deeper than he's ever gone 

I can go deep if you let me 
I can go deep if you want me 
I can go deep when you want me to 
I can go deep 

I can go deep if you let me 
I can go deep if you want me 
I can go deep when you want me to 
I can go deep 

Repeat 2 until fade
