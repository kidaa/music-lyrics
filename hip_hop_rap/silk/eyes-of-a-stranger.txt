They sell you sixty-nine and a thousand tales
Just to make your fortune
In this kingdom made of glitter and tears
Honesty on the run
Afraid to touch the taken sun
And the lost light a candle
But don't forget you can touch the sky
Just follow your heart
You can't get out - with eyes of a stranger
Can't get out - you'll never stand on lies
So scream and shout
With eyes of a stranger you'll always be blind
Silent scream in the night
Parasites try to hide
Behind success, glam and glory
Passion dies - all these lies
Oppression - fashion - blinded eyes
And the raped tell the story
But don't forget you can touch the sky
Just follow your heart
You can't get out - with eyes of a stranger
Can't get out - you'll never stand on lies
So scream and shout
With eyes of a stranger you'll always be blind
