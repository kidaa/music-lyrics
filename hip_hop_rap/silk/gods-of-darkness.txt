The silent gods of darkness
Let owls rain down on me
Red roses from tomorrow
Renew my last dawn's key
Like the drifter needs the road
And the poet needs the pain
Like the thief needs everything
and the flower needs the rain
All I need is a deep black sky
And the silence of the night
I use to sleep all day
Just to hide from the rays of light
But now suddenly
Everything has changed
Confusion rules my mind
My whole life's been dearranged

Just to see you once again
I'd walk the endless mile
Sittin' here while the sun shines bright
And the colours of your smile
Let the fogs burn in jealousy
Am I wrong or am I right?
After stayin' up all day
I really slept last night !!!
Your kisses taste like blood
And your skin's deadly cold
Behind your dark sunglasses
Your face looks young but old
And now you start to cry and say:
For you I can stand the light
For a while but not for longer
'Cause I'm a creature of the night
The silent gods of darkness.........
