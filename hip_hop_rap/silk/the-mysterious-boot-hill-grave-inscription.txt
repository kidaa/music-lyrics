mother said: don't believe in dreams
she said: life's too hard to swing against the streams
then she gave you a kiss and turned out the light
but you couldn't sleep at all
and you made your decision
to hold on tight -
to keep your heart
wide open - just to play your part and fight
and never take this small forever
- some give all
the mysterious boot hill grave inscription
We don't need no one
one for the dreamer in a world made of stone
two for the stranger who's left without hope and alone
call me a drifter with a faith bound to die
will you still betray - cover each day with a lie?
and time - time will tell
time will show you a reason why
too late to try
just fate - goodbye
the mysterious boot hill grave inscription
We don't need no one
- Some give all when all give some
and when the world's just a comedy
some will leave and some will fall
cause when I do give something
- some give all
do you remember the fears and the lights
do you believe in the silence and dark sleepless nights
once a companion - always a fool
over, done, finished and out and again just the rule
and time - time will tell
time will show you a reason why
too late to try
just fate - goodbye
the mysterious boot hill grave inscription
We don't need no one
- some give all when all give some
and when the world's just a comedy
some will leave and some will fall
cause when I do give something
- some give all
......and everybody calls your name
