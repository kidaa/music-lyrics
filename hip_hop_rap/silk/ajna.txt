The rain is falling down 
Can you hear the silence? 
Can you hear my voice? 
Pale in the autumn mist 
Ajna 

Where are you now? 
I'm waiting here on planet earth 
Ajna 
Where are you now? 
I'm waiting here on mother earth 

I'm runnung up the hill 
I look to the stars 
I can see for miles and miles 
But you're out of sight 
Ajna 

Where are you now? 
I'm waiting here on planet earth 
Ajna 
Where are you now? 
I'm waiting here on mother earth 
Ajna 

I'm lost in this world 
No way to the universe 
In my ivory-tower 
I wait for your rise 
The rise from the dead 
It's her resurrection-day
