Mondy we cry when leaves are fallin'
tuesday a ray of hope is callin'
wednesday we spend the night together
thursday we try to love forever
friday we're left -again- alone
and the weekend's dressed in black and made of stone
stay gold - when the world comes down on you
stay gold - when you're lost in days of blue
stay gold - when forever's lies come true - so
stay gold - when you haven't got a clue
stay gold
of war and reason
- trigger and season - just to get closer
lies again - over when we are
just like the angry ones torn apart
we ride in vain
down the rain
old at heart
stay gold.....
yesterday life was fast and yellow
today we believe in answers mellow
tomorrow we lose our common senses
eternity comes with picket fences
stay gold.....
