standin' in the rain
sometimes love is pain - yes it is
take me back - back to light
back to where we hold on tight - death
Romeo and Juliet
no surrender, no regret
you and me - you and I
trust is fear until we lie
inside we die
inside - taken by
Lust is a killer - lust is a test
Lust is a killer, - comin' back
Lust is a killer - lust is a test
Lust is a killer on the attack
no excess for me
'round the pleasure sea
every kiss could be the last
to soon - too fast - at all
always on my mind
gettin' to nowhere ridin' the wings of time
inside we die...
se evil's calling
so lust is a test
so evil's fast coming back
so evil's falling down
enjoy the rest...
