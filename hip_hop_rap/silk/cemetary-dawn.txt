Nameless cross on the misty rain
Reminds on hopes gone down the drain
You - who's burried at this lonely place
Were proud to be a man as you lost the race
Or did you cry in vain
Did you scream for your mother but she never came
Dead soldier - what was your age
As you died - were you still a child in the cage
You were food for the guns
Missing in action like a billion sons
With no chance to get old
If you'd been a coward - you're a hero in my eyes
If you've been a cold killer who believed their lies
I'll pray for your soul
And so I bow my head
As I sit at your grave and remember the dead
Who died for another one's pride
Cemetary dawn - traces in the darkness
Cemetary dawn - shadows of the past
Cemetary dawn - faces of the pain will last
All them faceless gods of war
What the hell are they fighting for
Losers & winners - all the same
Victims of that vicious game
Or did you cry in vain
Did you scream for your mother but she never came
Dead soldiers - what was your age
As you died
Cemetary dawn - traces in the darkness
Cemetary dawn - shadows of the past
Cemetary dawn - faces of the pain will last
