one Cain of a friend
pain in the end - that's the roll of the dice
eyes filled with tears
when brain disappears - that's the roll of the dice
well, life's a gamble just
and traps are callin' us
we live from day to day without a care
we may forget sometimes as leaves are fallin'
the crets are howling 'cause they're out to get their share
so it's one for insanity - two for the size
no for an answer - the roll of the dice
...and the winds scream in anger
and the faces of time turn to lies
the winds scream in anger
it's the roll of the dice
it's more than a kiss
what we call the abyss - that's the roll of the dice
so lay down your card
it may break you apart - that's the roll of the dice
...and the winds scream in anger
and the faces of time turn to lies
the winds scream in anger
it's the roll of the dice
