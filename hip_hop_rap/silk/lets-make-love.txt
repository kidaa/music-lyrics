Every time I think about 
All the little freaky things you do 
Make me wanna touch you girl 
You make me wanna rush all into you 

Even though I'm hanging out 
Just page me girl 
That's all you gotta do 
Never had a love so good and baby 
I'm glad that you're my boo 

Let's make love 
Whoa, like the very very very first time 
I wanna make love 
Can I feel you up from behind, yeah 
Can we make love 
Baby, I wanna hear you tell me that it's all mine mine mine mine 
Can we, can we make love 
Can we make love 
Can we, can we make love 
Can we make love 

Feels so good to be inside 
I'm glad you let me in between your thighs 
Let me lick you up and down 
Please your body til' you scream out loud 
Toss your body back and forth 
Turn around 
So I can watch you ride, yeah 
I like the way you make me sweat 
Oh baby, your love has got me high 

Let's make love 
Yeah, oh baby, like the very first time 
I wanna make love 
Oh yeah, baby can I feel you up from behind, yeah 
Can we make love 
Oh, baby tell me that it's all mine, babe 
Can we, can we make love 
Oh tell me babe it's all mine, all mine 
Can we, can we make love 
Can we make love 

Well it's been awhile 
Since I've had someone 
Turn me on from head to toe, baby 
Girl, you're all I want 
You're all I need 
Girl, you're all I need 
So let's make love 
Make love, make love 
Cuz babe, make me so horney 
Ain't loved you in a long time
