I can feel a desert wind
Hear it howlin' in the streets tonight
It's a warning noone fears
And there ain't no place where we can hide
Strangers lost in silence
Empty hearts and blinded eyes
Dangers taste like violence
Tears - while conversation dies
Lack of communication leads to
Asphalt - deserts - streets of pain
Darkness calls the light
When all the water's banned
And cares are buried under sand
The wind will turn into a wasteland serenader
So wake up - just stop feeding dust
Open your minds and learn to trust
It's never too late - never too late to try
Cages of confusion
In this world of broken dreams
Social constitution
Tries to hide behind the streams
Lack of communication leads to
Asphalt - deserts - streets of pain
Darkness calls the light
When all the water's banned
And cares are buried under sand
The wind will turn into a wasteland serenader
So wake up - just stop feeding dust
Open your minds and learn to trust
It's never too late - never too late to try
I can feel a desert wind
Hear it howlin' in the streets tonight
