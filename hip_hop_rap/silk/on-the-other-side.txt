Do you remember slow-motion-times
With little golden stars?
I see you tumble in the streets
I hold your hand in the cinema
A piece of haven
In a rotten world
You dissapeared in a roaring night
I could die
I CRY

On the other sideI'll see you again
On the other side
We'll walk hand in hand
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
We'll walk hand in hand
I saw you again with tears in your eyes
My heart beats hard
Time doesn't move in a picture
But I can't live in the past
Life is easy
If you don't care about the future
And it's easy to smile
If you din't care about the truth
I still love you
But I've changed myself
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
We'll walk hand in hand
On the other side
I'll see you again
On the other side
We'll walk hand in hand
When I see you ...
