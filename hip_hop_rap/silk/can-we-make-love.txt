Everytime I think about all the little freaky things you do 
Makes me wanna touch you girl makes me wanna brush up into your 
Even thoughj I'm faithful now, Faithful now,I'm knocking at your door 
Never had a love so good and baby I'm glad that you're my boo 

Chorus 
Let's make love 
like the very very very first time 
I wanna make love 
can I feel you up from behind 
Let's make love 
I wanna hear you tell me that it's all mine,mine mine

Feels so good with me inside 
I'm glad you let me in between your thighs 
let me lick you up and down and please your body till you scream out loud 
Toss your body back and forth so I can watch your eyes yeah 
I like the way you make me sweat oh baby your love has got me high

Well it's been awhile since I had someone to turn me on from head to toe

cause baby me so horny me love you a long time 

Chorus 

can we, can we make love 6x's
