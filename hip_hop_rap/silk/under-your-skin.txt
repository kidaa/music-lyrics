You're under my skin, 
your loce in my venes 
there's blood on the floor my love 
I touch your lips, 
I know we can find the end of the Rainbow 

And when I die - and when I die 
nothing can tear us apart 
and when I die - and when I die 
I'll never leave you 

Your shadow in my mind - 
your heart in my heart 
I've never Touched you, girl 
wherever you are, 
whatever you do I'll never let you go 

Don't turn around 
don't turn around girl 
in the night in the dark 
there's no return 
fly with me in a blue blue sky 
fly with me across the sea, my love 

I'm under your skin - 
nothing can tear us apart 
I'm under your skin - 
always inside you my love 
I'm under your skin
