one stormy night an angel fell
the raven sold his dreams in hell
to keep the light from burning skies
like he's been told to roll the dice
the angel smiled and said hello
I'm just a tale from long ago
the endless mile I've walked alone
l've roamed the trail of tears and stone
fogs rise - when dreams decay
fools - wise - who dares to say
it's over now - it's over now - someway - somehow
the wheel stopped turning
it's over now - it's over now - it's over now
and real
the raven laughed and then he cried
of war and blood and those who died
...one friend to have is worth the weight
and what you've got - you'll see too late...
