most of the time
I tried to win
in a world that's much too cold to see
but still I believe
there's a river to cross
and beyond the waters someone waits for me
and all the years I can't deny
and all the tears you'll never cry for me
but I will never loose again
saw all the things I had to see
and I will never loose again
all the pain - all the pride
all the rain and all the light
most of the time
I tried to live
like an eagle on his wings up in the skies
and I made some mistakes
but still no regrets
and all the reasons are like mountains in my eyes
and so I take my clothes again
hit the road - it's over when I'm gone
on and on
and I will never loose again
saw all the things I had to see
and I will never loose again
all the pain - all the pride
all the rain and all the light
