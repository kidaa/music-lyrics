Once water took the fire
And landscapes ate the seas
Then preachers grew and hatred too
The birth of a disease
I'm afraid of new crusaders
Who force our freedom's fall
Religions still course so much pain
And backs against the wall
Are we just too blind to see
Will we never learn how great
This life could be
Why do we praise the fight
Tell me why
Can't we take the night away
Why must children cry
Can't we make this world a better place
Without hatred day by day
Why can't we finally find a way
We need no heroes
To protect us from our fears
Just by filling children's eyes with tears
Innocent victims of fanatics gone insane
This power will last forever they said
And millions died in vain
Are we just too blind to see
Why do we praise the fight
Tell me why
Can't we take the night away
Why must children cry
Can't we make this world a better place
Without hatred day by day
Why can't we finally find a way
