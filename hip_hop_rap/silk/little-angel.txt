Under the Linden, down in the park 
There is a small light in the dark 
Under a pale moon, down by the lake 
There is a way to a secret place 

Leaning on your shoulder the world is clear and bright 
At the end of the night 
On your shoulder everything's all right 
On your shoulder 

Little angel dressed in white - The universe in your eyes 
Can you hear my voice? 
Can you help me through the night? I am scared like a child 
I've lost my innocence 

Leaning on your shoulder the world is clear and bright 
At the end of the night 
On your shoulder everything's all right 
On your shoulder 

Little angel dressed in white - and kaleidoscope-eyes 
And a virgin-smile 
There's a poison in my venes do you love me in vain? 
Why don't you touch me now? 

Leaning on your shoulder the world is clear and bright 
At the end of the night 
On your shoulder everything's all right 
On your shoulder
