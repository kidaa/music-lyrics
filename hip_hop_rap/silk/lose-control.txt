talking 
I'm sorry I never meant to hurt you 
I really didn't 
I'm so sorry 
I just want you to sit down for just a minute 
Let me talk to you 

Last night we had an argument 
You told me you love me 
All the things I said I never meant 
No baby 
I didn't mean to make you cry 
I didn't mean to make you say bye bye bye 
Baby won't you let me look inside your soul 
Let me make you lose control 
Let me be the one you need 
Baby just come to me 

Now tell me girl what you want from me 
Whatever it is you desire 
I wanna give my baby 
I wanna feel your body yearn 
All your softest spots I plan to learn 
Baby won't you let me just kiss you down 
Make you spin around and 'round 
Flip you girl from left to right 
If you don't mind 
Baby can I just spend the night 

talking 
You know what I'm talking about baby 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never wanted to see you cry 
So I'm right here now baby 
I'm asking you, I'm begging you 
Just give me one more chance baby 

Baby won't you let me just kiss you down 
Make you spin around and 'round 
Flip you girl from left to right 
If you don't mind 
Baby can I just spend the night 
Let me turn you on 

Can I turn you on 
Can I turn you on 
Till the break of dawn baby 
repeat 

ad lib till end
