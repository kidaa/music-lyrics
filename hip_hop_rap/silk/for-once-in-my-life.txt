for once in my life
for once in my life
I feel like a reason would lately arrive
with a name to recall
for once in the night
for once in the night
I feel like some fortune was with me to light
one new flame - after all
rains to the ground - rains to the world of tomorrow
saints to be found
yesterday - come what may still
one more day
- say you will -
another try - you and I
ain't gonna cry no more - cry no more - ain't gonna cry no more
for once in my life
for once in my life
trust is a blade now that cuts like a knife
and a dream to come true
for once in my tears
for once in my tears
there's destiny callin' and pain disappears
and the skies burn so blue
rains to the ground - rains to the world of tomorrow
saints to be found
yesterday - come what may still
one more day
- say you will -
another try - you and I
ain't gonna cry no more - cry no more - ain't gonna cry no more
little boy standin' by the window
tell the world what you're gonna be
little boy on the edge of silence
open eyes for new aims to see
come a day you may touch a rainbow
come a day you may fade away
come a word you may say in anger
come a price you may have to pay......
