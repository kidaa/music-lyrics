Just one look at your body 
And my heart begins to bounce 
You're looking good in everything you wear 
I like having you around 
And your lips, and your smile 
Girl you know that you're driving me wild 
I like the sexy way you wear your hair 
Wanna take you everywhere 
Cuz you know your loving's so

When I gaze into your pretty eyes 
Girl you know you got me hypnotized 
And when I get my hands on you 
Lemme tell you what I'm gonna do 
Gonna give you loving 
That makes your body tingle through and through 
Cuz your lips, oh your smile 
Girl you know that you're driving me wild 
I like the sexy way you wear your hair 
Wanna take you everywhere 

Repeat 1 

I never ever had to dream about nobody else 
Cuz you're my every thing I want you all to myself 
You know I gotta thank the Lord above 
For sending me you 
Baby you make me whole 
And without your love I'm through
