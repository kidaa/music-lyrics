will the forces of daybreak someday quit the fight?
do androids dream of electric sheep in the night?
faster than light?
will princes of anger on horses of pain
gather in silence and black where only skeletons
remain
in the toxical rain?
and we dance to the beat of the night
- swallow our fears for the trace of a moment
while chances retreat in the light
follow acid tears down to the river of
toxical roses - toxical roses
where do we go - straight to the overkill?
chemical weapons - greenhouse effect
industrial dragons in search of a cause
Tschernobyl - Avalon - spaces' jaws?
the old entertainer - once jester of kings
but nobody listens when now of puppets
he sings - on toxical strings
and we dance to the beat of the night
- swallow our fears for the trace of a moment
while chances retreat in the light
follow acid tears down to the river of
will someday time stand still
or can we find a way
to catch a lightning in the dark
to open the eyes of the world?
