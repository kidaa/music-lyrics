Things are lookin' better now 
We're still in this game somehow 
And we owe it all to you 
Lord, you never let us down 

It's time for us to close the show 
We wanna let our people know, oh yeah 
You might not always see a face 
But our music stays around, around 

We always keep our music real 
We cater to that sex appeal 
Give you something you can feel 
Hope you enjoyed the smooth silky sounds 

We hope we made you loose control 
Hope we took you to the next level 
It's time to say goodbye for now 
Cuz this love session is closed, is closed 

But we will return 
We're gonna come back to you, yeah 
We gotta come back to you, you yeah 
But we, we will return 
We're gonna come back to you, back to you
