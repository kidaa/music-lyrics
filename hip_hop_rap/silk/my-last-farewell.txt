So here's to you - my last farewell:
i hate your face
i hate your smile
i hate your grace
i hate your style
i hate your words
your silence, too
- all i can say is: i hate you
i hate your good
i hate your bad
i hate your blue
i hate your red
i hate your clothes
your presence, too
- all i can say is: i hate you
there's a trace and a tear below
my wishes taste like fire
you're just a gun for hire
so here's to you - my last farewell
i hope your soul will burn in hell
i've worked real hard to break this spell
all that remains is my last farewell
i hate your wrong
i hate your right
i hate your strong
i hate your light
i hate your soft
your violence, too
- all i can say is: i hate you
there's a trace and a tear below
my wishes taste like fire
you're just a gun for hire
so here's to you - my last farewell
i hope your soul will burn in hell
i've worked real hard to break this spell
all that remains is my last farewell
i hate your truth - i hate your lies
i hate your false self sacrifies
i hate your tricks - your matches, too
all i can say is: i hate you
so here's to you - my last farewell
i hope your soul will burn in hell
i've worked real hard to break this spell
all that remains is my last farewell
so here's to you - my last farewell.....
