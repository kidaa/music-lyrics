[Intro]
Mmm, Silk's in the house 
When you get good love 
You get foreplay 
When you get great love 
You get afterplay 
Welcome to afterplay 

1 - 	This is just an extra music afterplay 
	To bless that body 
	Just to make you feel good 
	Like you 'spose to 

Repeat 1 

Hey ladies, say ladies, let us in 
Or we'll huff and we'll puff and commit a sin 
When we're done and the love session ends 
We'll think of something else 
That's all I'm sayin' 
So don't be flexin', don't be flakes 

[Females]
So ya'll gon' be treating us like ladies? 

That's no question, that's no question 
And in your eyes the passion lies beneath 
But it's ok, I got you girl 
Ladies

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 

It's the way you brought the chorus 
It's the way you hold my verse 
It's the way you shout it, damn, that's tight 
As your body quench my thirst 

Musically, it was ecstasy 
It felt so good 
The lyrics melted in your mouth 
But your body understood 

We sang lullabies and made you cry 
We tried to touch you deep inside 
It's afterplay, an afterlude 
To get you back into the mood 

So let's do this thing, one more care 
Rewind the track cuz Silk is here 
Don't rush, take it slow 
Here you come, here we go 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1 

It's suppose to taste good and feel good 
And smell good and sound good 
Is it good, yeah 

Just a little something extra for ya body 
Make you feel good, make you feel good 
It's suppose to taste good and feel good 
And smell good and sound good 

This is just an extra music afterplay 
To bless that body 
It's suppose to taste good and feel good 
And smell good and sound good 

This is just an extra music afterplay 
To bless that body 
It's suppose to taste good and feel good 
And smell good and sound good
