Like the princess of time
Damned not to die
I know we all need it
A shoulder to cry on at night
A place we can hide
Blessed are the innocent
'Cause they do not know
You only can miss
What once ruled the show
In your life
Then it cuts like a knife
When memories arrive
You should not look back
And be strong to survive
To give your
Calls to the world
Open your eyes - catch the grace of an angel
Calls to the world
When you're lost in the darkness
Left standing in the rain
Alone without pleasure
Fighting the pain of tomorrow
And dance with your sorrow
You gotta hold on to your
Dreams and believe
In the power of heartblood
Don't let the thief
Of the light
Escape in the night
Don't quit the fight
Follow your conscience,
Your soul and your pride
Give your
Calls to the world
Open your eyes - catch the grace of an angel
Calls to the world
