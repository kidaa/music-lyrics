Destruction - pollution - intolerance - hatred and blood
The respect of nature's been slayed
And lies dyin' in the mud
We gods are left mightless now
As they praise their own shines
We only can send our signs
When thunder roars - in the night
Their holy wars - should be fought just to save
This world from the grave of light
Genetic creations - atomic sensations - they fly
To stars and horizons and reach for the sky
We watch them from nowhere
When they finally must pay fot their crime
We'll burry our tears in time
When thunder roars - in the night
Their holy wars - should be fought just to save
This world from the grave of light
We - are standing together
And we - are one hand in hand
And we can't believe
This race we created
Has got on the lose - begun to refuse
To try to understand
Now
Thunder roars - in the night
Change your course - you can't win the fight
Thunder roars - in the night
Their holy wars - should be fought just to save
This world from the grave of light
