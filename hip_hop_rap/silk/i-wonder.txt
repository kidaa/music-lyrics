Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya 
Ooh, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya 
Ooh, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya 
Ooh, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya 
Ooh 

Sneaking me in and out 
Everyday, any place 
Giving it all, oh oh 
Sometimes we're even bold enough 
To do it in your own home, yeah 

Now what the hell am I thinkin' 'bout 
I know damn well what goes around 
Comes around then I turn around 
We're on the ground 
Tell me what am I suppose to do 
When you start 

1 - 	I wonder if he knows and suspects that I 
	I've got you on me 
	I wonder if he knows that 
	We get a little freaky 

	I wonder if he knows that you spent last night 
	Stroakin' me right here 
	Oh so careful we must be 

I know I tried to let you go 
But my mind keeps tellin' me no no no 
But I don't wanna let you go 
Even though you're not mine 
But some of the time, and that's yeah 
And baby that's enough for me 
I know 

Repeat 1 

Hey ya, hey ya hey ya 
Ooh, hey ya 
OOh, hey ya 
Ooh, hey ya 

See wonder does he know baby 
What am I spose to do 
When he comes around 
And asks about you 
Innocently push a little shit 

Repeat 1 

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder 
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya 
Ooh hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
