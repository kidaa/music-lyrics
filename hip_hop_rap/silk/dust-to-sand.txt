I've lost and loved
sreamed and cried
i've seen the devil's face
and on the other side
i've seen the rainbow
i've seen your smile
i've seen the mountains high
and i've tried to keep my style
someday we'll find - someday we'll know
someday the blind will see to show
someday we'll fight someday we'll pray
someday
all the dreams - all the tears
all my lies and all my fears
all the blood - all the pain
all the friends i've lost in vain
all the love - all the hate
all the trust and all the fate
and when someday i'll reach the end
lust to ashes - dust to sand
i've seen the rise
i've seen the fall
i've seen 'em up again
and higher after all
i've been the trigger
i've been a fool
i've been the last to know
and i've been a tool
someday we'll find - someday we'll know
someday the blind will see to show
someday we'll fight someday we'll pray
someday
all the dreams - all the tears
all my lies and all my fears
all the blood - all the pain
all the friends i've lost in vain
all the love - all the hate
all the trust and all the fate
and when someday i'll reach the end
lust to ashes - dust to sand
lust to ashes - dust to sand.....
