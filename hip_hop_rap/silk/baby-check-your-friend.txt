[Intro]
2,000  watts 
Presents Silk 
Check it 
Check your friend 
Layin' it down with my man Steve 
Lay it down, lay it down 

And I don't know what's going on 
She's paging me, she's calling me 
I just called to see what's wrong 
She's telling me she's feeling me 
And she said I really, really turn her on 
And she can't wait to get me all alone 
Baby when you're not home, yeah, yeah 

1 - 	I can't believe the things she said to me 
	Telling me she's feeling very free-eaky 
	And I don't understand 
	When she knows that I'm her girlfriend's man 

2 - 	Baby check your friend 
	She's trying to steal your man 
	She said she'd rather have me all to herself 
	Baby check your friend 
	She's out to steal your man 
	But I could never do my baby like that 

Repeat 2 

Oh, listen now 
She saying we were meant to be 
She's trying to get to ruin me 
And why is she trying to player hate my baby 
Well I won't give a piece of me 
She had the nerve to tell me 
That she had to get with me 
She don't give a damn about you, no 
I guess she really doesn't know me 
Now I'm blowing up her spot 
And this game is getting hotter 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 2 
Repeat 2 

You share with her everything between you and I 
Oh yeah, oh 
Never shoulda told her how I do you at night 
Yeah, oh 
You can't imagine all the things she offered me 
Her plan was so secure 
Get into her bedroom door 
And baby I can't take it no more 

Repeat 2 with ad libs until fade
