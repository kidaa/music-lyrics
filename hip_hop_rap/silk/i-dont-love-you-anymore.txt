Waiting on the telephone
I can't leave the room
Maybe you'll call me
When I'm through the door
All these hopeless hours
Staring at the wall
I can't move my body
I can't speak

The sky is dark and noisy
Voices in my head
They tell me that I'm
Free again
No more chains
Free again

Hey, hey, hey
I don't love you anymore
Hey, hey, hey
I don't love you anymore

I look into the mirror
A stranger's watching me
Trembling lips
A cold shining in his eyes
The cage of my broken body
Only one way to escape
A screaming nightmare
I dream in red

The sky is dark and noisy
Voices in my head
They tell me that I'm
Free again
No more chains
Free again

Hey, hey, hey
I don't love you anymore
Hey, hey, hey
I don't love you anymore

I see your face in the crowd
Now it's time to sleep
I see fear and loathing
In your eyes
Why don't you touch me, baby?
This is the end
Come and feel the
Cold knife in my hand

The sky is dark and noisy
Voices in my head
They tell me that I'm
Free again
No more chains
Free again
