From the cradle to the grave
from the ego to the ghost
from the master to the slave
the bigger - the better - the most
so all you secret heroes
there's a reason for cries:
from lonely 1's to 0's
it's just a matter of size
from the short guy with a dog
from the river to the sea
from his thinkin' with the cock
to a braindeath - remedy
so all you secret heroes....
it's just a matter of size
