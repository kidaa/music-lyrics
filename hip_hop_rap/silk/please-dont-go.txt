Please don't go 
Away from me 
Never leave 
Oh no 

Please don't go 
Say you'll love me so 
So I will know 
Baby, please don't go 

If I could just explain 
The death of all my name 
My tears would fall like rain, oh 

But you don't understand 
Don't believe it hurts a man 
Oh no, oh no 

1 - 	Please don't go 
	Don't take your love from  me 
	Just say you'll never leave 
	Just promise and believe 

	Please don't go 
	Just say you'll love me so 
	So love me then I'll know 
	That you will never go 
	Baby please don't go 

If I could keep you near 
You would love me with out fear 
And live a thousand years 
Yes we would 
But you said you want to go 
And why, I do not know 
Oh no, oh no 

Repeat 1 

No no no no no no 
Don't go baby 
No no no no no no 
Please 
No no no no no no 
Please don't go 

Say you love me baby 
Say you'll stay 
Don't go 

Repeat 1 with ad libs until fade
