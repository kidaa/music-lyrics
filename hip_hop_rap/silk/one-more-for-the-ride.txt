thought you'd be my friend
stuck with me until the end
thought you'd be okay
thought you'd share my way
thought I could trust in you
but you broke my heart in two
thought a dream would last
but your lies came fast
oh, you act so cool
but I ain't your fool
so make it one for my pride
and one for the ride
