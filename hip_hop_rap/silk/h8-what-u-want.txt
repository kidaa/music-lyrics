maybe I'm a sinner - maybe I'm a fool
maybe I'm a prisoner of the everlasting rule
maybe I'm a looser - maybe I need a priest
maybe I've seen too much and the coming of the beast
some call me a traitor - some call me a saint
some call me a coward and what I'm shure I ain't
and I'll never go back to silence
and I'll never go back to war
and I'll never know what the reason is
and what to be fighting for
and I'll never be a warrior
and I'll never be like you
and I'll never kill tomorrow's life
whatever you may do
I'm always gonna hate what you want
remain in silence - purple heart
watching the night fall - waiting for the start
give words of desire to my song
words of fire for my soul to carry on
So take me away from here
destruction, blood and fear
and I'll never go back to silence
and I'll never go back to war
and I'll never know what the reason is
and what to be fighting for
I'm always gonna
h8 what you want
