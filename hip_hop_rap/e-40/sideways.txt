But the bitch ain't got no gas fetti gas fetti
So I burnt her like Fast Freddy Fast Freddy
Hit me on the first when your mail has come
And maybe we can go to the mall or somethin to the mall or somethin

Heavy ass shit for the mob -- for the mob
When I make a zillion I resign -- I resign
I'm realer than a hundred dollar bill with the line across
When Christmas come around ask Santa Claus
Santa do you know E-40
Bet you that nigga say  quot;That's my homey! quot;
We used to perv grind curb trip to my grandma

Hoes just wanna be pacified
But I can't do no justice cuz the justice ain't to be did
BEOTCH!  You usin too much red

Now I've been known to break niggaz off off
Hard type or soft, line em up chalk em up as a loss
See me in the parking lot doing my thang yeah
Love to see my old school dance in the rain kick it
The po-po's came then they closed up shop kick it
Smashed through the Hood and we made that hot yah
See the shit don't stop stop motherfuckers pop pop

Riding through the shit like Racer X
And if a motherfucker flex break back and necks back and necks
Running red lights and the right-of-ways
