Intro: Raekwon, Ghostface

Yo what what, yo
Exotic type shit
Ninety-four, we must go to war fast
With the pen and the pad
God damn, shine like gold rims on Pathfinders
Wu-Tang reclines, lamps, for the nine-squares kid
  Money clothes designer hoes and shows y'all

Lyrics: Raekwon, Ghostface

Yo, yo, wakin up about ten kid
Jumpin in the shower, peace about to make 
  moves and slide like greese 
What?  I'm all about Tecs and checks and nuff respect you front
I'm slammin you like the Lex
So now I'm out in the ninety-five
Rockin that real nigga don't die 
Guess down
  Drawers Kani!
But yo I'm makin a pit stop
Go and buy a box of glocks, til he rolled up and yo
  Whattup Hobbes?
  Yo, remember that kid that we vicked
  He made a half of mil for real
  He brought about fo' bricks
Yo, so now we connect doors, meet me at the airport 
TELL GOLDEN ARMS MAINTAIN THE FORT
  Get in touch with that West coast Cali crab you stabbed
  And meet me at the bitch lab
So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit
  Couldn't even rest, I need the vic
And when I slept, I dream G's, Son I need some
  Keys roll self, call up Son
I heard Pook and Tyriq caught a beef over some real shit
  A fake nigga faked and they killed his click
Gimme a minute and I'm with it
  Yo niggaz done did it
Rock your vest
  Keep your whip tinted
  So now we see him up in BoJangles
  Stranglin a forty ounce, with ten G's worth of gold bangles
Diamonds, what, all up in his face
  With his man's mace, medallions the size of dinner plates
Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him
Took thirty G's worth of jewels of that nigga
DO HIM!
  So now I'm lampin in my man's Land
Streets is hot like sand
  Jesus rollin in my right hand
Yup, you know the steezo black
Got to go down like that
  Shallah
Cigars
AND BALL HATS
