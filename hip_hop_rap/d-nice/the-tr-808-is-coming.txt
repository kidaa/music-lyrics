Harry:  And the excitement continues to build!  Eat your heart out, Peter Frampton. 

It seems like two months
'Though I met her tonight
Something just told me
It would work out alright
So I asked her to act out
What was there in our heads
No need for games, babe,
Let's hop into bed
audience reacts, Harry says,  I figured that'd get ya. 
That's when I said

Oh, get on with it
Let's get it done
Life is made up of moments
Let's not miss this one
Oh, get on with it
Before it's too late
We know where we're going
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.

But that's when she says
Let's take it slowly
You don't really know me
If we make it holy
Maybe it will last
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.

Soon it's working so well
I got her moving in
All the permanent thoughts
Already begin
You see she is the woman
That I want for my wife
I say,  Let's set a date, babe,
And get on with our life.
And that's when I said again

Oh, get on with it
Let's get it done
Life is made up of moments
Let's not miss this one
Oh, get on with it
Before it's too late
We know where we're going
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.

But once again she says
Let's take it slowly
Still you don't know me
If we make it holy
Maybe it will last
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.

I don't know what happened
As we moved along
But all of a sudden
It came out all wrong
She said,  It's all over
Let's not drag out the end
If we split up now
Then at least we'll stay friends.
And that's when she said

Get on with it
You know it's all done
We had our moments
Don't dwell on this one
Oh, get on with it
You know it's too late
Oh, yes, it's all over
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.

But that's when I say
Let's take it slowly
You know how you know me
And once it was holy
Don't give up so fast
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.
