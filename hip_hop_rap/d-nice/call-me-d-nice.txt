older brother can ya hear me
wish you could see me feeling good right now
tell my mother I can see her
that I've been dreamin' and I can show you how
seems twenty years that we've been reelin'
but you lost that feelin' and me I lost the fear somehow
hey father where's the boy you bleeded hung dry and cheated
it's me and I took the fall for you
down the road they call yesterday
I found my moment in the sun
let's hope the sun will be as kind today
for only this much I pray that someday
from the underground with all our friends around to bring ya down
who'll be there to save me?
they could shake you down but you won't give in to the underground
older brother can ya see me wish you could be me
walkin' in these shoes
to feel the weight of my conviction mental addiction
has got me down and losin' sleep
so if I try to make it real older brother would ya hear me?
and if I try again to feel older brother could ya heal me?
who'll be there to save me?
older brother can ya hear me, wish you could see me
feelin' good right now
