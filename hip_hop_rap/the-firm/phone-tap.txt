[Nas]	Yo this Esco, who this?

[AZ]
What's the deally?
I just touched grounds down in Philly
Brought a pound with me, Feds floatin around silly
Tryin to find Lynn, bitch supposed to be in the Benz
Parked in row ten, her and that slow hoe Gwen
Should of known she was a bitch that we both could of boned
to post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone
But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes
I know the jewels
No time for them thoughts, too much to lose 
Just tryin to vibe until them hoes role with the ride
Where's your joy and pride?
You know little Des got your eyes

[Nas]
In the cut, drop-Z okay, the top's up
Left the mall bought Little Amal the toy truck
Your boy's what, three years old now, correct?
He and my daughter age neck and neck, they futures set
Trees got me wet, in the background's an old cassette
Fly Stephanie Mills shit
What's the deal with, all this shit I'm hearin up top 
You got arrested, shot a fair one with a cop
That ain't ya stee', you usually low key with no t
I'm only goin off of what some weak bitch told me

[AZ]
That's some ill shit, hear that bitch go with her click

[Nas]
Yo Dunn, 
I'll hit you right back cause the static is thick

[spanish speaker -> words unknown]

Chorus: Dr. Dre

We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do 
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two 
to make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do 
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two 
to make all it stick like glue, we got you

[AZ]
We just hit the cribbo, I'm curled up on this pillow
I'm still low, hold the ill news, these niggaz killed mo'
The shit touched me, tryin to chill just lit a dutchie 
from a while back - same foul cats who tried to bust me 
Caught 'em sleeppin, in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights right off the Deacon
Feel awful speakin, for some reason, feel the phone's tapped
Alone with gats left with a vest to watch my own back

[Nas]
Keep your eyes open - stay wide, shit is mind blowin
Look for any sign showin one-time is knowin
about the dynasty, shit is not minor leauges no more
Cats bleed in this cold war
Son we took an oath, then this life took us both
We rich now, milk the whole cow, split the growth 
Now I'm on the car doin, headlights on
Fluid in the windsheild wipes gone this light storm
that's formin in the sky, you comin home tomorrow?
Will you drive or will you fly - hold up, my other side

[Nature]
Yo son some other cats tried to ruin our plans
Sendin two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Askin your whereabouts - I gave 'em no leads 
For all the nigga know them hoes fuck with police

[Nas]
No shit I'm clickin over, I'ma tell Sos' quick
Son - them outta state bitches tryin to get us both hit
That was Nate, he hit me last night late while in my hoe's stomach
Said it's no hundred, we FBI's most wanted
So play the low, change your clothes, pack your bags
Watch what you say on this phone, get home fast

Chorus

[AZ]
Yo it's all good
I'ma hit you when I touch down tomorrow son, word

[Nas]
Stay on point - don't even use the phone
just come to my crib yo, word up

[AZ]
Out
