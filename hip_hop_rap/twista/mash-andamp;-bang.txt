[Turtle Banxx]
picture this shit you facing
totalin body and murderous situations against nations we organize like maces
got killers patiently waitin
different places you facing the yellow taping and federal x with graces
we ruinin your reputation
momma in the hospital pacing for every shot you taking
the doctors cant stop the shaking
see faces blazin
like the sun of satan like a gun that gets nathan
what you expect say what
like a neutron on deck yeah
nigga you gonna catch rays ha
you confess lets get cash and thangs ugh huh
smokin flash and range
cause we mash and bang
till the vet we slay ahhhhhhh

I'm all up in ya now
and when i blast you hear gunshot
feeling me now

well come swim with these killa piranhas
sharin heat orders slash g's and fours
street patrollers cant run when the gasket blows
your caskets close
my eyes open

and now I'm hoping you escape before crimes broken braids on the gallery
fat too many calories I'm ghost Mickey and Mallory

you ain't walking the austin and departing the ghetto carchers
some bledo when when the pistols echo and serve to protect em

[Bennie Franks]

I got killers that'll bang Jason in math terror
your replacements ask Nicholas Cage where ya face went
