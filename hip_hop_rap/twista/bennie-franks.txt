[Bennie Franks]
I drop bombs like who say mad ass
verbal ammunition when I solve a blast ass I stash cash
assassination like Ras Kass
bitches and 10 hut
I'ma money making soldier cause I don't give no fuck
the world is mine
you stepping over gages grenades and land mines so hand mine
if you was around nigga you probably ban mine
off the loado watching out for the rorrow popping at the po po
99 brinks truck candy apple sitting on normols
them niggas don't wanna see us come up
so fuck them marks for the legit ballers for the world blow up
its ain't no sold off shit I'm still top of the mess
check Tom disrespect Tom teflon through his chest
and fuck em for T
I'm rolling in my candle camouflage
wing ding and white wands and now I ready to march
embark on this who trying to whip the lyrical arsonist
look learn and listen my baguette still glisten
my nine shines its 6 past 6 so bitches prime time
who in they write mine nigga trying to define rhyme
L-E-G-I-T ballers
give it up for them pistol pistol the knuckle street baller
come on

its a sin to swallow all the witness now I'm guilty by suspicion
I know this shit got ya mind twisted so who I make concern
