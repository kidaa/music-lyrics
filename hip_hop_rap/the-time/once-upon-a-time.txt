Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But, that was once upon a time
Very long ago.

Once upon a time
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars
And waiting for the dawn
But, that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone.

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed
As though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young
And didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But, somehow once upon a time
Never comes again.
