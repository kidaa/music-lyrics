Streetsinger: 
I been waitin for you. 
You that famous little girl who's been lookin for her daddy now ain't ya?

Brooklyn: 
And who are you?

Streetsinger: 
Oh, they call me the Streetsinger. 
And I'll be your Magic Man in this fairytale.

Taylor: 
Our love will stay strong

Brooklyn & Taylor: 
La la la la, la la, la la la la

Taylor: 
Let our fate write words to this song.

Brooklyn: 
Once upon a time I believe in miracles. 
Once upon a time I believe that love will conquer all. 
Once upon a time I believe anything is possible 
And I believed again the moment when I saw you here tonight. 
Now once upon a time has never felt more right. 
Now once upon a time has never felt more right. 
Thank you Streetsing....Streetsinger?
