Brooklyn: 
La la la, la la la

Faith: 
Brooklyn

Brooklyn: 
Mommy? Mommy!

Faith: 
Oh Brooklyn, I'm sorry I didn't give you a happy ending, I know I stole that from you. 
Always keep the lullabye close to your heart, 
learn the truth about your father, it will help you to heal.

Brooklyn: 
But how? Where would I even...

Faith: 
Trust the voice inside of you Brooklyn. Follow it to America.

Brooklyn: sung 
Has anyone ever sung you a lullabye.

Faith: spoken 
There's magic in your music, and through your music, your father, he'll hear you

Brooklyn: sung 
You can fly above the rainclouds, close your eyes.

Faith: spoken 
Just let the melody carry you, leave all your fears behind

Brooklyn: sung 
Let the melody carry you, leave all your fears behind.

Faith: spoken 
And once upon a time will find you

Brooklyn: sung 
And float across the rainbow sky to once upon a time

Faith: 
Once upon a time

Brooklyn: 
I believe in miracles

Faith: 
Once upon a time

Brooklyn: 
I believe love will conquer all

Faith: 
Once upon a time 

Brooklyn: 
I believe anything is possible

Brooklyn and Faith: 
Now once upon a time has never felt more right.

Streetsinger: 
Well soon Faith's beautiful little girl became a famous young woman. 
Famous for her song, a song that finds the lost child in all of us. 
Oh, and now she's famous where it counts, where nothing but fame counts, America!

Taylor: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Carnigie Hall proudly welcomes Paris's amazing grace, Brooklyn!
