Taylor:
The world is a stage

All:
And we are the players

Taylor:
Sometimes a villain
Sometimes a savior

Do we choose our own roles?
Do we write our own lines?
A lifetime of asking
And I'm left with "sometimes"

All:
And "sometimes" has come

Taylor:
What role do I play?

All:
"Sometimes" is now

Taylor:
What words do I say?

Every star out in heaven
Shines on Brooklyn tonight
Do I stay in the shadows
Or stand in the light?

All:
Do you believe in happy endings?

Taylor:
Once upon a time I did

All:
Do you believe in happy endings?

Taylor:
Once upon a time I did

All:
Do you believe in happy endings?

Taylor:
Once upon a time I did

All:
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time

Taylor:
I saw my own eyes when I looked into hers
Such a beautiful child
She's all you once were

Like an angel she's flying
Much too close to the ground
Did you send her to fine me, faith?
I'm finally found

And "sometimes has come
What role do I play?
"Sometimes" is now
What words do I say?

Every star out in heaven
Shines on Brooklyn tonight
Do I stay in the shadows
Or stand in the light?

Every star out in heaven
Spells out Brooklyn tonight
Do I stay in the shadows
Or stand in the light?
