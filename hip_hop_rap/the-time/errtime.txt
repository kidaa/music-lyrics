the continental on blow got them feeling real glo
till they stomachs stick to, furr real, they grossed out

Just to see when they roll out, I'm killin the folks now
his money just chingy, my money it fold out

all my life damn worryin bout a meals worth

Yo yo yo
I'm def'er than Jermaine, you could say I'm so so
Player taylor made, thats a no no
Sure it a 'aftermath', but I ain't a doctor
Squad full of 'BG's', city full of them choppas
Way more 'Game' than the kid with the G-Unit
Cracks by the gram an hour, thats a G-Unit
Like Ciara when I'm keeping the 'Goodies'
Cuz' I'm Jazzy like Pha with a tank in the Hoody
I'm Like..

You see I'm tired of playin games with
niggaz with money names
For real money, you lame
I put your money to shame
Ha, this ain't cynical?
Naw This ain't subliminal
I'm physical, financial and mental to be a general
Why the momma types you want a {soldier}
Not the type that in the tank but in the {Rover}
yea man you at the game orderin refreshments
I'm on the floor watching my investment
Buttoned up, some call it grown up look
I like to call it havin money that fold up look
That Don Perignon, Chrystal cold up look
Got her whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Chorus]
