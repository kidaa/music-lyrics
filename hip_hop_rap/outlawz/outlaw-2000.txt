Without a worry in the world

And this Outlaw gang 
Gonna do a Outlaw thang

Verse 3: Kastro 
I wake up with a new 4 
Sleep with 2 4 
And a 12 gauge pump 
Waiting for something to jump 
Y'all must be kidding me 
Talking about ridding me 
Faggot 
This world is mines and I ain't having it 
Listen 
How it feel trying to steal 
A nigga you can't kill 
A nigga so real we make time stand still 
That's me 
Lil' OG

And one more 
My balls hang 
And I bang 
Till I'm stiff on the floor 
Oh no

Talking they self to death 
They gonna feel it again 
And that's that 
That's all 
That's it 
No more

Verse 4: 
Dirty jersey only breed 
Killers and dogs 
Since I'm both I'm in your driveway 
With gauge in the fog 
Ain't shit sweet about 
A nigga from New York 
Accept the not guilty verdict 
That you hear in the court 
Bang you from the car 
Rocking Me Against the World 
And the blood from your face fly and land on your girl 
I'm gunnin grown 
Even bag up coke when my mother home 
Just got the new gun 
That bust off with another tone 
Chorus: 1x 
Verse 5: Young Noble 
Yo

Stripper club shit 
Bitches giving love quick 
Fuck this we gonna take it there 
Nigga you wants no part of this

We catch you niggas slippin 
Then we take your block 
My homies stay creeping 
And we ride for 'Pac 
You know it ain't a thang 
And we ride for Yak 
You niggas know it ain't a game 
'Cause we bleed for this 
And if you don't believe in nothing else 
Believe in this

So come and get it nigga
