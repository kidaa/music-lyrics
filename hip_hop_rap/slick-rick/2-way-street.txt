Well I shot some there, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly draws flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
To what, Rick? To discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, ";Pardon me, mister";
Yes, I said cautiously
";Crazy, but possibly 
you could sign your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me";
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ";You can press down hard on it"; -
Now my hand browsing her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
";I love you";, forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:";You got a wife?"; 
Anniversary comin up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute Uh-huh
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
";I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya";
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid Say what?
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid

Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
";I love this";, being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me ";Rick, I think your album is incredible";
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
";You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye";
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressing Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emporer
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid Say what?
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid
