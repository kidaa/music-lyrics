+Well it started up on 8th Avenue
And I made up the name the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my true DJ Jerona, that would be 
My right hand man Ricky D.
I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things
For example, here's a telephone ting
ring, ring *Hello, is Doug E. Fresh here
No, he's not in right now
+But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be fresh to rock wit fresh
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E Fresh
And I'm know for the sound effects
Not for the sound effects
The human beat box on the entertainer
No other lable that fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainder
And I'm also known as a beat box trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I'm finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
You know it Slick Rick

*Wel, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, i was walking downtown Word Rick word
Sure All along, no one to be wit
Step on the D-train, 205th
I saw a pretty girl so
So I sat beside her
Then she went roar, she was Tony the Tiger
I said, oh darn, there has been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick, not frosty flake
oh, golly wolly She was raising hell
She said, um, my name is maggie but you can call me Michelle
Rick sings
Bust a move, we show and prove
Hey, yo, Doug, do that funky jam on a groove

Oh my God...
