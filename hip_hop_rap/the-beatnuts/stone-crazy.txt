Now, let me ask you this... off the record.
	Is it true what they say about how they... smoke a lot of, y'know...

Yeah, yeah
Everybody get up, Beatnuts
World's Famous, no doubt!
Straight out the laboratory
Fuck, what?
What?

	Your mother sucks cocks, and your father

[JuJu]
I beat too savagely, it doesn't even matter to me
I hold this down like gravity, reality
is unloaded, the foul mouthed brain exploded
The gun-totin, the Charles Manson pres votin
The bitch chokin, the hydro cheeba smokin
Leave ya witcha nose broken, the ill spoken
Killer, fuck your little girl like Magilla
The wild Gorilla, gun down Barney Miller
Ahhh!

	Yo, fuck these niggaz yo, they violent, they violent
	Yo, yo, what the fuck you doin yo?  Punk?
	Can't shoot a cop son!

*singing* You must be stone crazy 4X

[Psycho Les]
Here's my ultimatum, niggaz don't have my shit laced
No question, little did you know, you came here for confession
Cross-examination, my organization stack figures
And when you fuck up we chop heads, no fingers
Fuckin around, with those Beatnut niggaz
Now you missin body dumped in different rivers
Full-fledged rapper with the Stone Crazy singer
I'm comin at you with the ice pick yellin ?Bre vega?
Because I perceive you a sneaky, analyzer
Touch the equalizer, get shot by the tranquilizer
Who shot ya?
Who?  The bilingual mandingo, roll trees
but prefer leaves, don't give a fuck about drug beefs
Peep the headlines, stay high
Twenty-four/seven, lali out with the red eyes

*singin* You must be stone crazy repeat 4X

Intoxicated, intoxicated, intoxicated
Fuck you was thinkin nigga?  Fuck you was on?

	Round and around and around and around
	And around and around and around we go
Yo, Beatnuts, World's Famous
	Round and around and around and around
	And around and around and around we go
Yo, drinkin a glass of Prozac so get the Bozack
