You left it, I sent it 
I want it back 
You left it, I sent it 
I want it back 

If I had you here, I'd clip your wings 
Snap you up and leave you sprawling on my pin 
This plan of mine is oh so very lame 
Can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 

You left, I died, 
I went and you cried 
You came, I think 
But I never really know 
I've served my time 
I've watched you climb 
The wrong incline 
But what do I know 

Accept it, Don't let it 
Turn the screw 
Accept it, And let it 
Scream back at you 

Now this applies both equally to you and I 
The only thing we share 
Is the same sky 
These empty metaphors 
They're all in vain 
Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 

In the garden Snake was a charmin' 
And Eve said let's give it a try 
Now lead us not into temptation 
But no matter how hard I try 
When in the garden and 
Snake is a charmin' 
And Eve says let's give it a try 
Eve is the apple of my eye 

And I lie behind you 
And a cradle you in the palm of me 
And I pat your hair down 
I think will we sink or swim? 
'Cause we could do either on a whim
