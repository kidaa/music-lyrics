This is a brand new problem, a problem without any clues
If you know the clues it's easy to get through 

But you look confused and you dont know what to do
Its hard to get an answer when you havent got a clue
If you work it out tell me what you find

If the least you can do is show some restraint 
Then the most you can do is get carried away 

But you look confused and you dont know what to do
Say what you see, what you like
If you work it out tell me what you find
We can have a few decent days and nights

If you're meant to be here and you wnat to be late
The best thing you can do is get lost on the way 

I can see that you look confused and you dont know what to do
Say what you see, what you like
If you work it out tell me what you find
We can have a few decent days and nights

If you want to make a guess you should know its not a game
'cause you'll never get a chance to make another guess again
