Da first nigga to slip's
the first nigga I'm a trip on
get my flip on lay em down N
get my dip on out the back door
see my Benzo I'm in it I pull a jack in a minute
got dem Hoochy's gettin' freaky in the
backroom cuz on the microphone I'm
funky like the bathroom
it's just a new Generation of invincble 'G's
we got mic's N gatz N nutz
hangin' to our knees at ease nigga freeze
If you step into my area I carry a strong
mind flo till I'm blind

lookin' for a dime need to get my head
right now watch me flo so tight

[Bridge 1]
It's party time and the sun has got me goin' wild
I loose my mind all these Hunny's running all around

and it don't stop till we POP cuz we droppin' dem cutz

Now it's another day in the mid of the summer

It's the mister lookin' real hard the catch

the sack so step back trippin' how I break
the back now just to to set it off as I know
behavior you catch the track on time you know

to breathe listen then stop and letem freeze
