Take this broken wings and learn to fly again and learn to live so free 
and when we here the voices sing the book of love will open up and let us in 
so take these broken wings

Creapin' up on the microphone, It's C-Block we dippin' clean 
floss with the funky flavour down with Misty - N - Goldie G 
we rippin this hit near rappin' the shit 
we layin' the tracks and flippin' the script 
droppin' the lyrics producin' a song 
checked the mic 1-2 its' on 
rigity Red, bigity Black, get up with this you can't go back 
tisket tasked cock the hamma blast it 
homies try to flex your pain rest in a casket 
you're takin' a chance you're rollin' the dice 
you loose your luck you loose your life 
check yourself punk before a reck that ass punk 
don't make me have to take you for a ride in my trunk 
I said excuses, excuses, I'm not tryin' to hear your stle is boody 
by nature so get on out here 
ya said ya could have necked the mic but you came to late 
you said you could hyped the crowd, but your shit sounds fake 
you would have stepped up on the stage but you was scared to get slammed 
you woulda, you coulda, you shoulda, but you didn't Damn!

Broken wings, symbolistic of another statistic 
in this jungle scene gone ballistic 
realisticly the buck stops on an innocent child 
with the word "can't" spoken from a white smile 
a system made to degrate dictate on the uneducated 
and then wanna fade frustrated, brothas when they infiltrate it, 
souls lost to blaze like bombay struttin with a sashay till doomsday per se 
now I'ma flip this session over to the positive, 
so listen closely to the message that I'm  ganna give 
I refuse to misuse my god given talent, 
and induce to diffuse all those who are mad about it 
and if you're seeking to take your life upon another status, 
you need to believe that if you lean you need to get back it 
and when you're struggling in this game, just put your head up high, 
the skills will come to mend your wings and fly
