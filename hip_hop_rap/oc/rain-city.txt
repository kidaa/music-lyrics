Opened my eyes had a dream last night that both my arms were broken,
Evening time,
Help me now or hold me down, i feel the world is tumbling,
Spiralling down,
Oh my love i can`t let go,
Somethings wrong i can`t let go,
Natures cruel shes laughing,
As i feel my way through the century,
As i slowly turn to house dust,
Tumbling down,
The rain comes down like a victory,
In sheets of shining memory,
Over and over,
Circling around,
Oh my love i can`t let go,
Somethings wrong i can`t let go,
Natures cruel shes laughing,
Almost too much for my heart,
When it rains,
Oh tears my soul apart,
When it rains,
Almost too much for my heart,
In a dream,
Oh tears my soul apart,
The rain clouds move so slowly,
Above the city,
Where i`m from
