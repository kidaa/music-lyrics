Now I really don't care about
no nigga tryin to slang
and I really don't give a fuck
about no nigga tryin to Bang
cuz we got, hand times commin
down like rainy weather
we can buck N shoot em up
or we can all rize together
with the price in your eyes
the pep in our step I'm tryin to
spit the message out until I reach
my last breath my physical awarness
plus my continous mind plus the Live
microphone equals righteous rhyme
so you know I'm flowin' like H2O
then fountain non-stop to a thirsty soul
I be like, cupid draw back my bow
point it at your mind N let my fly rhyme go
cuz I, a man born to die small speak on
till I'm carried by six to my restin' home
cuz I'm a hoochy fader
devastader, real Busta Hater
the hommy's call me "G" cuz I'm
g-g-greater on the microphone
splurgin cut snakes like a surgeon
and Busta you can't fade cuz
I flow tight like a virgin
Chorus:
Being raised as a "G"
it ain't the easiest thang to be
Runnin' - Gunnin' - Ridin' - Rollin'
Hey-Aye It's got the best of me
As I grow you watch me come
with the smooth flow. Cause you
know Mr. P don't stop I let it go.
Now I'm comin up. Cause it's the thing
to do cause I brought yall on this track
you see I thought yall knew another black man
I got the master plan and I'm twisted comin
back so yall can understand because it's
in me I'm comin deep like the sea and
I'm swimmin in this mystical frame.
You see I'm off express mode cause I deliver
my own and I'm wishin and I'm hoping I can
sit on my throne, I'm all alone.
I'm pushing 2 times to yall dome.
It's my brain and I'm wishin you well can't
you feel that I was born I had the mission
right from the start then I carried it then
I burried it so listen up cause I got to tell
you one more time stay real and stay up
as I kick my rhyme's.
Chorus
