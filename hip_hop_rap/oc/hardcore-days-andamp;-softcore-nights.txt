don't ever ask me where i go
last man who asked me had to go
because if you start asking
then i'll be hostile acting
don't ever ask me where i go

don't ever ask me where i'm from
in six states that's considered dumb
because if you start asking
i'll pull this heat i'm packing
don't ever ask me where i'm from

i've never been beaten
i won't stop competing
don't ever ask me where i'm from
i get the red out
when i take my lead out
don't ever ask me where i'm from

in six states that's considered dumb
don't ever ask me where i go
just thought i out to let you know
because if you start asking
then i'll be hostile acting
