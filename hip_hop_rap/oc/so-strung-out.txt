Now I'm all alone, sittin in my room in a corner
starring at the wall and I'm wishin I was on a
mission but I'm fishion in an empty bowl
cocain got my brain and I'm sweatin' cause I'm ice cold
hold on for a minute what's that sound
raise up to my feet paranoid lookin' all around
up down on the ground is it reality
damn I always feel like somebody's watchin me
now let me find another plan lookin for a plot
lookin for the man with the sack to get got
shot lay him down cause it don't be makin' me none
cocain on my brain and I gotta' get me some - !!
Chorus:
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
should I just take my life away
dear god or will you pull me trough?
I'm so strung out some how my life
has gone astray
so as I lay me down to sleep
please lord now take my soul away!
ohh ohhho ohhho / ohh ohhho ohhho
Another mystery sittin in anoter room
at twelve noon I hope that someting
happen soon I'm crawlin still burning
my knee' at 45 degrees
I'm saying please let it be somethig
in a form of a rock I can't stop
cause the spot getting hot tick tock
I see the devil clear in my past it can't last
because I'm running out of cash
a stash I remember from december
my mind gone blank and it could have
been november now as I feel myself blink
I look at the world one time and then I think
Chorus
I'm so strung out, I don't know what to do
should I take my life away dear God
or will you pull me trough, will you pull me trough
I'm so strung out, I'm so strung out
I know that you now that you
living real trife
so lay down that pipe and think
pick back up your life
just take it away
please god just take
it away won't you
just give another day to me
Chorus
