music: A. Humpe 

Baby, I know about the trouble that you've had with me 
And that you're furious and upset and mad at me 
And I know I must have hurt you in every single way 
And you know I saw you cryin' on every single day 

But I was livin' in the fast lane and left you behind, 
I didn't treat you right and I didn't treat you kind. 
I wish that we could just forget all the bad times, 
'Cause I need you right here, right at my side 

'Cause every day you helped me up when I was down 
And every day you picked me up when I was on the ground, 
Every day I wish we could turn back the hands of time 
And then you'd still be mine. 

Refrain:
Now I'm knockin' on your door 
I want you rollin' on the floor 
This time it's different than before 
You've had enough but I want more 
Now I'm ringing on your bell on my bell 
I'm so lonely, you can tell I can tell 
Now you're gone and you are well I am well 
Can't you see, I feel like hell 

I just wanna hold you the way I held you way back when, 
Before the shouting, the screaming and the trouble began, 
And I'm sure I wouldn't make the same mistakes that I've done 
Because the saying's true, you don't know what you got til it's gone 

I should have noticed before that something wasn't going right, 
I should have been there when you waited for me all night, 
I should have helped you when you needed me and pleaded with me, 
I should have treated you the same way that you treated me. 

'Cause every day you helped me up when I was down 
And every day you picked me up when I was on the ground, 
Every day I wish we could turn back the hands of time 
And then you'd still be mine.
