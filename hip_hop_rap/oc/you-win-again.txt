[Hook Misty:]
There's so fight, you can't fight this battle of love with me, you win again 
so little time we do nothing but compete 
There's no life on earth no other could see me through, you win again 
some never try but if anybody can we can 

C-Block in the house for the Bee Gees 

[Rap1a Red Dogg:]
Yeah, we representin with this Bee Gee's thang, 
CBK is what I'm screaming that's the click I claim 
I keeps my head up game tight errect be my spine 
I manage to stay real because my heart controls my mind 
plus my God given gift is interwined with my soul 
I set it down with my brain n left if ferment like pruno 
now you know I like to shake the spot like that 
comin' thru, stayin true because we hop like that 

[Rap 1b Goldie:]
A true dat I'm wit dat and thats a fact CBK on dis track 
and you know we comin' phat 
If you didn't know now you know Goldie flow 
peep the style for a while so you can feel the ruck us 
Red Dogg, Misty with me you know you can't stop us 
blowin leaves of da trees with the keys from the Bee Gee's 
Toneway's got our back so we don't have a need

[Rap 2a Red Dogg:]
I'm holding everything down blessed by the man 
tryin to maintain sight n keep the upper hand in this dirty game 
whwre nothing ever seem to change, bustas acting kinda shady 
like they minds rearrenged 
tell me what's the quickest way you could loose your fame 
turn your back and walk away from the click you claim 
and as the clock continues to turn you let the bridges burn 
you wasn't worthy of the love that we CBK earned 

[Rap 2b Goldie:]
Jealousy and envy it is the public enemy 
I try to always love becuz it's in me 
a lot of MC's produce key's of negetivity 
but I'm stay real so you can feel my positivity 
love their neighbour show respect till the end 
everyone you meet you can't truss the like they can 
look to the hills from whence cometh' all 
live, pray and prosper or fall 

[Hook 'til end]
