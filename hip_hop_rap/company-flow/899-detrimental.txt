[El-P]
For all intents and purposes I ram pride
Resonate pussy rapper get the long donkey cock
I keep telethon MC's clinging to Jerry's person
Motherfuckin Tourette's syndrome MC's can't freestyle without rehearsing
Crossed T's and dotted I's but still caught a liquid shit surprise
Rappers got on colored contacts but they better real-eyes
Contact CoFlow shit equals El, Bigg Jus distortion
Try to merk off on our pile but you choked on my fuckin portion
You oughta scream, got my name up in your mouth like cock or gingivitis
When every rhyme becomes the official new blueprint for wannabe writers
I don't mind you talkin shit just keep it in the first person
Think realistically if you diss me could you handle my rebuttal version
Then again if you spit my name it only means you recognize my status
I flip the script use your little diss as a promotional apparatus
I'll ignore you sellin crack, killin people, and keepin it real
but disrespect me and my adopted fam and die young like veal
When miscellaneous MC's drop they spontaneous
bullshit metaphor, the outcome is always obvious
When that piece of shit Mother Time gets cut short in 1999
I'll be stress-free, knowin that while I was on Earth I got mine

8 Steps to Perfection, the sum of each part forms an octagon
