What is love
That I'm deserving now
That you would give to me
Exclusively
To have and to hold selfishly
I said if I should try to share with you a life
And with all I am and I
I'll show you that magic is still alive
Yes, I will
I promise till I die that I won't let go
Of your heart that's in my hands

Darling let me know
If there's anything your heart needs
I'll work vigorously
Just to keep you happy
Just let me know
If there's a dream you should ever seek
I'll make reality
Say I do and I'll show you

The finer thing's in life
I'll even take you on a carpet ride
All across your mind
And we'll fly across blue skies and crystal lights
'Cause you're the twinkle in my eye
Sometimes just lookin' at you makes me cry
Oh, I, I thank you God for two lives unified
You're the missing link that makes my life complete
And, Honey

Darling let me know
If there's anything your heart needs
I'll sail from sea to sea
Just to keep you happy
Just let me know
If there's a dream you should ever seek
I'll make reality
Say I do and I'll show you

There is no mountain that we cannot move, Yeah
There is no flower that our love cannot grow
There is no hill that our pride cannot climb
We'll last and last forever
Body and soul

Darling let me know 
If there's anything your heart needs
I'll work vigorously, Oh yes I will
To make you happy
Just let me know
If there's a dream you should ever seek
I'll make reality, Yeah
Say I do and I'll show you

Say I do and I'll show you
