It was Harlem at the rukus 
      I saw you with your man, a smile on your face, huh, 
      A coach bag in your hand 
      I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back 
      We caught eyes for a moment and that was that 
      So I skated off as you strolled off 
      Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft so fine 
      I gotta take you from your man, that's my mission 
      If his love is real he's got to handle competition 
      You only knew him for five months, that's right 
      Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts 
      And I'll be working out everyday thinking about you 
      Looking at my own eyes in the rear view 
      Catching flashbacks of our eye contact 
      Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back 
      I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears 
      I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years 

      CHORUS:
      Hey lover, hey lover,
      This is more than a crush, 
      Hey lover, hey lover, 
      This is more than a crush, lover, 
      Hey lover, this is more than a crush, 
      Hey lover, hey lover, 
      This is more than a crush 

      I see you at the bus stop waiting every day 
      Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way 
      And I don't want to violate your relationship 
      So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip 
      Still he can't stop me from having daydreams 
      Tongue'n you down with huh, vanilla ice cream 
      Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight 
      Searching you body with my tongue girl all night 
      I wonder one day could it be, I wonder 
      Simple dreams could turn into reality 
      Our love would come down so naturally 
      We would walk down the aisle of destiny 
      Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared 
      Break your off a little chump change to do your hair 
      It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs 
      But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead 

      REPEAT CHORUS.

      Last week I saw you at the mall 
      Standing at the pay phone about to make a call 
      I had a vision it was me on the other end 
      Telling you come by and then you walked in 
      I touched you gently with my hands 
      We talked about traveling to distant lands 
      Escaping all the madness out here in the world 
      Becoming my wife no longer my girl 
      Then you let your dress fall down to the floor 
      I kissed you softly and you yearned for more 
      We experienced pleasure unparalleled 
      Into an ocean of love we both fell 
      Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss 
      Fantasies interchanging with each kiss 
      Undying passion unites our souls 
      Together we swim until the point of no control 
      But, it's a fantasy, it won't come true 
      We never even spoke and your man swears he loves you 
      So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings inside, that's right 
      Keep my dreams alive until the right time 

      REPEAT CHORUS.
