Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh ohh

I don't understand your thinking
I thought we were happy, guess I was mistaken
Gave you all my love and my attention
Say you don't want me
Cuz something is missing
Gave you all you wanted and you know it's true
All that I was doin' meant nothing to you
And if I told you why, we'd probably be cool
But I was good to you, so good

But you want a guy that's real nice
That'll spend all his dough and his time
But then you change your mind and want a thug guy
Who won't act right
It doesn't pay to be the good guy

You callin' me late nights
Tellin' me how he won't act right
Stay with him but he makes you cry
Tell me why
It doesn't pay to be the good guy
'Cause every time I'll be right

I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted,throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

I don't understand your reason
Sayin' you love me, then sayin' your leavin'
The situation here has really changed me
Don't wanna fall in love cuz you play me oh
You gotta be kiddin' me no
You tryin' to get rid of me
I did more for you than any brother would do
I was good to you, so good to you

Plus you want a guy that's real nice
That'll spend all his dough and his time
But then you change your mind and want a thug guy
Who won't act right
It doesn't pay to be the good guy

You callin' me late nights
Tellin' me how he won't act right
Stay with him but he makes you cry
Tell me why
It doesn't pay to be the good guy
'Cause every time I'll be right

I was good to you I played the fool 
Played the fool for you
You messed it up for the next girl in my life
I'll never do the things I do for you
Our love just wasn't true
I was good to you, so good to you
So good to you
Every time I try...
