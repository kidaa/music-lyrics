To ease the pain
Of changing from Boyz II Men
No one to guide me
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain

To ease the pain
Of changing from Boyz II Men
No one to guide me
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
Of changing from Boyz II Men
Here we go again
