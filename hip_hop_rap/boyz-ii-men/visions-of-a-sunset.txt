Oh Yeah 
Lived all my days trying to embrace 
Life with my heart by all the beauty 
I feel and create it spins and moves 
Flows at my pace telling its story 
From the tear running down my face 

[Chorus:] 
Visions of a sunset just appear when 
I close my eyes 
Takes my closer to heaven when the 
Flute starts to fly 
And the violin cries 

Confusion leaves while peace 
Orchestrates runs through my 
Veins and in other seekers it 
Penetrates my reason why 
The big city air smells so 
Sweet takes me through journeys 
In time from my youth to as 
Far as I can see 

[Chorus ]

It's all I need in my life 
It's all I need and no one 
Can take your place by my side 
You're all inside of me 

[Chorus ]

We'll free from all sorrow 
Like the wind blows from the sky 
Takes me closer to 
Heaven when the 
Flute starts to fly
