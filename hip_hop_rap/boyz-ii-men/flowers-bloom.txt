There is nothing glamorous in this simple town
But there's this special flower that can only bloom right here
And all the heavy burdens in our heart,
Get carried away
The wind can smooth the wrinkles of the past

Like a dazzling reflection in the sky
I hear the distant calling of the ancient ripples of the sea
And I realise that your laughter reminds me
Of the soothing sound of the gentle ocean

[Wanya]
And your heart can't cover up the look of loneliness
You don't have to reveal it to me
But anytime you need it
These faces so familiar in your heart
Wait for you to reach to their hands

I want to know if that place
That I've been once before
Hasn't ever changed
And remains the place that always will be there for me
Till the last goodbye ill cherish it
And I can't stop looking back to see
That you're smiling waving back at me
Gonna bite my lips not to cry
And I'm trying to fight this feeling
But the tears may get so hard to see
Ill be waiting for the day
We can reunite again
Where the flowers bloom
For Jus me and you

[Shawn]
There is something that the shadows can't explain
Something so simple and so obvious, that we forget
Behind the cloudy surface of it all, if we look up above
We'll see the sun shine illuminate everything we see
All the past and present faces here are all to stay
Each prayer wishes new memories
Im proud to have it all
These memories alive inside my heart
Blossoming vividly one by one

After the rain the roads are muddy and there's puddles everywhere
And we clearly see all the footsteps in this journey thru this life we lead
And I pray these tears can find a way and breathe life back into the day
When the weltered petals in my heart once again blossoming
And ill whisper to the ocean breeze and my wish will soar above the seas
And a rainbow in the sky will appear for you and i
Glistening in the sun, shine for everyone

[Wanya, Shawn]
Hey, the only place where the flowers bloom
The only place where this wind can blow
The only place you can hear this song
The only place you can see these sign
Hey, the only place where the flowers bloom
The only place where this wind can blow

[Shawn]
I want to know if that place
That I've been once before
Hasn't ever changed
And remains the place that always will be there for me
And ill try to fight this feeling
But the tears may get so hard to see
Ill be waiting for the day
We can reunite again

[Wanya]
After the rain the roads are muddy and there's puddles everywhere
And we clearly see the footsteps in this journey thru this life we lead
I try to fight this loneliness
But the tears may get so hard to see
Even thru the scars and memories
I won't forget you and me
So radiantly shining thru
The horizon as it rises high
And the wind carries it star beneath the memories
Ooh still im waiting for you
