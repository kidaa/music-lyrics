Dear God, it's me again 
I am so far from where I could have been 
Dear God, I would be incomplete 
But you came and touched my life in time of need 
So I'm thanking you for all you've done 
And for sacrificing your only song 

[Chorus: ]
That's why I'm writing you this letter 
To let you know that I love you 
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend 
Lord, my love for you will never end 

Dear God, it's Shawn this time 
I'm so grateful for the way you've changed my life 
I'd give all I have, I'd just throw it all away 
For a chance to walk with you through Heaven's gates 
That's why I'm thanking you for your love and your grace 
I don't deserve these blessings that you give me 

[Chorus ]

[interlude]
Dear God, as a humble man I come to you like a child 
Needing your knowledge, your love, and your guidance, Lord 
Thank you for trusting me with my own life's decisions 
But I'm just a man, and I don't deserve 
This incredible life that you've given me 
I love you Lord, I love you 

Dear God, it's me Wanya 
I'm so sorry, so sorry for living for me 
But I promise from this day on I'm livin' for you 
Cause without you my life means nothing 

[Chorus ]
