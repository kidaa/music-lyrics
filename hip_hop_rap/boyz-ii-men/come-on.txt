[Chorus: ]
Do you really wanna rock tonight 
Come on come on come on come on 
And if you feel that the vibe is right 
Come on come on come on come on 
Say you really wanna get your body tonight 
Come on 
We can dance if you wanna dance 
All night come on come on 

We can clear the floor tonight 
And so much more tonight 
I'm feelin' so good 
Wanna dance the night away with you 
Hey DJ, play my song 
Wanna party all night long 
If you feel what I'm feeling don't be scared to join in 
Come on 

[Chorus ]

Girl, I've been peeping you 
And you've been peeping me 
Baby let's not waste any more time 
Cause I know you want to 
Got real close to me 
Cause we felt so easy 
The way you move your body looks so fine, fine 
You got me hypnotized 
The way you look into my eyes 
And how you wear your hair 
And oh the stylish clothes you wear 
When you walked in the room 
I knew that it was on 
And I hope that this feeling 
Goes on and on, come on 

[Chorus ]

[Chorus ]

If you wanna dance 
Come on and take a chance 
If you wanna dance with me 
Do you wanna move 
I can make you move 
Do you wanna move with me 
With me 

[Chorus ]
