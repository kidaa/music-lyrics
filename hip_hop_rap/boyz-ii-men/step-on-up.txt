Been working hard everyday 
run from 9 to 5
I need a place to get away 
Where I can feel alive
Seems like my drama, it won't ever cease 
The haters stay awake
Now it's time to find my inner peace 
I'm coming out to play

This will be my night
I'm a get up on this floor
And lose what's left of my mind
Let the rhythm take control

[1] - Step on up, let your body go
Cuz I know you wanna do it so
When you hear the groove
You better know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now

This party's got me feeling right, yeah
I found a place to unwind, oh yeah
I'm diggin' on myself tonight
Relax and ease your mind
Ain't holdin' back, I'm gonna let it go
And throw all my cares away, yeah yeah
Now I'll be sure to let my feelings flow
I'm coming out to play

This will be my night, yeah
I'm a get up on this floor
And lose the best of my mind
Let the rhythm take control

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

It ain't no time to wait
Gotta get on before it's gone
Before it's too late
Make it happen all night long

[Repeat 1 to fade]
