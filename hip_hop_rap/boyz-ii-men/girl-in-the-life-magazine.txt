I fell in love with the girl in the picture 
That I used to keep 
Carried her 'round in the back of my pocket 
She was always with me 
I imagine that I was a man of importance 
And she had a fancy for me 
And I use to dream she would call 
Crying her eyes out 
She had an obsession with me 
I was the love of her life 
And she was all mine 
The girl in the Life magazine 

The first time I we met in an aisle 
At the market 
She was staring at me 
I knew even then we would share 
Something special 
And it was like chemistry 
I fell in love from the moment I saw her 
So I took her straight home with me 
And that's where I'd dream 
She would step right out of the picture 
And spend a whole evening with me 
And oh how she hated to go 
Back to her picture 
The girl in the Life magazine 

All of my friends used to laugh 
Said I was certifiably mad 
'Till the day she came 
And she blew them away 
And asked me if I'd be her man 
It seems that she went and fell 
In love with my letters 
Says she's been looking for me 
So the story ends well 
We end up together 
The girl in the Life magazine
