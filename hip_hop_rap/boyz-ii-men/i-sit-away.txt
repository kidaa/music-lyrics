Who says the sea can't move in winter 
Or clouds stand still in a storm 
Who says a man can't cry 
And be lonely 
Who says a man can't tend to be bored 
And if you could see inside my heart 
You would see loneliness 
And if I could show you my mind 
You would be depressed 

[Chorus:]
Said I sit away lonely 
And I get away only in my mind 
Said I sit away lonely 
And I get away sometimes 

So I'll gather my things 
And be on my way 
Into my lonely place 
Said I'm feelin' lonely and lonesome 
And I just need to get away 
And if you could know what I'm afraid of 
You would be frightened 
And if you could feel the pain that 
I'm feelin' 
Then you would know why, I 

[Chorus]

[Breakdown:]
Sit away 
Said I get away 
Said I sit away 
Said I sit away 
Why do I feel 
Like I will never be loved again 
There I go 
Back in my mood again 
Lonely, lonely 

[Chorus]
