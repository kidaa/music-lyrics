[Verse One] - [Wanya]
Lying here 
With my arms above my head 
Hungry for your love 
Waiting to be fed 
Your body speaks to mine 
And I understood every word 
Told me that you needed me 
At least that's what I heard 
I'm trying to hold on 
But I don't know for how long... 

[Talk] - [Mike] 
Don't make me wait too long... 

Oouuehhh... 

[Chorus ]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me right 
ooehhh...ooehhh... 
Breathe me, taste me, touch me, take me in your arms tonight 
All I want to do is 
Watch you watch me, feel you fill me up with pure delight 
That makes it easier to love you 
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me right, love me right... 

[Verse Two] - [Shawn ]
Why don't you tell me what you want from me girl 
Let me dive into your ocean 
I can find your precious pearl I can find your precious pearl 
As the moon evades our bedroom 
And reveals the sweat on your back on your back...yeeaahhh 
It increases my intensity to go there and never come back 
I'm trying to hold on 
To hold on 
But I don't know for how long... 
Yeeeaaahhhh... 

[Chorus ]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me right 
come on 
Breathe me, taste me, touch me touch me baby, take me in your arms tonight 
All I want to do is 
Watch you watch me, feel you fill me up with pure delight fill me up with pure delight 
That makes it easier to love you 
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me right, love me right... 

[Bridge ]
Oh how you tease me 
Driving me crazy 
Want you to please me 
So come on lady 
Close enough to touch 
She takes a step back 
See her getting excited 
By the way I react 
Moving in slow 
I can smell her perfume she smells so good 
She's moving closer still 
I know my time's coming soon oohh make it comes 
Lady are you ready 
Can't take it no more 
Ooh I don't think you're ready 
For all that I have in store 
I'm trying to hold on 
But I don't know for how long 
C'mon girl, I need you, take me right now
