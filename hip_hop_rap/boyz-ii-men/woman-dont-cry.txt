So you're feelin' lonely
Like love has gone away at night
You're brokenhearted cause your man ain't never done you right
You feel discouraged, feel like loving nothing but love
You're brokenhearted
Take another teardrop from your eyes, I'm telling you

No woman don't cry
Promise I will be by your side
I want you to know that love is a lie Yes it is
And love don't want no woman to cry

I can hear you thunder
I can feel the pain in your eyes
I can smell the flowers that he never gave on Valentine's

Don't be discouraged cause he wasn't right
I know your heart is broken
But I promise you that you're those survivors I'm tellin you

No woman don't cry
Promise I will be by your side
I want you to know that love is a lie
And love don't want no woman to cry

You gave him your love
You gave him your soul
You gave him your money
You gave him a home
Well all he ever gave you
Was a broken heart
Well girl I'm right here standing with love

No woman don't cry
Promise I will be by your side
I want you to know that love is a lie
And love don't want no woman to cry

Oh... no
