I know you've been going through some things
The pain you hold inside's written on your face
I know you're 'bout tired of the rain
Well, baby, so am I, but I know things can change
Well, you can die, you can sigh, you can cry, to your midnight blue
But that's not you, no, no
Cause I know you're stronger
It's apparent to me so do you

[Chorus:]
If you just hold on
I swear everything'll be okay
I know you're nervous
I know, but baby, give it some time
Things will go your way, my love
If you just hold on
I swear everything'll be okay
I know that you're nervous
Baby, give it some time
Things will go your way

I know it's been heavy on your mind
Baby, give him up, he's not worth your time
Where is it that says you need a guy
Well, you don't need his love to justify your life
So, he can go, let him go, make him go
You should want him to
So can you
I know that you're stronger
It's getting clearer to me
So do you

[Chorus]

So, don't let your defenses down
I know that somehow you'll work it out
I know
You should just believe in yourself, yourself

[Chorus]

I know
I know
[Fade out]
