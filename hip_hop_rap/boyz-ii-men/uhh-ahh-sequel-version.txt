      [Nathan] 
      In a minute, we'll be finished 
      Was I all that you hoped and dreamed? 
      Was I strong enough? Strong enough 
      To make you feel me, did I dig too deep in your mind? 

      [Wanya] 
      You were thinking of ways 
      To make me work for something good but wanted 
      All through the night, all I heard you say was... 

      Repeat 1 

      [Shawn] 
      Now that we're done, what are you thinking? 
      Should we talk about it baby? 

      [Nathan] 
      You look so beautiful laying there 

      [Wanya] 
      With the moonlight shining on you through the shades 

      [Shawn] 
      What has come over me? 
      Ohh, you feel so good 
      Ohh, you feel so good 

      [Michael] 
      Let's do it again 

      Repeat 1 
      Repeat 1 

      [Shawn] 
      Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh 

      [Michael] 
      Toss and turn, back and forth 
      The love grows, as the night flows 
      Ever so smoothly 
      I move you as you groove me 
      Taking our time as our bodies 
      Join to extract pure satisfaction 
      Holdin' and moldin', while I'm watching your reactions 
      To pure bliss 
      As I rub and kiss 
      Every pleasure ? from moments like this 

      Repeat 1 to fade w/ad-libs
