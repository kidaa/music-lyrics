I know that your heart has been so heavy baby
Tryin' to find peace of mind
Thinkin' 'bout him all the time
You gotta clear those guilty feelings lady
Gave him everything you had
That's no cause for feeling bad

Girl, I know you
You're too strong to
Let a man who don't understand 
Turn it 'round on you
So don't take all the weight
You can still be who you wanna be
If you have it in your heart

Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into 
Thinkin' that it's all your fault
Cuz you've got a right baby
To want a love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want

I understand your frustrations lady
You've been there far too long for 
Him to ever treat you wrong
Now you gotta learn to live for you, lady
Let your mind be inspiration now
Cuz your heart alone won't do

Girl, I know you
You're too strong to
Let a man who don't understand 
Turn it 'round on you
So don't take all the weight
You can still be who you wanna be
If you have it in your heart

Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into 
Thinkin' that it's all your fault
Cuz you've got a right baby
To want a love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want

Baby, it's no how, and no way
I will never make your heart break
Never let you go astray
Girl you deserve the very best that love has to give
I will put up a fight, I'll do everything right
As long as I live, I'll give all I can give

Know what you want
Don't let him break your heart
Don't let him trick you into 
Thinkin' that it's all your fault
Cuz you've got a right baby
To want a love
Who will be anything and everything
Anytime you want
