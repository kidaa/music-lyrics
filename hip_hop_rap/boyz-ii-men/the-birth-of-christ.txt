Well they traveled over hills and mountains
      On a cold December night just like this
      For they knew what was going to happen
      Mary would give birth to the prince of peace
      Our Lord


      From the manjor what they saw in the distance
      Was a misty silloutte of three kings
      Bringing all the most prescious jewels to our savior
      Knowing he would soon be called the king of kings
      Our Lord


      Chorus:
      On Christmas day
      They saw a star in the east and followed it
      On Christmas day
      That marked the birth place of our Lord and Savior
      Jesus Christ


      All free from sin
      Here to give us a chance at everlasting life again
      So the world
      So cold you better let him in
      To your heart


      From the sight of the blessed child was full of beauty
      As they looked upon the one who would save our world
      To their knees they dropped and started to worship
      Giving thanks to God above for the prince of peace
      Our Lord


      No one knew back then that on that evening
      That the miracle of miracles came true
      That a God above would come down from heaven
      In the form of a child
      That would set us free
      Our Lord
