I heard you're gonna leave me 
I've known it for a while 
I wasn't naive to the news 
My mind just couldn't walk a mile 
I only see you with me 
Cause I know the things you like 
I know all that you believe 
And all the plans of your life 
So take a minute to understand me 
To reevaluate your mind 
I'm everything you need 
And in this world a good man is hard to find 
And I know you'll miss me 
When all is said and done 
You'll think about this day 
And then you'll realize I was the one 

[Chorus:]
You know that all you need is in me and 
You know that my love's all right and 
Baby you know I can't be denied girl 
You know, ooh you know, you know 

Gave you all a man could give ya, 
Made sure I found the time, to 
Keep it all together, but the way you're 
Treating me ain't right can't understand it 
Why you're doing me the way you're 
Doing, do you enjoy to see our love 
Fade away 
Can't face the world without ya 
Can't even sleep at night 
Gave you all that I treasured 
And I tried to love you with all my might 
And I know you'll miss me when all is said and done 
You'll think about this day 
And then you'll realize I was the one 
You know 

[Chorus]
