[B II M:]
Sorry I never told you 
All I wanted to say 
And now it's too late to hold you 
'Cause you've flown away 
So far away 
Ayyy 

[MC:]
Never had I imagined 
Living without your smile 
Feeling and knowing you hear me 
It keeps me alive 
Alive 

[all:]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
[MC: Together]
One sweet day 
[MC:]
Evetually I'll see you in heaven... 

[B II M:]
Darling, I never showed you I never showed you 
Assumed you'd always be there I thought you'd always be there 
I took your presence for granted 
But I always cared 
[MC:] But I always cared 
And I miss the love we shared 

[all:]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
[MC: Together]
One sweet day 
[MC:] Evnetually I'll see you in heaven 

[B II M:]
Although the sun will never shine the same 
I'll always look to a brighter day 
[MC:] 
Yeah 
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep 
You will always listen as I pray 

[all:] 
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
[MC:] Together
One sweet day 

[all:]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
[MC:] Together
One sweet day 

[MC:] Sorry I never told you oooh 
[all:] All I wanted to say
