There was a time when I thought life was over and out 
When you went away from me 
My dying heart made it hard to breathe 
Would sit in my room 
Because I didn't want to have to go out 
And see you walking by 
One look and I'd break right down and cry 
Now you say that you've made a big mistake 
Never meant to take your love away 
But you can save your tired apologies 
'Cause it may seem hard to believe 
But 

[Chorus: ]
I'm doin' just fine 
Getting along very well 
Without you in my life 
I don't need you in my life 
I'm doin' just fine 
Time made me stronger 
You're no longer on my mind 

You were my earth 
My number one priority 
I gave me love to only you 
Anything you'd ask of me 
I would do 
But somewhere down the road 
You felt a change in the weather 
And told me that you had to journey on 
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone 
Now you say you never meant to play your games 
Girl, don't you know it's far too late 
Because you let our love just fall apart 
You no longer have a heart 

[Chorus ]

When you said goodbye 
I felt so all alone 
There were times at night I couldn't sleep 
My heart was much to weak to make it on my own 
Baby after all the misery 
And pain you put me through 
So unfair to me girl 
You're no longer my world 
And I ain't missin' you at all 

[Chorus ]
