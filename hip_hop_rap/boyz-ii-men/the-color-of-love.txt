[Nate]
I was lonely,
I needed someone, to see me threw,
I was at the, end of my rope,
I needed someone, to cut me lose
Then an angel, out of the blue,
Gave me the since that I, might make it through
And somehow I survived, with no rhyme or reason,
And now I know I'll make It, 
Through the miracle of you

[Chorus]
I know the Color Of Love,
And It lives in side of you
I know the color of truth,
Its in the image of you
If it comes for the heart, then you know that its true,
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
Like a rainbow
And the color of love, is in you

[Shawn]
Like a bridge,
Over troubled, troubled water
You stood beside me, stood beside me 
And your love, did not falter
And then the angel, angel in you,
Gave me the strength to know,
That I will get through,
And that's how I survived, ain't no other reason
And now I know I'll make it, through the miracle of you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Wanya]
So girl I want to thank you,
I can't thank you enough,
For showing me the meaning,
The meaning of true love,
When I was lost and so in need you opened up your heart
When I needed you to comfort me you opened up you arms
I couldn't face another day you said don't be afraid
You showed my heart the, showed me the way

[Chorus]

[Wanya]
Ohh, the color of you
