[Chorus:] 
Are you down, say you're wit it 
Let it go, I know you're feeling me 
Don't try to fight it 
I'm gonna help you find the way 
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon 

Baby, can't you see that he's 
No good 
Honey, he don't treat you like he should 
Baby I know just what to do to make it right 
Let me lead you to the best love 
That you ever had in your life 

So baby when you feel the need 
Don't you hesitate to reach right out and call me 
I'll supply your everything 
Make it so good for you 
That you'll end up falling in love with me 

[Chorus ]

Sister, you're the finest thing I know 
He gotta be crazy 
To think of ever letting you go 
I know you want me to ease the pain you feel 
I got a plan girl 
Just take my hand and follow me 

To a place where you can be 
All the things you couldn't be 
When you were with him 
I got all the qualities 
That a man would need 
To make you end up falling in love with me 

Girl, I know you wanna be with me 
So baby c'mon 
Girl you know that I can 
Set you free 
So baby c'mon 
I'll supply your every need
