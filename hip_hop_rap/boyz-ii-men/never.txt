In this world today 
Love is scarce and far away 
And your heart gets so afraid 
To trust someone 
All the times he let you down 
There was no love to be found 
Well it's not the end 
There'll be time to mend 
And you'll love again 

[Chorus:] 
Never, never let a broken heart 
Take a chance for love away 
Don't ever let it make you fall apart 
Never, never ever let the pain 
Take your need for love away 
Never, no never 

And I know it seems hard 
Open up, let down your guards 
But you owe it to your heart 
To try again 
Oh, comes the time 
When we must change 
With the past 
Don't take the blame 
Don't be ashamed 
Throw your fears away 

[Chorus ]

I know, don't be afraid 
For you will never find 
Another one you love again 
I know that you'll be sorry girl 
Be strong before it's too late 
Because forever is too long 
For you to live in pain 
Just don't give up 
Please open up to love 

[Chorus ]
