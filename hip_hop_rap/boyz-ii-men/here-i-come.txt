Look at us, just the way God intended us to be
Look up at the mirror to see you on top of me
What we're doin right now has been done before
Still it feels so new, don't you agree

Never want this to end baby
But it's hard to keep it all in, baby
Keep this key inside your box
Till it's time to open up for me
Let me set you free

I've been pheenin for you all night
And I know that thing gonna be right
Said it's gonna be right...here I go

[Chorus]
Oh my goodness here it comes I'm on my way
Baby all I got will fill you up
And make it okay
The expression on my face
Let you know it's bound to take place
Pull me close so
You can feel me as you wrap your legs around me and never let go...oh no

Tell me why, is that a tear I see in your eye
Baby are you cryin' cause it's over
Or cause it feels so good inside

I feel you trembling and I know it's not because your cold
Cause you know you deserve this and much more
You've been pheenin' for this all night
And you knew this thing's gonna be right

[Chorus]

Let me feel the rain on my finger tips
Let me kiss your back and around your hips
Don't let go, Mommy keep your grip
Forever

[Chorus]

[Adlib]
