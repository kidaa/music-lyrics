[Talk:]
Just take a minute and catch the vibe 
Just take a minute and catch the vibe 
Just take a minute and catch the vibe 
Just take a minute and catch the vibe

[Verse:]
Coolin' in the studio you know how the story goes 
Bobbin' our heads to the tune we're about to do 
It's a laid back swing thang 
The groove we feel is strong, 
We need peace here to get it on 
Having fun as we go, makin' sure the flavor shows 
Cause we're feeling alright 
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball, ya'll 
Everything's fine it ain't nothing to it cause 
We're gonna do it all, what are 

[Chorus:]
We're just vibin' dancing the night away 
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day 

In the basement music just right 
Nothing goin' down but the mellow sounds 
Of Mr. DJ's turntable's goin' round 
A mad sensation, a crew of women around sparks inspiration 
To set something off the right way to hear the people say 
That we're feelin' alright 
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball ya'll 
Everything's fine it ain't nothing to it 
'Cause we're gonna do it all, don't you know that 

We're just vibin' dancing the night away 
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day
