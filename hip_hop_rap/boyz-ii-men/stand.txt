I'll stand even when life has got me down 
      And my hopes and dreams are no where to be found 
      Still I stand cause I know 
      I'm too close to give up now 
      I put it all in your hands and just stand 
      yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

      Stand, even when nights seem cold, and 
      Stand, when you can't feel your soul, and 
      Stand, when your dark past won't seem to go away, help me say, you can 
      Stand, God is right by your side, and 
      He will make everything all right so, if you can lift your hands let's plan and just stand 

      If I cry, it's all right, cause it may be just what I need 
      Cause everybody hurts sometimes, and every heart needs relief 
      Still I know where to go, to the one who understands 
      So no matter what tomorrow may bring, still I stand 

      Stand, even when nights seem cold, and 
      Stand, when you can't feel your soul, and 
      Stand, when your dark past won't seem to go away, help me say, you can 
      Stand, God is right by your side, and 
      He will make everything all right so, if you can lift your hands let's plan and just stand 

      Everybody help me say... 
      Even if you fall still know that you can just stand, you can just stand... 
      If you can, lift your hands, let's plan, if you just stand 

      If you 
      Stand, even when nights seem cold, and 
      Stand, when you can't feel your soul, and 
      Stand, when your dark past won't seem to go away, help me say, you can 
      Stand, God is right by your side, and 
      He will make everything all right so, if you can lift your hands let's plan and just stand 

      If you stand... 
      Help me... 
      Lord, I know... 

      If you can, let's plan, stand
