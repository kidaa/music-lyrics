[Verse 1]
The first thing I did wrong
Was hook up with a girl who wasn't grown
She looked like a woman but her mind worked like a child
It was her girlish qualities that made me smile 
The outside never showed me what was in
And her ending didn't look like it began
Now I know and it's for sure
That you can't change a girl into a woman

[Hook]
I'm okay, make sure you're okay
No matter how long it takes
Make sure that you're okay
And if she goes away
Make sure that you're okay
Now that I got out
I'm just looking out trying to show you the way
To be okay

[Verse 2]
Now I hate to see you make the same mistakes
So avoid the things that cause your heart to break
From a hurting brother, I ain't trying to hate
But if you mess around with her she'll seal your fate
You'll never see it coming till it's there
And you'll find out that she doesn't really care
And it's real what I feel
You can have her ass I don't want her over here

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you decide to stay it's alright it's your decision
But take heed to what I say you'll be alright listen to what I'm saying
If you decide to go then go now you better leave her
Don't look back because she'll only bring you down
Oh, bring you down
Bring you down bring you down

[Breakdown]
Sing it one time
Okay, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Make sure you'll be okay
It's okay, okay

[Hook]
