London, Paris, Monte Carlo, Germany and Rome 
Different places, different faces still it feels like home 
China, Holland, Belgium, Rio, Africa, Japan 
That's the life we live and we do the best we can 
Here we go on another tour on the road again 
Feelin' good it's alright 
Just enjoying ourselves 
Come and take a flight with 

Boyz II Men back around the world 
And were comin' through your town 
All we do is for you 
'Cause you've always been there 
And we appreciate you 

Keisha, Kelly, Tonya, Stacy, Mica and LaShaun 
Kathy, Trina, Carla, Lisa, Cheri, and Diane 
All these girls around the world are fly in every land 
And it's hard to choose, but there's one for every man 

Boyz II Men back around the world 
And were comin' through your town 
All we do is for you 
'Cause you've always been there 
And we appreciate you 

Houston, Phoenix, Carolina, Jersey, and the Keys 
Denver, Boston, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee 
Dallas, Cleveland, Cali, Philly, New York, and DC 
That's the life we live and we do the best we can 
Here we go on another tour back in stride again 
Feelin' good it's alright 
Just enjoying ourselves 
Come and take a ride with 

Boyz II Men back around the world 
And were comin' through your town 
All we do is for you 
'Cause you've always been there 
And we appreciate you
