1st Verse:
On a perfect day
I know I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me can you weather the storm
'Cause I need somebody
Who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there
Chorus:
Sunny days
Everybody loves them
Tell me
Can you stand the rain?
Storms will come
This we know for sure
Can you stand the rain?
2nd verse:
Love unconditional
I'm not asking this of you
We've got to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done
Cause I need somebody
Who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there
Chorus
Can you stand the rain Repeat 4X's
No pressure
No pressure
From me baby
Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you
Will you be there for me?
Can you stand the rain Repeat 6X's
