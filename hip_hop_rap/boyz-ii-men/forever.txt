Forever in my heart
In my life you'll always be a part
The waves will crash, the wind will blow but forever in my heart, you will never know the blue skies will turn gray
But they'll always be a brighter day

[Chorus:]
Forever
Forever in my heart
In my life you'll always be a part
The sun will rise
The sun will set
In my heart, never forget
Forever

The whispers of the wind
Can you hear it?
The fragrance of the flowers
Can you smell it?
The beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
When I think of you, I see forever,
Don't hold back, I'll leave you never.
Forever in my heart you'll stay,
I'll be by your side, all my life, every day. Forever
