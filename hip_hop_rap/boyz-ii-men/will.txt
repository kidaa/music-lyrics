[Nate Morris]
Do you remember when?
We would gaze upon
The heavens up above
Revealed within the night
Took turns in looking thru
A telescope discovering
A little star that smiled right back at us

I never strayed away far form all the crowds
A hint of solitude
Concealed behind your smile
Remember when the lights went out that summer's eve
We stumbled in the dark and kissed beneath the stars

Wonder if it's possible to ever know
How many dreams I've cherished since that time ago
People only dream, when they close their eyes at night
But ill open up my eyes:

Wonder if it's possible to ever know
All the skies I've journeyed thru and touched before
Some rely on fate
But it's not the only way
This is my destiny
And this is my will

[Shawn Stockman]
The sparkle in the night
Glitter in the sky
Each star we see at night
Have all been here before
There really has to be
Some place nobody has seen
And there we'll start anew
Future for mw and you

Memories illuminate in harmony
Like a constellation bound in unity
Tho they used to sing
So scatter thru the sky
I recognize the beauty

Memories in circle all around me
Illustrate passage thru this journey
Confirming my belief, this is no coincidence
This is my destiny
This is my, will

[Wanya Morris]
Horizons I have crossed in the past
Chapters in the story of my life
All the midnight skies
Are promising forever more
I'm reaching out to soar

I wonder if it's possible to ever know
How many dreams I've cherished since that time ago
See people they only dream
When they close their eyes at night
But ill open up my eyes

I wonder if it's possible to ever know
All the skies I've journeyed thru and touched before
So rely on fate, but it's not the only way
This is my destiny, this is my will
