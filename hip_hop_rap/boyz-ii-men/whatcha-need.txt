Girl I see you crying
Tears rolling down your face
You're sick of him lying
Need someone to take his place

I can give you whatcha ask for
I can give you whatcha need
I'm down with anything you're down for
Baby you can count on me

Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
You'll never have to be sad
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad

You say that you're lonely
Need someone to hold you tight
You're faithful to him only
But he never treat you right, no
I'll be there when you call me
I'll be right there by your side
And whenever you're crying
I'll be there tonight oh I

Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
You'll never have to be sad baby
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad

And girl you need to know that
Only a fool would let you leave
Cause all the things you need are right here with me

Friendship, friendship, trust, trust, commitment

Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
You'll never have to be sad baby
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad

The one thing that matters is your happiness,
and I wanna be the one that makes you happy.
Let me be the one, I'll give you whatcha need
