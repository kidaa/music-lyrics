Bounce 
All, all I wanna do is see your body move 
I know you want it too 
So what you gotta do 
Can you smell the bass 
Taste a little snare 
The look upon your faces shows me that you're going there 
Steppin' at your best 
Clubbin' all night long 
The sweat rolls down your chest 
As you dance to the song 

You want it, you need it 
You can have it 
So come on, go ahead 

Bounce, Shake, Move, Swing 

Oh girl why you doin' that 
While I'm behind your back 
You're gonna make me flip 
And then I don't know how I'm gonna act 

Chorus: 
Bounce, all night long 
Shake, 'til the break of dawn 
Move, move that thang 
Swing, see you swang 
Bounce, up and down 
Shake, to the ground 
Move, oh so close 
Swing,don't you know 

You want it, you need it 
You can have it 
So come on, come on 

Bridge: 
If you want it, come and get it 
You can have it baby if you need it 
Won't you shake it like you want it baby 
Can I have it 
Can I get it baby 
You make me want it 
Cause I see it when you bounce it baby
