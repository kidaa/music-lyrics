Loving you I'm never gonna change my mind
Loving you I'm never gonna make you cry, cry
I'll be by your side now and forever more
Whole life with joy and delight

Don't you know I loved you from the start
From the moment that we met
Long before I saw that smile of yours
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart
You're the only one that I've been searching for
There was a time when I had lost my way
Couldn't find the lights around me
I was almost frozen in the dark
You came along to give me life again
You warmed and opened up my broken heart

I'm never gonna change my mind
I'm loving you, I'm never gonna make you cry
Don't you know that I'll be by your side
Now and forever more
To fill your heart with joy and delight

Sometimes I made you feel all alone
When I'm too caught up in myself
Maybe I put you down in sorrow
But still you keep on knocking on my door
And I know that you make me feel so strong

It's time for me to make you understand
My heart wants to be with you
I'll be everything you want me to
So baby, won't you give me another chance
So I can show you everything I can do

I'm never gonna change my mind
I'm never gonna make you cry
Girl I'll be by your side now and forever more
Fill your whole life with joy and delight

Everytime we gotta make it through the rain
Everytime the things all turn out in vain
I swear I'll be by your side now and forever more
To protect you from any kind of pain

Someone told me
And I agree that we were born in this world
To find one single, one single truth, girl it's you
So stay right beside me
You know it's the way that we should be
I don't wanna think about
What it'd be if we were to fall apart

Oh, I'm loving you
And I'm never gonna change my mind
And I'm never gonna make you cry
Said I'll be by your side forever more
Fill your heart with joy and delight

Every every time gotta make it through
Things all turn out in vain
And I swear I'll be by your side forever more
To protect you from any kind of pain

Don't you know I loved you from the start
From the moment that we met
Long before I saw that smile of yours
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart
You're the only one that I've been searching for

You're the very one that I've been searching for
What I've been searching for a million years is you
