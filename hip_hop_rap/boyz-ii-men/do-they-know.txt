Do they know 
That Jesus was born on this day to save our lives 
Do they know 
That he carried the sins of the world upon his heart 
So that you and I could live 
And we'd have an alternative 
In this life 

Do they know what this day means 
Do they know where we've been and how it should be 
Tell me do they know 
Do they know we should love one another 
Do they know 
The world will be alright only if they know 

Do they know 
That sharing love to each other is how we all should live 
Do they know 
That the reason for giving is more than what you give 
And to you and your's this day 
On a very special holiday 
Give your love 

Chorus 

And Lord if they know 
Keep them in your care 
Keep them inside your heart 
And help them spread the word 

Chorus repeats to fade
