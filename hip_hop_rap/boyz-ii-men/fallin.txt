The woman all my life been waiting
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than love you endlessly
Don't know what you see in me
Girl you bring out the best in me
And I realize when I look in your eyes
There's nothing that I can do
Chorus:
Catch me I'm fallin'
Head over heels in love with you
Oh bless me fallin'
And no one can do
Catch me I'm fallin'
And my heart is like brand new
I'm falling in love, falling in love
With you
Everytime I see your face
Its like sunshine on a cloudy day
Its a feeling that can't be replaced
Like the feeling when we embrace
Out of everything that you do to me
For your love I'll do almost everything
And I realize when I look in your eyes
There's nothing that I cannot do
Chorus
Now tell me how much you love me
And show me how much you need
I'm waiting right here for you
Whenever you need
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' in love with you
repeat till fade out
