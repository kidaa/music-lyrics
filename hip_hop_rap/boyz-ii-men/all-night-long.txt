[Chorus: ]
You say the things you feel are right 
But I feel those things are wrong 
And for that we fight all night long 
If you knew all the things I knew 
Walked a mile inside my shoes 
It could make our love flow all night long 

There you go trippin' on the things I say 
Cause things aren't going your way 
Friends say I should leave but love forces me to stay 
I try, try to give you all of my time 
Still I feel denied 
And when we fuss and fight I keep askin' myself why 

Every single day I pray that we can make things right 
Cause when it seems we're going somewhere 
Problems seem to arise 
What must we do to make each other see 
This relationship should be 
All about me for you 
And you for me 

[Chorus ]

What's the deal Do you ever feel the things I feel 
I try to keep our lovin' for real 
Even when it seems we don't see eye to eye 
You know I never wanna see you go 
Cause you're the best I've ever known 
So tell me just how long it's gonna take to be 

Happy every day and every night just like we should 
Cause to be happy with you all me life I know I could 
What must I do, do to make you trust in me 
Is that a possibility 
Don't you know that it hurts me when we disagree 

[Chorus ]

Baby today, we'll put the past behind 
Let's not waste no time 
We can do it oooh all night 
I like it when you do the things you do to me 
All night 

[Chorus]
