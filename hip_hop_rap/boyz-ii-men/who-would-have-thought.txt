I fell in love 
On a very special day 
This feeling will never go away 
Now I can say 
That with your love, I'll always stay 
Look at me and tell me if I'm being deceived 
Cause right now this feelin' is hard to believe 
Chorus: 
Who would have thought it'd be this way? 
Oh, no 
I never thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day 
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day? 
I can't believe 
That you are right here with me 
The star on my Christmas tree 
I wanna love you endlessly 
And that's the way I always want it to be want it to be 
Standing there when the lights from the tree 
Meets your eyes 
I can see 
That I only want you 
'Cuz you're all that I need 
Chorus 
I'd never fall in love on Christmas day 
I never thought I'd fall in love 
On Christmas, Christmas day I'd fall in love 
Chorus 
I know that Christ came down 
To endure my sins and shame 
But now my dear we fall in love 
On this very special day 
This day 
do do do do do do do do do do do hey 
Thought it'd be this way 
Oh, no 
I never thought I'd fall in love 
I never thought I'd fall in love 
Who would have thought I'd fall in love on Christmas day? 
ad-lib & fade out
