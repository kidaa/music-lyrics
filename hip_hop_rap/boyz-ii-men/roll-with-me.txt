I don't wanna waste your time, 
      Listen kinda play in-line, 
      But I need to know somethings about you, 
      One.. Do you have a man you claim, 
      Are you doing your own thing, 
      Cause if so then I can't leave without your name and your number, 
      Where you live, 
      Can I call you sometime 
      Wait a minute, 
      But yet again I'll give you mine. 
      Tell me bout your inter-self, 
      Who you'll be with, 
      Your right demand, 
      Can I read, 
      Let me know, 
      For you don't, 
      I just won't take no 

      [Chorus] x2 
      Baby I wanna do, 
      Whatever's on your mind, 
      You'll make it all come true, 
      If you roll wit' me tonight 

      You,
      Make a brother wanna do, 
      Things I never thought I'd do 
      Got me open and I'm hopin', 
      Baby I can take you for a ride 
      Bently's right outside 
      We can make it happin' 
      If you just tell me your name and your number, 
      Where you live, can I call you sometime 
      Wait a minute, matter of fact I'll give you my number 
      If you tell bout your inter-self, who you'll be with 
      Your right demand, can I read it 
      Let me know, for you don't, I just won't take no... 

      [Chorus] x2 
      Baby I wanna do, 
      Whatever's on your mind, 
      You'll make it all come true, 
      If you roll wit' me tonight 

      Ohh. I don't wanna stress you, all I wanna do is get next to you 
      Ohh. I wanna be the man that makes you feel like no one else can 
      Ohh. I don't wanna stress you, all I wanna do is get next to you, 
      Want you to give it all to me, I wanna be the one that sets you free

      Cause I just won't take no.. 

      [Chorus] x3
