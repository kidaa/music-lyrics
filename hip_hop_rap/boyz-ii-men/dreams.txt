Here I am again, wondering if you're okay
Can't stop this troubled heart
Cuz we're apart, miles away
Phone pressed up to my ear
Wish you were here, holding me
A face to go with your sweet voice 
Will bring me joy, totally

I know I can't be there
But baby it's alright
I'll be waiting for you, tonight
I pray that you'll be there
When I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams, tonight

One thing that never changes
No matter what
I can't wait to see you
Can't wait to feel you
And there's a place of our own, where we can go
Nobody knows
I close my eyes real tight
And make love to you all night

I know I can't be there
Baby it's alright
I'll be waiting for you, tonight
I pray that you'll be there
When I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams, tonight

I wish I may, I wish you might
Find some time when you sleep tonight
To think of me and I'll appear before your eyes
It's my paradise, your world
You are my heart, my life, my girl
Oh, can't wait to go to sleep
Cuz there's a possibility, you'll meet me

Ohh, oh oh oh oh
Ohh yeah, oh yeah
I know...

I know I can't be there
Baby it's alright
I'll be waiting for you, tonight
I pray that you'll be there
When I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams, tonight

I know I can't be there
Baby it's alright
I'll be waiting for you, tonight
I pray that you'll be there
When I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams, tonight
