If I ever had the chance
To be the king of this whole land
I wouldn't do it if you couldn't be beside me
On your love you have me strung
You are the breath of life in my lungs
And I thank you for the love that you've shown me
Before I go to sleep I pray
And thank the lord for another day with you
You're my dream come true

[Chorus:]
I can love you the way
That you want me to
My love, the things I do
Are for you

Girl you're all I ever need
And you're mine exclusively
When we're all alone I wish the time
Remains the same
From the time the sun appears
'Till the moon's reflection is clear
I think about your love
And hope that it stays near
I'll take you all around this earth
To show you just how much you're worth
To me, you're my destiny

[Chorus [twice]]

[Bridge:]
You're all the reason that I live
And all the love that I have I'll give
To you, you're my dream come true
And I promise

[Chorus ]
