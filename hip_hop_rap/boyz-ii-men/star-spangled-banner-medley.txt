Oh say can you see
      By the dawn's early light
      Was so proudly we hailed
      At the twilight's last gleaming


      Whose broad stripes and bright stars
      Through the perilous light
      For the ramparts we watched
      Were so gallantly streaming


      My country 'tis of thee
      Sweet land of liberty
      Of thee I sing
      Land where my father's died
      Land of the pilgrim's pride
      From every mountainside
      Let freedom ring


      And the rocket's red glare
      The bombs bursting in air
      Gave proof through the night That out flag was still there


      Oh say does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave
      O'er the land of the free
      And the home of the brave
