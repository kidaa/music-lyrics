*Mike and Wanya talk in the beginning:* 
Mike: Hey, what's wrong squirt? 
Wanya: I don't know man. Sometimes around this time of year I just get depressed. 
Mike: Man, this isn't the time of year to be depressed. It's the time to be happy and 
giving, man. 
Wanya: You know, sometimes I think about things that are happening in the world today, 
things I didn't have. I just feel like crying. 
Mike: We all feel that way sometimes. But, it'll be alright. 
Wanya: I just, I just wonder why. 

Every day at this time of year 
I wonder time and time again 
Why are kids suffering? 
All of the tears 'cause being caught in the crossfire Why? 
Somebody tell me why 
As the joyous day comes along 
The eldest feel there's something wrong 
He's looking for Mom but she's not there 
Kids are looking for reindeer in the air 

Chorus: 
She messed up again 
Why? 
My brother and my sister 
They ain't got no toys 
What am I supposed to do 
When growing up for me wasn't joy? 
It's gonna be a why Christmas 
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a 
A why Christmas 

No one was there but Grandma and her friends 
A time of heartache is setting in 
There's nothing I can do 
Just sit and feel pain run me through 
I often wished they were never born 
The thought of them not having no toys 
Their little hearts were torn 
I was young and I cried as well 
I didn't have a job 
But I prayed to the Lord that there'd be better days 
Yes, he gave me a reason to live 
He gave me a sign 
But I still think to that day when 

Chorus 

Brother and my 
Brother and my 
Brother and my 
Sister 
repeats a lot 

Chorus repeats to fade out
