Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town
They do, this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah
Merry Christmas Baby

This Christmas

This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very Special Christmas for me, yeah

It's a very Special Christmas

Be happy that you have a family to love

Me kissing you underneath that mistletoe

Let me hear you sing

Merry Christmas, very Special Christmas to you
Hope it's filled with cheer and a Happy New Year
Merry Christmas, Happy Christmas to you
Let me hear you sing it again, yeah
