[Intro] 
Yeah, NFL, Boyz II Men 
Characters baby 
Meet me on the dance floor, come on 

[Nafis] 
Yo 
It's like this, in a nice miss we faked it some tight whips 
Chromed out *edited* out tokens'll right this 
That frozen alley had my lip on some mad *edited* 
Cuz we stack chips, had us grove to a plat' list 
When they see us, yeah run 
They hopin' out the Beamers, Pourches Range Rovers and Hummers 
My crew the cleanest, we the grittiest, back the meanest chick 
Get the Nafis dip, bouncers at the door clear the path 
It's Nafis forever clique 

[Boys II Men] 
Have them take a place 
People sittin' 'round 
Riders on the side 
No one's even tried to get down 
Brotha's being fly 
Ladies acting shy 
Ain't no doubt to loose 
I'm gon' get my groove on tonight 
Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance 

[1] - Ain't no use in holding up the wall 
Come and get that body on the floor 
Baby, lose control and scream and shout 
Get your boogie down and work it out 

Everybody's out, party's going on 
And we're gonna rock until the sunlight crash and dawn 
'Till the break of dawn 
Ain't a thing that you can do 
When the rhythm's calling you 
Let it work it's way right into you 
Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance 

[Repeat 1 ]
[Repeat 1 ]

Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 

[Garrison Hearst] 
Make it move there's no need to hold back now 
Hit the floor, let loose and watch me break this down 
Keep it mellow or we can get wild 
See you haters in the corner tryin' to peep my style 
You want my stash, gold, checks, sports illustrated 
I'm motivated by the fact that I'm being hated 
Now my pockets swell, game straight outta ATL 
G-land, Boyz II Men, work it out 
What's the deal 

[Repeat 1]
