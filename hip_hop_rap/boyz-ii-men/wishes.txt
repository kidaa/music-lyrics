Here I am on my own 
It gets hard sometimes when I'm traveling this empty world 
All alone I get tired 
And oh I get oh so weak 
And I need for someone to come and rescue me 

To help me along to catch when I miss 
To show me where I oughta be 
So I can be strong and face all of this 

That my life tries to discourage me with. 
With a little luck will I find you 
And if I do it is you who'll make my dreams come true 
Just a little bit of happiness 
Is all that I wish 

And I hope that you can grant me this 
When I look at my life 
And where I've been 
And I wonder if the story has a happy end, 

Like they always do, but if my wish comes true 
I just hope and pray I always can depend on you 
To help me along to catch when I miss 
To show me where I oughta be 
So I can be strong and face all of this 

That my life tries to discourage me with. 
With a little luck will I find you 
And if I do it is you who'll make my dreams come true 
Just a little bit of happiness 

Is all that I wish 
And I hope that you can grant me this [Repeat]
