...you are my everything...

i've been thinking of a way to phrase it
seem to never find the words to say it
but it's true to say 
i've been occupied by other things i've been occupied by other things
how could i think that you wouldn't notice you wouldn't notice
the absence of our closeness
realizing now 
i will never let it happen again again

now i realize
that you are my everything
and without you here beside me
it's like an angel without it's wings
and now i realize i realize
that you are my everything
now i know it
should've shown it
and now i realize that you are my everything

as i sit here contemplating
'bout our love that's slowly fading
so insensitive
didn't hear you calling out for me...didn't hear you calling out my name..
if i could change the past i would do
everything to show i appreciate you
open up your heart
let me help you fall in love again
my friend, 'cause now i

now i realize
that you are my everything
and without you here beside me
it's like an angel without it's wings
now i and now i realize
that you are my everything
now i know it
should've shown it
and now i realize 
that you are my everything

now i realize 
that you are my everything
and without you here beside me
it's like an angel without it's wings like an angel without it's wings
and now and now i realize
that you are my everything you are everything
now i know it now i know it
shouldve shown it should've shown it
and now i realize that you are my everything

now i realize 
that you are my everything
life without you here beside me and like an angel without it's wings
oh can't you see that i apologize
and now i realize that you are my everything
now i know it
should've shown it your the air that i breathe
and now i realize the spirit that lives in my soul
that you are my everything
