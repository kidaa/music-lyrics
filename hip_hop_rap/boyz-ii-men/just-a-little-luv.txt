This world can be
Full of undying hate
There's no sympathy
It's so hard to find someone
Who truly cares out there

As I look around
I see so many problems
And no answers found
Material things cannot make the emptiness fade
It will stay
We don't have to go far to find the happiness we need
Listen to our hearts
And they'll say

[Chorus:]
Just a little luv will get you through
Just a little luv that's all
Just a little luv is all you need
To get by

We emphasize to much on personal care
Never realize
The one and only thing that makes out blessing flow, flow
If you want to help
Find the truth into
Just look deep inside yourself
Cause it's there

[Chorus ]

We don't have to go far
To find the happiness we need
Listen to our hearts
And they'll say

[Chorus [twice]]
