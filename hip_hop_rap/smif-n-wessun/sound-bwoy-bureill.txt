Verse One:

Boom bye bye/in a botty bwoy head/

2 shots dead to him chin/enemy a friend/

Now who da rude bwoy/wan come tess dogg/
I find his family/and I.D. em in da morgue/
I bet you never thought I bust led/
To prize/I'm a fortified blunt head just like a dread/

You cant tess the champion sound/You gettin bucked down/
recognize the boot camp click/in a de Bucktown/
Gun thirsty little bastard/always blasted/
from the sess of chocolate/from my dick gastin/
You say you number one wicked selecta/
I say you punani/and I wetcha/
Keep the bull/before I pull this here trigga/
cause you don't wanna tess me/when I'm tipsy off the liquor/
Like a punk they call McGirt/got his feelings hurt/
showed his true colors/had to yank up his skirt/
now he's in misery/tryin to cop a plea/
led to his head/from gun clapper number 3/
see/lick off a shot you no dick rida/
lick a shot punani/not gun fire/

Now everybody wanna be dongongon/
all around New York niggas be talkin/but we be stalkin/
in the docks when the gun starts buckin/
but in the day/be wary of where you be walkin/
