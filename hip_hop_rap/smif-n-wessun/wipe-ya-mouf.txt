[Steele]
Walkin down the street, watchin you, clockin me
Could it be because I'm magnetic, yet it gives me a fuckin headache
Cuz it's pathetic when niggas jump on ya dick and sweat it
But it gets hectic, when I set it off, by sick jazz niggas pop stressin
Smif-N-Wessun, from the corner of my red eyes, I peeped you
But you don't know, cuz I rock my rag real low, move slow
Cuz you might get moved on, can't even get my crews on
Without niggas puttin they screws on, shit ain't cool son
Cuz soon one day I feel I'm gonna have to lay somebody for real
A deal is, but Steele is strictly business
So when dick riders slide around, I dismiss shit
And get wit, Boot Camp Clik, how we flip shit
On the regular, forever stay on our own dick

[Chorus: Tek]
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you twist up ganja
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you big money spender
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you no follower
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for Jah Rastafari

[Tek]
I'm pullin you're coats to the side of the block, we've all been to
See them on the corner when you're lookin out ya window
The dick riders, on Dick Riders Boulevard
You'se that large, and even got to look hard
You got a couple probably at the crib as we speak
In ninety now, ain't no woman town for the weak
Don't laugh though, stress'll make a nigga hurt somethin
Precede to get some yard weed cuz the dred is pumpin
And as I approach and greetin by my cuz Roach
";What up, ya high ass nigga, yo, you're shits the dope!";
And then he just K.I.M., Keep It Moving, damn
And now here comes the dick riders screamin ";You da man";
Until I turn my back, bet to quick to grab the gat
The head dick rider said ";I know where he live at";
See that's what I'm talkin, suckin dick while you're walkin
Now you'se the target of the Boot Camp stalk kids

[Chorus: Tek]
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you no cop blocker
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you do ganja hot seller
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for number 1 mama
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for the rebel winner

[Steele]
Aiyo Haktu what up son? You know money over there? nah
The one who wan stare over here like I'm tried scared
Me, or maybe check what I wear, see I represent lovely
For my Timb tree to my D-I-C-K, every day, all day, we stay read up
If you ride dicks, then shut up, keep it movin, cuz
I'm fed up

[Tek]
You took the words right out my mouth, ST
Got niggas ridin we, tryinna suck on these trees
Pockets full of lent, hummers browner than shit
Wanna suck and duck, cuz he's the neighborhood dick
Rider, if I was a bag of smoke, would I be chocolate?
It's Smif-N-Wessun, keep our dick out ya mouth kid
