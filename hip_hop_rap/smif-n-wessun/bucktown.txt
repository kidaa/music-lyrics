SteeleI walk around town with my pound strapped down to my side
No frontin', just in case I gotta smoke some
Around here headz don't act their age
Ya might be another dead boy on the front page
Enter the cipher... withcha lighter
El's are ready, prepare to run another all nighter
But keep watch for the cops cuz they rock glocks
Comin' on the block tryin' to rock knots
Pigs be actin' like they bigga than us niggaz from da streets
cuz we stalk mad deep when they walk beats
I guess they hold a grudge cuz I won't budge
Playin' tough, starin' down da judge with my hand's cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear, awww yeah
Now I'm up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it cuz I'm brown or is it niggaz I'm from Bucktown?

Got five MC's that wanna come test we
Got ya noses hangin' ovea da trees
Bring on your sounds kid, drown by my massive
Kill your body boy and take your lover for hostage
Knock knock, maybe not the fourshots empty
On the violator that was sent out to get me
I'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
But still I'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothin' sweet Jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to by dick above
Don't sweat the buldge comin' from my hip
Grip what ya did hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark
Heltah Skeltah smirks while you're gettin' torn apart
Here come the Rude Boys with the ganja plants
Smif-N-Wesson and I roll with the Boot Camp

Another murderer, just another prankster
Rude Boy dead 'cause he thought he was a gangsta
Tried ta live da life of a hood from the streets
Test da wrong dread, now I'm in eternal sleep
Mr. Ripper I lurk in da Stuy
Twist da ganja 'cause I want ta get high
with my Breaddren, a boodah session
learn ya lesson
or get blasted by Mr. Smif or Mr. Wessun

Bucktown's everywhere I swear
It's clear to me
You feel the weed, now I really see 
Night falls around the way
Originoo heads come out to play
Puff herb, break day
It's just a regular, everyday state of being I
Mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
I find reality follows me where I roam
360 degrees back home in...
