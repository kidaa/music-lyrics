Verse 1:  
[Aaliyah]   Playa  
Boy, I've been watching you  
Like the hawk in the sky that fly  
Boy you are my prey my prey  
Boy, I promise you  
If we keep bumpin' heads  
I know that one of these days days  
We gon' hook it up  
Probably talk on the phone  
But see, I don't know if that's good  
I've been holding back this secret from you  
I probably shouldn't tell ya but  
If I...  

Chorus: 
If I let you know...  
1 - You cans tell nobody  
    Il talking about nobody  
    Are you responsible  
    Boy I gotta watch my back  
    Cause I'm not just anybody  

2 - Is it my go, is it your go  
    Sometimes I'm goody-goody  
    Right now I'm naughty-naughty  
    Say yes or say no  
    Cause I really need somebody  
    Tell me are you that somebody  

Verse 2:  
[Aaliyah]   Playa  
Boy, won't you pick me up  
At the park right now, up the block  
While everyone sleeps sleeps, sleeps  
I'll be waiting there  
With my trench, my locs, my hat  
Just so I'm low key  
If you tell the world  
don't speak, you know that would be weak  
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you  
With my heart, my soul  
I probably shouldn't let ya know  
But If I...  

Chorus: 
If I let this go...
