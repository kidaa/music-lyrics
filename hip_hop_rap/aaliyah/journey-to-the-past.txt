Heart don't fail me now
courage don't desert me 
don't turn back now that we're here
people always say life is full of chooses 
no one ever mentions fear

or how the world can seem so long
or how the world can seem so vast
courage see me through 
heart i'm trusting you
on this journey... to the past

somewhere down this road 
i know someone's waiting 
years of dreams just can't be wrong 
arms will open wide 
i'll be safe and wanted finally home where i belong 

well starting here my life begins 
starting now im learning fast
courge see me through
heart I'm trusting you 
on this journey... to the past

Heart don't fail me now oh no
courage don't desert me desert me
Home, love, family there was once a time 
i must have had them too
Home, love, family I will never be complete until I find you

One step at a time
one hope, then another 
who knows where this road may go ooh
back to who I was 
On to find my future 
Things my heart still needs to know

yes let this be a sign
let this road be mine 
let it lead me to my past
courage see me through 
heart I'm trusting you to bring me home 
courage see me through heart im trusting u
