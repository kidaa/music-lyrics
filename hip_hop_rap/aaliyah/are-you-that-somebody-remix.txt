Boy, I been watching you like a hawk in the sky at night
Cause you are my prey my prey
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin heads
I know that one of these days days
We gon hook it up while we talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I been holding back this secret from you I probably shouldn't tell it but 

[CHORUS]
If I, if I let you knowYou can't tell nobody
I'm talking bout nobody
Are you responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me YOUR that somebody

[Verse 2:]
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone sleeps sleeps, sleeps
I'll be waiting there with my tucks, my loads, my hat 
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world don't sleep, you know that we'll be weak
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let ya but if I

[CHORUS 2]
If I, if I let this go
