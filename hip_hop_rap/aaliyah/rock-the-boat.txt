Boy You Know You Make Me Float 
Boy You Really Get Me High 
I Feel Like I'm On Dope 
Cause You
You Serve Me On A Regular
Boy We Need To Tie This Rope 
Before We Drift Any Deeper
There Now Hold Me Close 
Boy Let's Take This Overboard Now

Stroke It For Me, Stroke It For Me 

verse 2:
Ooooh Baby I Love Your Stroke 
Cause You, Cause You Get Me To Where I'm Going 
In A Jury You'll Get My Vote 
Cause I Believe, I Believe You Know Just What You Doing Now 
Baby Now We Can Coast 
Just Don't Get In A Hurry 
That's Too Slow 
Go Ahead And Put That Thing In Over Drive
