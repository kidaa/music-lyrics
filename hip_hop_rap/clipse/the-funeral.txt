[Malice]
Whether they gag me bound me hollow point round me I feel ya
Dump me off the side of a bridge and drown me uh huh
Spare my family the details on how they found me yes
Vigil by candle light and gather round me farewell
And talk about how I would lounge with fly women
How I was flossing in clubs in fine linen preach on
Hopping in them ill whips with chrome spinning
Malice was true to the game for 9 innings ha ha ha
We love sinning but now I answer for that
Apologize to my fam I got you all dressing in black I hear ya
A long line family and friends they signing in
My niece singing solo organs and violins yea
Wife in her black veil hands flooded with diamonds ha ha ha
Remaining calm under each arms my children
Daddys in a better place entering golden doors talk to me
With ivory all white pillars and marble floors yow
Brand new physical frame with no flaws
On my throne thats guarded by angels with 4-4's yea
Terror retaliate show em how real it be
A split second 'fore you blazed they probably thought you was me preach on
Returning on some Crow shit let em know shit
They mess with the wrong click quick to blow shit yea
Yall know who owned this so they end my career
But still I put my tag on this earth Malice was here I feel ya

[Chorus 2x's]
Take a walk on my side
No more tears no more fears no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here tell me whos gonna ride
ride with me ride with me ride {overlapped by last line}

[Terror]
Hold me high Gucci suit and tie yea
Let my casket reach the sky tell my girl dont cry I fell ya
Just sing me a lullabye and let the white doves fly uh huh
Cuz I heard from a bird its only sleep when you die thats wrong
Break me in unison outside right thru the lens
My mother cried cuz she knew that I was only true to sin yow
Celebrate my passing with gun shots and systems blasting uh huh
Blown up posters of Terror held by children laughing preach on
No matter how foul my burial open casket
Now simply so they can see my clusters and my diamonds smiling hello
Im sorry I failed only cuz the ones I left were so real uh huh
For me my doggs will lie, die, shoot, cry, or kill feel me
First to Malice sorry that I left you half in a hole
But now you'll write for both of us ill channel thoughts thru your soul uh huh
Emmanuelle remember this when you see my nemesis
Drop my picture on his chest and make his family reminisce yow
Revenge so sweet and I crush you with the heat uh huh
Your the first one I call when its time to put em to sleep I love you
Now fo real grand dragon horns stabbing the skys uh huh
Turn Mag' em laser tag em couldnt sever all ties yea
My final request on the day im layed to rest
Take my body to the ocean and have a water front ves' feel me
This will be my burial this eulogy will be in stereo
Blue Angels will draw my face during an aerial ahh

[Chorus 4x's]
