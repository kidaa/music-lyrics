[Pharrell]   Pusha T in sing-song voice
Yo...
I go by the name... I'm yo' pusha 
of Pharrell from the Neptunes...
And I just wanna let y'all know... I'm yo' pusha
The world is about to feel...
Something... I'm yo' pusha, that they've never felt before
C'mon

Pusha T
From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard
I'm the...neighborhood pusha
Call me subwoofer, 'cause I pump "base" like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cuz
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the fetti govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

[Chorus: Pharrell]
......Grindin'! Ahhh
......Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
...Hu-huuh...

Malice overlapping last line of Chorus
Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
And disguised in this rap so the feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got hoes for a dozen
Even eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all nevermind me

[Chorus]
......Grindin'! Ahhh
......Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
...Hu-huuh...

[Hook: The Clipse in sing-song voice and Pharrell]
Grin-din', when you know what I keep in a lining Whooof...
Niggas better stay in line, when Whooof...
When you see a nigga like me shinin' Grin-ding!
Grin-din', when you know what I keep in a lining Whooof...
Niggas better stay in line, when Whooof...
When you see a nigga like me shinin' Grin-ding!

Malice
My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't "Abel/able", there was always "Cain/caine"
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm Grinding
Pusha T overlapping Malice's last line
I move 'caine like a criple
Balance weight through the hood
Kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel--
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in... whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen, the other, noddin' and dozin'
I'm grindin' Jack

[Chorus]
...Grindin'! Ahhh
...Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
Grindin'! Ahhh
...Hu-huuh...

[Hook: The Clipse in sing-song voice and Pharrell]
Grin-din', when you know what I keep in a lining
Niggas better stay in line, when
When you see a nigga like me shinin' Grin-ding!
Grin-din', when you know what I keep in a lining
Niggas better stay in line, when
When you see a nigga like me shinin' Grin-ding!
