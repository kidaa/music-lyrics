[Chorus]
I changed my life so I can be with you
But you turned and walked away,
Tell me what to do.
I changed my life so I can be with you
But you turned and walked away
Tell me what to do
Somehow I know you still believe
Somehow I know you still believe

[Verse 1]
You interrupted my bliss
Fuck this I sorry
Used to be steak fish calamari
But now all you do is drink and party
Girl you ain't the greatest the greatest was Ali
In the words of the late great Bob Marley
No Woman, no cry, yes suh I do believe.
I count my blessing every time I see my loved ones.
Wondering why I be stressing of a silly woman.
Boy get your head straight, boy get your head right.
Keep on buzzin with your cousin
Boy have a good time.
Sometime I know it's right, sometimes I know it's wrong
Sometimes I do it big, sometimes I'm all alone.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Up and down like a see-saw.
Baby let me free fall.
Me fall for that again
Don't make me hee haw.
Never will I get caught up again.
I'm gonna put that on my momma and my next of kin
They say money can't buy me happiness,
But it will brighten my day.
They say money can't buy me happiness,
But it will brighten my day.
Baby girl you don did it.
Girl I ain't wit it.
Only problem in my life was you,
So good ridden.
I'm out the door quick, feet first sideways.
I'm checking out baby,
And breathin some highway.
[Chorus]

Money won't buy you happiness
But it will brighten your day.
Money won't buy you happiness,
But it will brighten your day.
