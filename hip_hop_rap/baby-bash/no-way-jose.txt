Say I ain't got time

[Akon]
Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
Said ain't got time Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
Man ain't got time Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
Pass me by Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
'Cuz I gotta' be on my way On my way
Ain't got time to play Time to play
I can't go broke another day Broke another day
No way Jose No way Jose 'Cuz I ain't got no time

[Bash]
My lifestyle so cold, holla' for the gold
Some say I'm too drunk, some say I'm too blowed
And rollin' wit' kilos and stackin' them C-Notes
Watchin' my cheese grow and blowin' on trees dawg
And I really can't help it I'm a gifted at timin' gorilla grindin' no time for groupies or freestylin'
Want it green as a gecko I'm respectful to some of ya'll
But some of ya'll be frontin' I don't owe shit to none of ya'll
I got bills to comprehend, popo's be poppin' in
Waitin' and watchin' when, they can take my block in
Comin' in in all the traffic supplyin' they bad habits
The game is gettin' graphic but man I got to have it
Some love a drug addict
But it ain't no excuse
I got these money mackin' skills I'mma put 'em to use
And I ain't doin' too much, ya'll just ain't doin' enough
And I refuse to let a so-called ruin my stuff

[Akon]
Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
Said ain't got time Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
Man ain't got time Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
Pass me by Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by
'Cuz I gotta' be on my way On my way
Ain't got time to play Time to play
I can't go broke another day Broke another day
No way Jose No way Jose 'Cuz I ain't got no time

[Bash]
I'm movin', and got nothin' to say
'Cuz 24 hours ain't enough time in a day
So time doesn't exist and I'm watchin' my wrist
If a peck on the cheek mean death watch for the kiss
Take time under pressure
By any means or measure
Remember one's trash is another man's treasure
Buisness befo' pleasure I'm disciplined and I'm focused
Why you rap cats battle to see who dopest
I'm in the trenches face down in the game bruh
And can't nobody know my real name bruh
Livin' in the season they killin' fo' no reason
And if I make it past 30 then I'm over achievin'
Believin' in the truth, believin' in the way
The light that I follow might bring me a brighter day
In the truth, in the way
The light that I follow might bring me a brighter day

[Akon]
Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by

Ain't got time to play Time to play
