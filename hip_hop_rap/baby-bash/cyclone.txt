Oh oh oh its fud a dud a nine

[Chorus:]
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

I look at that double on the back a that bumper
She aint even playin when shes shakin that rumpa
And for who you dont know 
She gett lower than them other
Even wit her girl friends
Shes show stoppin wit a hustla
The way she move her body
She might see the masaratti
She tryin a put it on me
Tryin to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy
Always tight and never sloppy
And got an onturage
And her own papparazzi
Now ther she go again
Ridin through the stormy whether
You better button up if you wantta gonna get
Cause it is what it is
And everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it boy you better run for cover

[Chorus:]
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

she comes around
When she  breaks them boys of a typoon
it comes around
Better get that fatyy like a boss typoon
it comes around
Now hold it steady cause she make a mysoon
comes around
Now you can google down below the i-tunes
She what im sayin
She aint playin
And she got them heads turnin
You gonna her it clack-clack
When them heals get to burnin
clack-clack
Its a little so flake off
She got her on leggwa
And got us all doin right now

[Chorus:]
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

Shortie got looks 
And shortie got class
Shortie got hips
And shortie got a##
Plus she hit the stage
She drop it down low like
rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew
Ahh this is crazy

She must be the way to the ladies
She be lookin like

[Chorus:]
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone 
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn us by night song
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone
