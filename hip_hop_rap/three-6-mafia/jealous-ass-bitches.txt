[ScareCrow]
Well I be damned

We choppin off ones on these fuckin ass bitches cuz
they ain't got shit else to offer, Baraka
I'm only 5"5" so I love when they call me Lil' Poppa
I can't get a post, the copper so close
Less evil down here by tha dock cuz they think they some coners
But in a lil while you fuck niggas gone need some blood doners
We ridin through India launcher
Put dirt in they launcher
They dead on the corner we comin real loca
I tell ya the nigs in my click man we comin real loca
They stayin real blow on tha snow
Always Coca Cola... but not the kind in the can
The kind in the drank cooler or in the drink stand
These niggas got faith in they strap like a crucifix
Run on there knees like the purist christian
And niggas in mafia land do not give a damn matter you penny or brands
We dont have to been that great cuz its no smoking the
store Kalicofalilo check yo collar

[Chorus 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

Draped up and dripped out
