"Say ahh, not a thermometer, bitch, 
it's the nine inches" -- [Kingpin Skinny Pimp]

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

Ass and titties, ass and titties
Ass and titties, and big booty bitches

[DJ Paul]
You dealing with a thug thats quick to kick the diamond Roly Rolex
Don't pay attention to these boyfriends cause I leave em holy
Them boys fake maggets I done put they girl up in my rover
Put the black quote em quote em face and took her to Cardova
Jacuzzi bubbily drinking bubbily hoes they can't believe
My TV built up in the wall like they don't want to leave
There doing there best tryng to impress they sticking out there chest
Paul go some booty  and nothing less

[Juicy J]
A nigga got to get his dick sucked got to get his dick sucked
Riding down the strip in the Lexus truck poppin hush
Pearly rolex on my wrist haters bout to have a fit
Dip frpm the curb I hit a case of Mo I'm bout to sip
Lit to the hydo green blinging on them twenty thangs
Heavy niggaz dropping weight while Juicy J be running trains
Whats the business strictly pimping all them freaks I know they miss me
When they throw a players ball tell em that your boy gon win it

[Chorus 4X]

[La Chat]

[Chorus 4X]

Lil momma got big tatta up in the club
She been shaking and shaking it up she showed me love
Big butt  sock it baby
Wanna be my lady girl please you must be crazy
This ain't the eightys I'm a sucka for your black fit
Split skirt holla holla for that dolla dolla
For what it's worth I'm a step to this fine fucker
I think I love her I'm a touch her with that ratitatat motherfucker
Hug in public know you love it got me coming when you rub it
Damn my stomach I can feel it going duh duh duh
Look here honey I can't play no games lights go down when a freak ashamed
Hit me up star 69 and then maybe will have sexual ways
But I pray that this night of lust won't  lead to a girl that I can't trust
Shit young nigga post up in the club want  to go strut your funky stuff
But I do love the ladys cause they stay looking pretty
While they shaking breaking it and taking it 
baby baby shake your ass and titties

[Chorus 4X]
