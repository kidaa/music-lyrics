[Verse 1]
Now lawdy lawdy lawdy lawdy please Lord have some mercy mercy
This girl is throwin Judy Judy I think she 'bout to hurt me hurt me
See she went front to back back then she went side to side side
I'm throwing blanky jankies jankies I think I need a ride ride
One pocket full of pills pills and a little bag of that cola cola
The other one full of weed weed and a semi auto pistol-a tol-a
See I ain't no dancin dude dude but I can lean like a cholo cholo
See ma you go with me cause I can't beat not goin home solo solo
Ya dig?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They call me the Juice when I'm at strip club
I put down a hundred or a du-uh-uh-uhhhb
It don't matter to a player I'm a stu-uh-uh-uhhhd
Cause when I leave the club I'ma fu-uh-uh-uhhhck
You can ride with the mayne if he givin up the brain
Little scared to ride wit'cha I don't even know your name
There's a whole lotta room in the front of the Range
Like Barack Obama said yeah it's time for a change
Pull over on the roll on the back seat back seat
Pop that body now you got me got me
You a fine chick kinda classy classy
Said her name was Ten now I'm grabbin grabbin
Cuz she got grip on the whip
With her big round booty with the silicone tits
Shit she bouncin on my lap and she tryin to own six
I whispered in her ear "Yeah It's Hard For a Pimp"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All my ladies with a body, put yo' hands in the URR
Youse a good lookin hottie, put yo' hands in the URR
Project Pat, lookin for a model, poppin that booty, I'ma pop bottles
Your girl's a cutie, know she gargles, don't get me wrong, I keep them hollows
Shorty hot, watch her rock, let me see that lolli pop
Body rock, don't you stop, I love the way that booty drop
Sideways, front back, up and down I like that
Cherry lolli, chocolate lolli, I wanna see you pop that lolli

[Chorus]
