put 2 in the gun and flex so I won't be in that resting place 

[Lord Infamous]

I shall make fragments, daggerous dragon 
poison and lashes, 2000 hazardous 
can you imagine, me with the Magnum 
fire breathing dragon, blow away the ashes 
what the fuck happen, torture and trap them 
Satan is digging, Scarecrow premonition 
the world is ending, please make a decision  

[LaChat]

go get that bitch and throw her ass in my trunk 
that infrared net be getting her head 
she make more sounds and she dumped 
where the fuck the evidence bitch

LaChat ain't bout her business 
I tote my glock I keep it cocked 
the .38 slug for a nigga 
could be my brother husband cousin

ain't got no love in my soul 
don't fuck with me know who I be 
LaChat that murdering hoe

[T-Rock]
I got him running from my slugs wrath 
niggas get they mugs snapped 
licking shots from plastic glocks 
you marinate in blood baths 
ignorance leave my manner 
silently concealed with Anna 
hoe I pugulize your skull 
and split it with the snipers scanner 
insert the capping glock 
gunpoint faster props 
lock and load like master lock 
and hit you for an aftershock 
I'm a snake so meet your fate 
compensate the paper chase 
Triple 6 is running shit 
corroborate and we make you wait
