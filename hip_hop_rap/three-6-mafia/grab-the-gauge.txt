[Hook: 4x]

Grab my guage and then erase
Grab my guage and then erase
Ride up on the street
And put some niggas in the front page

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]

Naughty naughty motherfuckers get the feelin' ah this shit
This shit so funky comes way under nigga grounds are Triple 6
I'm smokin' out, I'm livin' large,
I keep you hatas out my face
Yo life is over motherfucka, when I grab ahold that guage
My niggas from the Three 6 click they keep me hooked up on that game
I'm chargin' niggas daily maybe, lady, is out to get paid
You hoes can't fuck wit me
I'm flowin', showin', hoes I ain't no hata
Comin' strictly from the South-side gettin' greater later
Everybody wanna ride for he say she say they say next
You suckas need to grow up out that kiddy shit
Quit fakin' just cause ah Three, Six, Mafia
Coming nine-six, to two G bitch
Misses lady gangsta on that weed, chicken rib shit
Just to let you know my partner hoe come on the scenery
Scenery, filled wid red dots, infra red beams

You can't hide your life is over kid,

Cause you have fucked up wid the wrong ass bitch

[Hook 4x]

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous & Koopsta]

Infamous is comin' strapped like an Italian Arabic
I reckon I wreckin' ya South American
Killa guerilla Colombian Muslim or some, loop
Maniac, comin' to rip your damn head of your neck
put your heart in the back and I spit on yo ashes
and straight to the head for the chief
and the blunt of the Indicut down in my stash,
I reside in the insane asylum the bodies I pound 'em
on Infamous Island where there is no smilin'
the niggas buckwild and the weapons are silenced
there's nothing combine us,
Military barbarian buck 'em and bury 'em fuck wid the
scarier, insanitarium, popper and carry 'em,
There's no merry love, only murder blood,
Till I take something worst out ah all ah these
hollow points burst and disperse going through
flesh and bone through the back of your shirt
you be burnt up and buried in dirt that'll work,
The Scarecrow be smokin' these niggas for shit
they can't get wid these bitches they'll never compare,
I'm comin' from the land of Triple 6 niggas still
sufferin' every day that I swear

[Koopsta Knicca]

I see them fucking pressin' on they brother man,
It happens everyday don't make me grab the guage,
Dangerously I play I best to kill wid guage
And put ya body in the back of that grey Chevrolet

[Hook 'til fade]
