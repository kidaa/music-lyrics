Always wanna flex they nuts

Stuck up they butt
Unload this whole damn clip up in your ass hoe
Naw, its to late to squash the shit

And the motherfuckin jumpin grass 
Searching a real nigga in his draws
Like they ass a fag
Get yo god damn hands of a real one
Just before I make you feel the bullets from my steal some 
Big ass cop think I'm playin 
But I'm from tha hood

Ready and prepared

When my nine crones at your dome

You gonna make me catch a charge nigga
Figga out a way

Slip, trip, cock back, quick
Then I shoot a bitch
Aint no damn fuckin around

Aim point blank 
At your face
Makin sure your dead
Headed to my motherfuckn ride
Dichin evidence

Headed to my residence

Rat tat tat tat
With the sound of the tech nine
Take this trick bitch ass nigga tryin to take mine
Oh naw man I aint gonna take yours 
Aint nothing like that dog you know what I'm sayin
Nine to yo fuckin dome bitch

[Chorus - Till fade]
