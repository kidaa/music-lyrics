[Juicy J]
It started out into a one lock down
me and paul in a hopeless cell
waitin to use the fuckin phone
waitin to get a fuckin bell
some people think 2 on 1 is just a place for cops and robbers
niggas still smokin weed constantly, passing dollars
mase in yo face when it's time to get buckwild
cuz lawyer fees are high as hell
payin these can't even help my trial
So while I'm thinkin to myself
a nigga walked right up to me
lookin me up and down wit a frown
smellin like a bottle of Crown
but I dont give a fuck
cuz this hoe gone make me make the news
for shankin niggas in the neck
whippin guns and takin shoes
he threw up a gang sign
I turned my back didnt pay em no mind
and when I looked around again
he threw it up another time
I said yo whats up fool
is there somethin that your trying to proove
I aint wit that gang shit
he smiled and fired up a Kool
walked a little closer to me
I'ma pull them dreds up outta his head
he didnt show no violent act
but in a low tone this is what he said

[Chorus]
Killa, Killa, whatcha gonna do
get blessed in the red, I get blessed in the blue
on the 34th floor they got them G's claimin true
So whatcha gonna do, young killa

[ScareCrow]
Ya gotta have somebody watchin somebody else
and them watchin somebody too
while you watchin everybody 
cuz they ass is out to get you
no matter if you 
in the dope game 
or the rap game
or what situation
you hear my friend
there is no such thing as a fuckin friend
mabey you got to get them secretly
they out to get you 
cant no love be in yo heart
by the way fuck these hoes too
you know they just as devious as ni-gga-ros
that ho don't love yo ass
and fool if you was broke she'd blow like smoke
And fuck these police ass niggas, snitches pull the sword
Stab you in ya back for a muthafuckin re-ward
junky muthafuckers sittin down at the precinct
Lookin at pictures trying to damnify a nigga
On the realla man, this game is so filthy
And everybody guilty, niggas talkin trilly
so keep next to clip see
man trust is somethin that I never had much faith in
cuz fuckin wit niggas you will end up in the state pen

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
