DJ Paul [Intro Repeat 2X] 
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta 
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta 
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta 
Gangsta, gangsta, weak niggaz perpetrate 
Gangsta, gangsta, weak niggaz perpetrate 

DJ Paul [Verse 1] 
I grab my swatter I swat this bug, he laid to rest 
Fuckin' wit T-R-I-P-L, E-S-I-X 
Niggaz be talkin' but in the end I like fuck 'em up 
In the beginnin' they could've survived but they had no nuts 
Bitch where you graduated from, I said a school of hoe-in' 
Cuz in yo face, off in the streets aint nothin' but hoe is showin' 
Too fuckin' light, too fuckin' light to try to fight 
Stick you with knives, shoot you with - nines and take yo life 

[Verse 2] Juicy J 
Yea we know you niggaz are fuckin' scared cuz we don't play around 
Never wanna step cuz Three 6 Mafia put you in the ground 
People say you buck but we all know that's just that liquor bro 
Niggaz swear you hype but all that hyper is from hittin' that snow 
If a member call me then I'm gonna pack my yawks and roll 
Ride down on yo block and close up shop and leave yo body cold 
Foo this ain't no game so tuck ya chain and coward hide yo grill 
High cappin' and dissin' in yo rappin' just might get ya killed 

Chorus 2X 
They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them 
Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb 
You got no ends, now you got no friends 
Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in 

[Verse 3] Project Pat 
Whachu doin' round hea? My nigga I gotta get ya 
Fresh outta jail-ie, my mind on bailin', so I split ya 
Head to the meet-ie, give to the needy so fuck the rest 
No understandin', Projects the greedy, ya could be next 
I'm robbin' victims with of the face of a ??? 
No hesitatin', I come out buckin' so watch the nine 
Off in East Memphis transactin' bizness I know you straight 
I'm buckin' you fakers who ain't got cheese, the ones I hate 

[Verse 4] Lord Infamous 
Could it be me, could it be somethin' in the fuckin' air 
Im seein' niggaz, them niggaz bodies flyin' everywhere 
You wanna know if the Lord is mackin' or a fuckin' player 
I'm keepin' all of you muthafuckas in my fuckin' prayers 
Everywhere that I go I'm gettin' all these evil stares 
I'm sick of all of these hatin' muthafuckas in my hair 
All in my bizness, God is my witness I don't even care 
Cause all you bitches you get the *blaah* died hell yeah 

Repeat Chorus 2X 

[Verse 5] Koopsta Knicca 
Deep deep in them trenches of Memphis where I'm seriously pimpin' 
Da Koopsta da Knicca breakin' mo bitches than London got bridges 
Send this to you niggas so you besta listen well 
Touch me and you'll die see you can burn wit me in hell 
This hi-zo gi-zo-zy iz-I for you niggas that've lost it 
Spl-izat yi-zo iz-ass, will ??? off it 
Call Chris mane, shit dump 'em in a ditch 
Witness this wicked bit whipped up outta the Six riders 

[Verse 6] Crunchy Blac 
My nigga CB he be back out here on these bricks again 
He kickin' in doors, he lookin' for him some dividends 
He kidnappin' hoes so he can make him some money mane 
And fuckin' wit him is like fuckin' wit somethin' different 
Ya gotta be tough, nigga ya gotta be rough 
Like ash to ash nigga, and dust to dust 
In gats we trust nigga, it really ain't much nigga 
Cuz talkin' to us nigga, we blowin' ya up 

Repeat Chorus 2X 

Til fade 
I'm smoked out, snorted out, drunken and I'm blown
