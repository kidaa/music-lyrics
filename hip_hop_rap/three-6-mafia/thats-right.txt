[Chorus] Akon:
Despite what you heard
Or what you saw
When you look at me man you see a hardcore
A real street hood nigga
Wish a nigga would nigga
I could give a damn what you thing about it all
If you think I'm crazy That's right
If you think I'm lazy That's right
Cuz It Don't really matter what you think about me
Nigga fuck you pay me That's right
DJ Paul
9 9 6, got my hands on my first mill'
Eyes on 7, damn man it a quarter bill
Enemies closer, but my 45's closer
You can be the starter
But I'm a be the closer
Damn it what these hatas say
Damn it what these hatas thought
I reside in matches , they know it aint my fault
Everyshit I do I do it just to make these suckas mad
And they rise, they claimin thay get all ready
Had ten dolla tees, but the cheese 15 hundred
Yo life time dreams and I'd already done it
Plus I'd done it wit yo wife
She said I made her night
But I didn't hit her back cuz her mouth wasn't right
Chorus
Despite what you heard
Or what you saw
When you look at me man you see a hardcore
A real street hood nigga
Wish a nigga would nigga
I could give a damn what you thing about it all
If you think I'm crazy That's right
If you think I'm lazy That's right
Cuz It Don't really matter what you think about me
Nigga fuck you pay me That's right
Juicy J
I'm a north Memphis playa I got my own thangy thang
I Pimp a rock shit wit a little blangy blang
I don't respect you hatas bitch you dolla shuga shane
You mad at me cuz I'm ballin and I got that candy cane
You niggaz sit and blow then you think you're superman
I hit you with this nine cock and back and make it rain
It's your boy Juicy J
And I'm wild out the frame
I teabag your girl and let my dog run and train
The more you hate
The more we sip
The streets we bomb
The extra clips
It aint no thang to have a fifth
Cuz real playas don't take no shit
Chorus
Despite what you heard
Or what you saw
When you look at me man you see a hardcore
A real street hood nigga
Wish a nigga would nigga
I could give a damn what you thing about it all
If you think I'm crazy That's right
If you think I'm lazy That's right
Cuz It Don't really matter what you think about me
Nigga Fuck you pay me That's right
