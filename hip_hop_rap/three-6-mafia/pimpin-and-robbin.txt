[Skinny Pimp:]

Pimps them sluts, break them hoes, ride clean, smoke your dope
dipped in gold, on the vogues, everything steady, I'm chargin hoes.
Bonin, conin, playas only, catch this game that I spit
Playa Hatin Niggaz we smoke, me pretty boy smile don't joke.
We scope my 44 under the crush, don't you bite the dust
Fuckin with us niggas, Leave your name on your block...up bitch
But I don't get into that gangsta shit, I relax like a pimp and mack
Hit them trizacks jumpin in comes me, fiends coming
The skinny nigga in the house, breakin bitches down
When I drive in the Bonneville, smokin on a match
We chokin, talkin, loc'in, talk crazy to my bitch
I'm walkin with a limp, with my cane, spittin that game, makin stangs
Give Me Some! "Mane, I'm fucked up playa" -- That's why you ridin clean
Frontin Niggaz Kills Me, fakin like they heavy
If you ain't makin stangs, sell me all your jewelry
I'm outtie, my shortie is clean with them hammer thangs
My nigga Rickie, dipped in gold, sho' nuff rollin that weed.

Pimpin is Robbin and Droppin these Suckaz Like Ducks...Bitch

Ain't No Money Comin Quicker Than That Ho Mane..

Give me somethin bitch, I'm talkin about dollar signs
Look here ho, I don't wanna fuck, but buck bitty buck
A shootin gangsta, light that ass up...
Let's play a game called pimpin', and robbin, mobbin'
Pimpin ain't never stoppin
Leanin to the curb, slam goes my car do'
Nothin behind my head but a bumpin system and a few of my hoes
Drop me off some chee$e, hit em with somethin to keep em pretty
Groupie, droopie, drawed a$$ bitches, don't act siddity
Find you a trick and break him down, and keep him no. 1 chewer
If my ends don't meet, bitch you get your a$$ beat.
Swisher Sweets, spliff, get a whiff of that endo blast
Rims gleamin on the pavement, catchin eyes when I pass
Downin some Hennessey, a friend of me is some money though
Romance with no finance is a nuisance, Fuck that honey ho
Droppin bombs, packin tones for playas to  killaz and macks
Skulls peelaz, rollin, hoe pullin...muthafucka, can you buy that
