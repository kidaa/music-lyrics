[DJ Paul]
My nigga silent night, deadly night
That's when I start when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man then I toss the dynamite
Bitches yall ain't got the guns
Bitches yall ain't got the funds
Fuckin' around with Three to Six I'll make you niggas duck and run
Hoes this ain't no game I'm playin'
I'm sayin', I'm fed up with you boys
Crunchy catch that trick back on that-ways he still remeber them punks
Straight hoe nigga, flat broke nigga
Make his eyes close I drop you niggas like I drop my hoes

[Gangsta Boo]

How you bumpin' our shit then you turn around an you diss
You wouldn't want to step we been in this shit you rookie bitch

[Juicy J]
Now I ain't fucked up bout these niggas dissin'
Cause a nigga givin these blessings
See you like a dog you fetching, starin at a fuckin' weapon
Know your momma taught you better, never try to diss a player
Maybe I can kill you now or stall around and kill you later
Probably I should call the boys
Tell them to bring them toys
We gonna bust them bitches and fold them up like aluminium foil
And keep loadin them guns
Takin em one by one
Throwin' up sets and snappin' necks until the job is done

[Lord Infamous]
Take em' on a lyrical holocaust
Infamous is just our mafia boss
Nigga walk around with his head blown off
Call me the wicked ass lord of farce
Nigga one look and get his ass ripped apart
Infamous coke has got no heart
Coming through the hoe ain't no motherfuckin boss
Fall to the earth 
Hoes be froze in a permanent dose
These bitches blow me outta their clothes
Call me the nigga with the dirty nose
That will unload a 44 up to the foes
Ain't no playin with you motherfuckin hoes
Let's throw that rope but you hoes don't know
But the infamous know you
So and So and Toe and Toe I take the flow

I'm staying crunk I'm plenty drunk I can't be barrin' you bitches
I'm staying crunk I'm plenty fucked I can't be barrin' you bitches

[Koopsta Knicca]

So hit in their the face like a third grader on acid
