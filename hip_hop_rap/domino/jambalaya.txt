The time has come to rid the earth of all its Christian filth
Exterminating all alive and accepting without guilt
Only through the spilling of blood can the world be cleansed
Rivers of red must run free for us to make amends

Purification day, has come, purification day

Judgments come, reaper's song, murder must now take place
Rejoice in death, final breath, dying God's children must face

Executions taking place for the good of mankind
Knowing that purity is what we plan to find
Showered in the blood of unworthy souls
Salvation by death, as Satan takes his role

Purification day, has come, purification day

Judgments come, reaper's song, murder must now take place
Rejoice in death, final breath, dying God's children must face
