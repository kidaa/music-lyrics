Please just tell me what the hell is wrong
Do you wanna eat,
Do you wanna sleep,
Do you wanna shout?
Just settle down,
Settle down,
Settle down

Well I give you candy,
Give you diamonds,
Give you pills,
I'll give you
Anything you want,
Hundred dollar bills.

Cause you married me,

Hundred dollar bills
And I even let you watch the shows you want to see,
cause you married me,

Hundred dollar bills
And I
