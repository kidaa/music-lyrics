sleep never comes quick enough to protect us
there is no shelter in the present from the ghosts of the past
like well-driven nails
memories dig their claws in our backs
revealing our black hearts
unable to forgive ourselves
our parched mouths pray for rain
and only the clouds bear witness as we wither away
