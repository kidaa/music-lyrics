I've been wanting you again
And there's no mistake
Like a candle in the wind
I've been blown away

Emotion in Motion, Emotion in Motion,
Emotion in Motion, Driving me again.

I don't sleep much anymore
People don't seem real
Either up, or on the floor
What is this I feel?

Emotion in Motion, Emotion in Motion,
Emotion in Motion, Driving me again.

It's getting so hard to understand
What is this feeling?
It's getting so hard to understand
Understand, Emotion in Motion,

Emotion in Motion, Emotion in Motion,
Emotion in Motion, Emotion in Motion,
Driving me again.
