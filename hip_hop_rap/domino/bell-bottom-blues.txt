Don't treat me like a woman

Don't treat me like a man

Don't treat me like you know me

Just treat me for who I am

Oh, don't treat me like a woman

Don't treat me like a man

Don't treat me like you know me

Just treat me for who and what I am

Don't treat me like a woman

Don't treat me like a man

Don't treat me like you know me

There's so much more

There's so much more

I'm so much more

I'm so much more than that
