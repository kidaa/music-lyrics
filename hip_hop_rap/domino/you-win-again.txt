And give you all of me, all of me

Swimming deep inside your loving girl

La mas linda in the world
I hope you want to be a Barrio Girl
Por favor, senorita, please
Da me el sabor de la amorarita
You look fresh to me
It's like destiny
And i need a little T-A-S-T-E
I put my arms around you
And then i wrap it tight
I need a taste of love
I got the appetite
