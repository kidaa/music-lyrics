Dont wanna live the normal life
Got contraband in my eyes
Alcohol and cigarettes,
Good white drugs i aint done yet
I like to fuck
I like to fight
Starting shit just feels right
In the end we all just die
So along the way why not get high?

Chorus:
Contraband, god I love you
Contraband, I need you so
Contraband, I wanna hold ya
Contraband, lets fuckin' go
Contraband, gonna take you to the show

Some may say ive lost my mind
Out of control but i feel fine
As long as theres still drugs to do
Beers to drink
Girls to screw
Smokin' crack
With transients
In a park somehow makes sense
See ya in rehab, you stupid fuck
That' all for now so lets go get drunk
