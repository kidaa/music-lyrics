Blacktop pavement cover me
Like a chemical reaction or a steam roller
Spreading randomly
There's a distan buzz and a low frequency
It tickles my ear, it rumbles under my feet
And it shakes the leaves off of every tree
Violently
What pretension!  Everlasting peace
Everything must cease
Institution on the Hill
Like a beacon in the mind of an ancestor
To ignite a people's will
There's a shadowed stain on the west facade
It has spread like decay to enshroud the fraud
And the descentants find it oh so odd
Oh so odd
What pretension!  Everlasting peace
Everything must cease
Grave memorial hewn white stone
Like the comforting caress of a mother
Or a friend you've always known
It evokes such pain and significance
What was once is reduced to remembrance
And the generations pass without recompense
What pretension! Everlasting peace.  Everything must cease.
