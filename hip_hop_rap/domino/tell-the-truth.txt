Look at your life, look at the way you slip and slide.
Look at your time
Look at the ones that you've left behind.
Look at your eyes, the haunted black circles of your plight.
But you can get by, oh and killing you might take one more night.
Cause you're a famous monster, you do whatever they offer.

You tie their noose around your neck and they throw you over.

Look at your mind, look at the strength you never found.
You lean on your pride, the only friend that would never let you down.
Look at the signs, look at the way they stop and stare.
they're watching you die, and when you're gone it's like you weren't even there.

Cause you're a famous monster, you do whatever they offer.
You tie their noose around your neck and they throw you over.X3
