I haven't seen you lately
But you keep me wondering where you are
Lately I remember the way you were
When all I need is someone who gives
Someone who's there to love me always
Baby please, you're all I need
You no longer cannot hide how I feel inside
So I'm saying to you
You're all I need and I got to have you here with me
I want you baby yeah
I used to think that maybe you'd see all the things I sacrificed
But lately you've been running out of my life
when all I need is someone who gives
Someone who's there to love me always
Baby please you're all I need
And it hasn't been the same since you want and gone away
I'm singing
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're All I need
Don't you know that sometimes I cry
'Cause you don't know how much you mean to me
This time I hope you realize you're all I need
Yeah Yeah Yeah
You're all I need, I don't wanna let you go
