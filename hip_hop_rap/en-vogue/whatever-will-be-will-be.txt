got a letter just the other day 
so much was left unsaid 
when you went away 
how my heart grew so cold 
from the misery of dreams ago 
an open envelope 
the last time that we spoke 
you said that you would always be my man 
and now this letter's here 
what will you say my dear 
to bring me to emotions once again 
the truth of it you say 
there's never been day 
that you're not sorry you apologize 
but life teaches new things 
beyond the pain it brings 
you to a place where you are truly wise 
que sera sera 
what will be will be 
i'm happy for you and me 
that we can finally see what was meant 
que sera sera 
what will be will be 
i'm happy for you and me 
that we can finally see what was meant 
i know we've made mistakes 
cause love is give and take 
i mean to say it wasn't all your fault 
i too had some regrets 
such pain i've felted yet 
it's better to have love than not at all 
the memories we had of all the good and bad 
has helped me be the woman that i am 
so don't apologize 
i've come to realize 
just what is meant by all in love is fair 
que sera sera 
what will be will be 
i'm happy for you and me 
that we can finally see what was meant 
que sera sera 
what will be will be 
i'm happy for you and me 
that we can finally see what was meant 
sometimes it's just not meant to be 
but the love that we share goes on and on 
spiritually there'll be no more crying 
no and there'll be no more lying no no no no no 
and the truth that we gained will offset the pain 
and now we finally see 
que sera sera 
what will be will be 
i'm happy for you and me 
that we can finally see what was meant 
que sera sera 
what will be will be 
i'm happy for you and me 
that we can finally see what was meant 
hmm hmm hey ooh yeah oh 
ooh
