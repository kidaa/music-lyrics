this is for the ones
that like to party till dawn
and the beat won't stop
till the last one drops
and the people won't stay
if the dj don't play
this if for the ones
who like to really have fun
and the bad girls do
what the bad boys want to
and the good girls don't
and the good guys really want to
but they're scared
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
thumpin' bumpin' 
this is for the old
and the new school too
from the beat box sands
to the hip hop waste land
from the house of blues
to the jazzy and the cool
this is for the world
or wherever you are
on the sun or moon
or in between those two
you are never too far 
to connect with all of us
from which you stand
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
thumpin' bumpin' 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
and it beats on time 
this is for the year
and the years to come
so let's celebrate
and let us elevate our fellow mankind
it's purposive love through others 
human waste
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
thumpin' bumpin' 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
and it beats on time 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
thumpin' bumpin' 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know but it's no place of mine
and that place i'll never be be 
what's the world without a beat of love 
i don't know cause my heart's beating fine
and it beats on time
