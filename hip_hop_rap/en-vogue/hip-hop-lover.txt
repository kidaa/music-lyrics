Hip hop, do it 'til you drop  
Don't stop - don't you ever stop  

This is it and you know  
I'm comin' free style  
To the club to see En Vogue  
I'll run a country mile  
Dope hat combat boots I'm comin'  
Cutie pies  
Yo I know En Vogue will love me  
'Cause I'm too fly  
I'll do my jerkin' dance make 'em  
Stare yo give a laugh  
Ask to dance they look me over  
And say oh no we'll pass  
But that's ok I'll just dance  
And do my own thang  
But when the night is over  
They'll remember Wayne Wayne  

chorus  

Me and my girlfriends broke down to the club  
The minute we stepped in  
We were being asked to the dance floor  
Before I got his name  
He was hittin' on me strong  
But I knew from the conversation  
He was a little bit too young  

chorus  
Brown leather combat sales tag on his hat  
He wore his clothes inside-out yo mental tip - oh  
He had a funky step and I thought he was so cute  
But as far as hooking up with him  
He had to come harder than that, yeah  

chorus  

When the set was over  
We headed out to the car  
He politely asked to walk me out  
He's playng good so far  
The minute I blinked my eyes  
He snuck in a little kiss  
So I swung out quick to smack him one  
But I'm glad I missed  

chorus  

The beat may drop but not like all the others  

chorus  
    chorus:  

Hip hop do it 'til you drop  
Don't stop don't you ever stop  
Do it to me baby  
Hip hop do it 'til you drop  
Don't stop don't you ever stop
