I'm crazy, I got crazay love for you
It must be fate
I never would've met you if I wasn't late
Oh, my mistake for hitting your new car
Something 'bout you took me in, something 'bout that dark brown skin
Something 'bout that sexy smile, something 'bout you drove me wild
And now I'm crazy, They're gonna put me away
Chorus
As I can't believe this world without the sun
I can't believe my heart without your love
Those who don't understand, I haven't had anyone to win my heart
Like you've done to me thus far
[Kamil's Rap]
Chorus
I'm in love with you
And the love is true 
No one else will do
I got crazay love for you
Repeat
