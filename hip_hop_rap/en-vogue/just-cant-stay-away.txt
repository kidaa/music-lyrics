Won't you come close to me now
Won't you come close to me now
Here I am baby
Right back in your arms
What is it 'bout your love
That draws me to you
And though this is not the first time, baby
I ever wanted to get away, no
Oh but the magic of your love
Just would not let me stray
So I find that I just can't
Stay away from you baby, you yea
You see, I just can't stay away from you
Let me tell ya
I've been through a lot of changes
see, my mama scorn me
Oh yes she did
And my closest friends, oh Lord
You know they warned me
They said you're no good for me
But I just ignored it
Yes I did
Cause I didn't have time
No time, no time, no time
To sit around and decide what to do
When someone controls your mind
There's not much you can do
So you see that's why
I can't stay away
I don't wanna, from you
It's not in my power to leave you
You control the soul in me
I can't stay away
You've been so good to me
I just love that man
Just can't, don't want to, I can't no way
