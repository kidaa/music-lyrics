sometimes i feel a bit insane 
i will confess i deserve nothing less than 
what you've given me so far

my life's so bright like summer skies 
i dreamed so long to have someone like you 
and now you're here with me 
and it feels so good

it must be love if i feel this way 
i love you more than there are voices in the wind 
only love makes me do these things 
i love you so i can't let go 
now that i have you 
i love you so i want the whole wide world to know 
i always thought you were my soulmate 
and extension of my heart 
the angels say it's a spiritual thing 
we will never be apart 
that's why i'm high when i am by your side 
my life's so bright like summer skies 
i dreamed so long to have someone like you babe 
and now you're here with me 
and it feels so good ooh
