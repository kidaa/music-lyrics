Standing on this dusty road
Listening to my radio
If you could see me, I know you'd swear
I'm a thousand miles from anywhere
Well it may seem stong insane to you, baby
But I guess it's just what I gotta do
Just to get myself to where you are
Don't you know I traveled many times as far
Well I hope I'm headed in the right direction
Got no time for making wrong decisions
What could give me such a sense of mission
Only love..... could've brought me here
In the right direction
Well it takes a strong and a mighty wind
To send me all the places I've been
It takes more than one who tells a tale, baby
Searching for some holy grail
And I... hope I'm headed in the right direction
Got no time for making wrong decisions
What could give me such a sense of mission
Only love..... could've brought me here
Everybody knows that love will make you crazy
Make you play the fool it's so intoxicating
So don't you be surprised if one lazy afternoon
I come knocking on your door baby
Cause you know I'm hot on you
Well I may not pass this way again
And if I do, I don't know when
But it seems to me, unless I'm wrong, baby
Our paths will cross before too long
Well I hope I'm headed in the right direction
Got no time for making wrong decisions
What could give me such a sense of mission
Only love..... should've brought me here
repeat 2x
Only love can set me off in the right direction
repeat until fade
