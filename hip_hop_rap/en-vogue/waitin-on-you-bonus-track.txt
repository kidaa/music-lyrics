It's ten o' clock and I'm still alone, waitin'
by the phone, it makes me think you won't
be back again, and I'm feeling so intense.
backs: Got me waitin', got me waitin'.
chorus
I can't keep wastin' my time, waitin' on you
to come home, to come home now.
repeat
I fantasize of makin' love, it's such a lonely
feeling without you, but I would not have
to dream, if you would just be there to
share my love desire.
bridge
I should not be alone, just waitin' for a
man who says he loves me so. I have more
patience than I can believe. It's a shame, I
can't believe I'm still alone
