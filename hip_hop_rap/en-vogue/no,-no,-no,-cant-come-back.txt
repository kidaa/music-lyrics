last night woke in bed 
in a cold cold sweat so sweaty so funky 
dreamin' of bad things to be or not to be 
haunting things like homelessness all the lonely people 
without a job car or food to eat 
leaves you a little bit paranoid well well 
can you spare a dime 
but it reminds me how easily 
we let our fears affect who we are 
no no no can't come back 
no bad feelings no no no 
no sad feelings no no no 
no jealous feelings no no no 
no insecure feelings 
no no no can't come back 
no ill feelings no no no 
no jealous feelings no no no 
no ego trippin' no no no 
no insecure feelings 
no no no can't come back 
had a friend in desperate need 
of a little attention compassion you see 
did i mention that friend was me nope 
who'd just broken up from a love affair well well well well 
i must admit i was truly hurt 
and i couldn't change the facts and that's a fact 
he loves her more than he loves me 
and it's truly just as simple as that 
no no no can't come back 
no bad feelings no no no 
no sad feelings no no no 
no jealous feelings no no no 
no insecure feelings 
no no no can't come back 
no ill feelings no no no 
no jealous feelings no no no 
no ego trippin' no no no 
no insecure feelings 
no no no can't come back 
don't care what other people say 
don't listen to them anyway 
can't let the evil get it's way 
don't let bad feelings make you pay 
don't care what other people say
