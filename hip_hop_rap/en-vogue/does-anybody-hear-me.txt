Chorus:
Does Anybody hear me? 
Is anybody listening to what's going on?
Before we move on. 
Does Anybody Hear me? 
Is anybody listening?
How can we change hate?
before it's too late?
Verse 1:
Young with dreams, ooo oo
had 'em for a long time ooo oo
well nothing's impossible
as long as you put your mind to it.
Sometimes you wanna let go
hold on tight
but you gotta believe 
with God on your side
Chorus:
Does Anybody hear me?
Is anybody listening to what's going on?
Before we move on.
Does Anybody Hear me?
Is anybody listening?
How can we change hate?
before it's too late?
Verse 2:
Happy, ooo oo 
that's all you'll ever wanna be. ooo oo
Well, knowledge is power, 
Absorb as much as you need
At times I feel like love passed me by 
just imagine how the kids feel inside.
Chorus:
Does Anybody hear me?
Is anybody listening to what's going on?
Before we move on.
Does Anybody Hear me?
Is anybody listening?
How can we change hate?
before it's too late?
Does Anybody hear me? When you feel you need a friend
                    Anybody listening...
Is anybody listening to what's going on?
                on.... yeah, yeah, yeah 
Before we move on.
