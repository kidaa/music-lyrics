it's a winter day five years too late 
i'm feelin' cold inside 
holdin' on to what i don't know 
no more reasons no more wise 
just my life and my love i worked so hard to keep 
oooh sad but true 
sad but true 
it will be a very different world without him 
so i just can't up and let him go 
what would my children say 
mad just a little sad 
just a little had just a little 
had just a little time for me 
not good you see 
i need just a little more 
just a little life just a little 
had just a little fun you see 
there's more to me 
when you're creepin' out at night 
always tried to cry myself to sleep 
sad but true it won't work no more 
i must tell him so 
goodbye is so hard to say 
so sad but true 
so sad but oh so true 
a world of make believe 
it's a place i've lived 
joyous all the time 
never knew my world could cave in 
fall in right before my eyes i was blind 
i would only see the signs i wanted to see 
ooh ooh ooh sad but true 
sad but true 
and it will 
you must take the time to deal with it 
before you fall too deep in it 
can't find your way back home ooh 
can't change his ways 
won't change my ways 
if things stay the same 
no one wins the game 
i deserve better 
he needs it better 
i'm not so happy he can't be happy 
oh oh 
and i feel it in my soul 
our love has come to an end 
sad but true it's not love no more 
i must tell him so 
goodbye is so hard to say 
so sad but true 
so sad but oh so true
