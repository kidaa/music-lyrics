My heart's in chains
And still remains in Deja Vu
But first I wanna spend the night with you
Everything you need
Come get it from me
Set your emotions free
Oh, yes baby
Come on and give in the name of love
And let our bodies slowly touch
Tonight let's move on
Chorus:
Yes I do
Take you to be
How about you and me
Damn I wanna be your lover
Don't refuse
Cuz I need you
Damn I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your love, your lover, oh baby, yeah, yeah
Verse 2:
Why don't you stay
Desert will make you
Call out my name
My first and my last name
That she is being
All you'll ever need
To take you higher than eyes can see
Oh, yes baby
Why don't you give in the name of love
And let our bodies be common
Cuz tonight I wanna give you all
Baby, let's move on
Repeat 1
I wanna be your lover, your lover, your lover, baby
I don't wanna have to compromise
The things you make me visualize
Intuition keeps on telling me
These emotions need to be set free
Don't you want to give it to me
We'll feel the heaven's prophecy
Take a visit to my paradise
We can hang around
For the rest of our lives
Repeat 1 until fade
