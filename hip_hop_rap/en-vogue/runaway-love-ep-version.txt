Are you ready to roll?/Funky divas, with a cool isle stroll/Sending smooth vibes to all our great fans/It feels good to be grooving again.
Chocolate cream to me baby so sweet to me/Like some honey to a honey bee/I am drawn to you baby like a strong magnet-oh!/Once I'm there, there's no turning back/There is no real excuse, for take this abuse/I keep running back, taking slack-don't know what to say or to do/It's amazing, but I'm not crazy/I can't win/It's a sin, so I feel I have to fight out
chorusRunaway love/Like a train on open tracks now/It's too hard to turn it back now/Feels good without a doubt yeah/Has to stop before it turns me out.
Oh I'm not qualified to put up with games with outI've been hurt hard lately I'm not for being used no more/Just a little lovin'/It's like a drug and I'm a drug addict/I just don't know why I just can't let go/I can't walk away, fade away, everyday my love grows and grows/It's cause of sickness/Or is it weakness/Should I cope?/Is there hope?/All I know is it's hard to go on.
chorus
High-h-h-hTake me/Take me, take mehigher, higherHigh-h-h-hOhhh, take me/repeat
chrousLike a triple contraction/It's too hard to turn it back/Feels good without a doubt yeah/Has to stop before it turns me out/Ohh, just a runaway love/Feel's good without a doubt baby/Has to stop before it turns me out.
