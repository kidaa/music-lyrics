chorus  
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings  
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings  

Here's a flow  
An En Vogue hip-hop intro  
Time to rap talk about the info  
Pertaining to the four  
Who re-opened the harmony door  
And let the vocals soar  

Shoo wop shoo wop  

All of the gossipin' it put us in a recite mode  
Unloadin' while the grooves explodin'  
Just steppin' and keepin' pepin'  
A vocal lethal-weapon  
In this song will be givin' ev-ology lessons  
About our history and our passin'  
How long steady, strong  
Will the En Vogue be lastin'?  
Askin' or predictin'  
The quad squad will roll  
And continue to kick it wicked  
Wicked doubts about the en-v  
It's envy if you ask me  
Trying to down Dawn, Maxine, Terry or Cindy  
Black, beautiful, intelligent  
Well structured and strong  
It's gonna be along for ever hold on  

repeat chorus  

It ain't over  

So, continuing my flow  
Goin' back about two years ago  
Lip-synching was the way to go, though  
a face to a voice, a voice to a face  
All the real talent was just going to waste  
The word was out  
A talent-search was on  
Auditioned with ambition  
A vision  
En Vogue was born  
To sing, the essential ingredients mended  
Four individuals perfectly blended  
Strong mind, positive, attitude is a must  
Group trust  
Eliminated the outside rush  
Using lies as alibis to get to us it's strange  
Negative attenion you gain in the world while you entertain  
Stuck up - of course not  
Just the knives in our back  
Those coming from behind on a publicity attack  
Not easy duplicating the four  
There's a lot more in store  
Until the fat lady roars  

repeat chorus  

People wonder if we're rich  
I'll tell you this  
More money now than before the music hit  
And our hair, of course it's real  
We just jazz it up a bit for the sex appeal  
And no we don't lip-synch  
It's all from the heart  
2 Tuff-Enuff Productions put us on the charts  
A few answers I thought I should give  
For the minds who enquire how the En Vogue lives  
Born to sing, and we proved it  
A gift from the man above  
Peace to our fans, and to competitors  
One love  
Sorry, not in it for the competition status-quo  
Our only perspective is to grow  
And to blow, ya know  
In house, in reggae, in rock, En Vogue  
Stylin' profilin' sippin' coke with a smile  
2 Tuff funk it, pump it, hip-hop jump it  
Now En Vogue's comin' versatile  

Shoo wop shoo wop  

repeat chorus  

It ain't over  
Got a long way to go  

repeat chorus until fade-out
