I lived part of my life
Being scared of my dreams
Everytime someone asks
What I'm shooting for in life
I would hide my true feelings
And when I spoke up to my friends
They made fun of my dreams
So when times got too rough
I would think back on one thing
My mama would say to me
chorus:this is your life, live it your own way
Forces of evil struck back and forth
Throughout my younger days,
Because I would listen
And care what other people would say
Like a four letter word
I ignored the whole world
And built my own tiny world with respect
But it took time to relate
What my momma would say time after time again, she said:
chorus
