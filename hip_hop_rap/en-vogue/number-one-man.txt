Number One Man
Well, five long years and then there it go
He met his friends, and took that bonding road
Never knew where the road would end up, no, no
Sometimes it feels like hell to me, yea
I gotta keep it together cuz it's good for me
Chorus
Sometimes you make me laugh
Sometimes you can make me cry
But I know that I love you
Your a very good friend of mine
Even though we may have fights
We know it's a part of life
Wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Just trust in me, you'll always be 
My number one man, yea
I have no questions, so there is no answers, uh-uh
What's to be, is meant to be, oh yes it is
But it feels like treason, every time I reason 
Found me parting ways with you
So tell me, what's a girl to do
I guess I'm stuck with you, yea
Chorus
The part of life remains the same
That you made me see, just what it means to me
To have someone that you can count on
When things are right, and sometimes wrong
What a small price to pay
I bless the day you came my way
Chorus
My man
My number one man
I said you always gonna be my man, yeah
My number one man ohhh, yea
Said your gonna always always gonna be my number one man
