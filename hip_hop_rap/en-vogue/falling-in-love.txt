falling in love 
it grabs me it scares me 
it knows how to inform me 
falling in love 
it takes me on a journey 
of emotions deep inside me 
falling in love 
nothing prepared me 
for this feeling that i'm feeling 
falling in love 
it's draining it's wearing 
i surrender completely 
ooh i wasn't ready for this 
it's good it's bad 
i'm happy and i'm sad 
a mystery to behold 
it speaks only to heart and soul 
like a melody deep inside of me 
i saw that love keeps playing on and on 
a symphony so glad i hear 
angels whispering 
falling in love 
it grabs me it scares me 
it knows how to inform me 
falling in love 
it takes me on a journey 
of emotions deep inside me 
falling in love 
nothing prepared me 
for this feeling that i'm feeling 
falling in love 
it's draining it's wearing 
i surrender completely 
i never knew that life could be 
so heavenly i'm feeling free 
oh how could something be so satisfying 
and yet a feeling of fearfulness 
is lurking in the mist of the bliss 
inside my heart but i know that's all a part 
falling in love 
it grabs me it scares me 
it knows how to inform me 
falling in love 
it takes me on a journey 
of emotions deep inside me 
falling in love 
nothing prepared me 
for this feeling that i'm feeling 
falling in love 
it's draining it's wearing 
i surrender completely 
i'm a business queen 
in a courtroom kingdom 
but when it comes to love 
there's no software made for that 
love oh love you came 
you turned my perfect world upside down 
like a work of art 
love has shaped my heart 
falling in love 
it grabs me it scares me 
it knows how to inform me 
falling in love 
it takes me on a journey 
of emotions deep inside me 
falling in love 
nothing prepared me 
for this feeling that i'm feeling 
falling in love 
it's draining it's wearing 
i surrender completely
