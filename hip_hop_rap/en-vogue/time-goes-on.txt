Intro:
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
repeat x14
chorus
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
repeat
I'm seem forever, since time began
So full of mysteries we don't understand
Searching for answers and remedies
As problems plague us like an enemy
bridge
Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on
chorus
So many blinded by life today
When will we realize love the only way
It's time to wake up
'Cause times have changed
Time waits for no one
It's a crucial game
bridge
chorus
Take care of business, don't procrastinate
We must decide on what becomes our fate
Nation to nation, love is the key
Let's take the time we need more unity
