i had a love 
and i had pain 
best believe 
they come hand in hand 
cause i'm a soldier 
for the love brigade 
i'm prepared to do battle 
with anything 
i have control of my life you see 
let's keep it real not to make believe 
i won't get caught with my foot in my mouth 
and i won't let love take me out 
i have the power to do as i please 
i take the blows and i do it with ease 
i dish it out very hard there's no doubt 
and i won't let love take me out 
i had to be 
a fool indeed 
to let someone 
break me down to my knees 
i was wreckless 
with my heart you see 
there's no rule for that in my world 
and yet that's plan 
say bye bye to the teary brown eyes 
and the big sad face with an upside down smile 
it's so beneath me it's so beneath 
say bye bye to the meaningless days 
and the loneliest nights 
just wasting my mind 
it's so beneath me it can't control me 
i have control of my life you see 
let's keep it real not to make believe 
i won't get caught with my foot in my mouth 
and i won't let love take me out 
i have the power to do as i please 
i take the blows and i do it with ease 
i dish it out very hard there's no doubt 
and i won't let love take me out 
i have control of my life you see 
let's keep it real not to make believe 
i won't get caught with my foot in my mouth 
and i won't let love take me out 
i have the power to do as i please 
i take the blows and i do it with ease 
i dish it out very hard there's no doubt 
and i won't let love take me out 
won't take me out won't take me out 
won't take me out won't take me out 
won't take me out won't take me out 
me out me out me out 
time to rise 
time to shine 
never again 
cause i decline 
to be a victim 
of a broken heart 
cause i found the goddess in me 
and now i leave my mark 
i have control of my life you see 
let's keep it real not to make believe 
i won't get caught with my foot in my mouth 
and i won't let love take me out 
i have the power to do as i please 
i take the blows and i do it with ease 
i dish it out very hard there's no doubt 
and i won't let love take me out 
repeat x3 
i have the power to do as i please 
i won't let it take me out 
i dish it out very hard there's no doubt 
and i won't let love take me out
