Me and my friends, we went out last night
To a small simple club on the nights
It didn't have much room, but hell they never do
Just chairs, a few tables, and some food
A small cramped band started playing, and all the room was swaying
Soon I found myself dancing, with a tall dark man
I was in a trance, a sort of romance
Between the rhythm and my soul, ohh
Chorus
Oooh, I wake up in the morning
And it's all me, I can hear the calling
And it's haunting each and everything
I didn't know my Latin love was oh so strong
Even in the middle of romancing, really love the rhythm when I'm dancing
Can't deny the spirit when you feel the Latin soul
After that night, my life had changed
I had no control and now I would behave
Every chance I got, I was at the club
Wining and dining like there was no tomorrow
Ooooh, oooh, So free
Ooooh, oooh, So me, yea yea
Ooooh, oooh, So lifting
And I don't want it to stop, no
Chorus 2x
If your life can't seem to get going, hopelessness is showing
To your soul, and to Latin
Get into the sounds, of the rhythms beating out
Cuz when your dancing, your spirit will be free, yea
Ooooh, oooh, So free yea
Ooooh, oooh, So me, yea yea
Ooooh, oooh, So uplifting, yea
And I don't want it to stop, no
Chorus 3x
