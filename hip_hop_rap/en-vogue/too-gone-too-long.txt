Did I hear you say that
You want another chance 
You need another try 
You're ready to reclaim your prize
So you want my love back 
Why'd you let it slip away 
Why'd you ever let me go 
Your change of heart has come too late
Well the door is locked you can't get in 
The game has changed you've been 
Chorus: 
Too gone, too long baby
To ever get back again 
In my heart 
Too gone, too long baby
You're too many tears too late
To ever get back to get back 
In my arms 
Been gone too gone too long
Verse 2:
Didn't you hear me say that
You'd be a fool to leave 
You'd regret the road you chose
You'd come running right back to me
You had such a good love sugar 
You never found in no one else 
But what I knew all the time 
You had to find out for yourself 
But now you'll never know 
That love again 
You're on your own 
chorus Bridge:
Did you really think I'd take you back 
Let you back in my life 
Oh baby just like that 
Someone new is loving me
Loving you is what used to be 
Baby you're too late to win my heart again
chorus
