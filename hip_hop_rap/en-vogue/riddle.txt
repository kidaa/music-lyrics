Monday morning was the first time
That I noticed something strange
Going on with your kiss was not the same
Was it all just in my mind
Or was it something I should pay attention to?

Having lunch with friends I thought I saw your car
Leaving from our favorite restaurant but too far
For my eyes to see what I feel
Would be heartbreaking if what I saw was true

Everytime the phone would ring you'd say hello
But when I'd come around you'd say I gotta go
Your friends never called line two before
And I don't know nobody named Tyra

You left the house to go to work an hour earlier
Said you had some papers for your boss to sign
But you left your briefcase home
And when I called your job
They said you were not there, oh yeah

Friday night
Is the night we've always had our weekend date
But you showed up at the house extremely late
Without any conversation
You just went to bed and said that you're headached
Now it's the weekend
And you know that it's the day I do my cleaning
And when I washed your shirts I just could not believe 
I'm picking hair weave off your sleeve
Found a letter in your pocket from Louise, please
