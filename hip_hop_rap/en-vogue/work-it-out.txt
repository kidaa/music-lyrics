you know i got a thing for you 
i know you got a thing for me too 
so tell me baby what's it gonna be ooh 
here we are alone again 
just like before we had a chance 
for romance baby 
and now it's slippin' out our hands baby 
oh well 
sittin' here ain't got much to talk about 
what we gonna do to work it out 
cause this here's not enough 
we need changed 
sittin' here ain't got much to talk about 
what we gonna do to work it out 
cause this s is gettin' old 
the love is gone 
who's gonna be the first to say goodbye 
how do we choose 
when we have so much to lose 
stop it stop pretending nothing is wrong 
just admit this is it so we can move on 
cause i can't go on living my life this way 
day after day just sitting here 
sittin' here ain't got much to talk about 
what we gonna do to work it out 
cause this here's not enough 
we need changed 
sittin' here ain't got much to talk about 
what we gonna do to work it out 
cause this s is gettin' old 
we could be livin' like my dream fantasies 
where you hold me in your arms and kiss me so softly 
my thoughts would be always of you 
and the kind and gentle things you do yeah 
but reality pulls me out of my mind 
and instead of that i'm still sittin' here 
sittin' here ain't got much to talk about 
what we gonna do to work it out 
cause this here's not enough 
we need changed 
sittin' here ain't got much to talk about 
what we gonna do to work it out 
cause this s is gettin' old
