My crew 4X
[Cheeks]
Yo yo now now now now
When I wake up before I gather up my pens
I shine up my fronts I give a Dutch for all my mens
throw on some Marvin Gaye
I smoke my weed and clean my kitchen dishes
Tec to the sky see how mom's is always bitchin'
I'm done buffin' got my cheese my pen & paper
it's time for me here to prepare my caper
I written it down the line & now a ring is on my phone
it's my nigga Spigg Nice he tellin' me he in the zone
Yo I got the liquor the grain fool let's make a tape
I'm caught up in my own zone can't really escape
I ran it down the line as Easy Mo played the song
He checked my five he said to me yo later on
about an hour passes
about my loosey deuce deuce & my tinted glasses
I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin
cause that cat is up in class like a nickel & he wasn't
I'm concentratin' on these moves that I'ma soon be makin'
and once I break then I'ma show my peeps that I'm not fakin'
See my man Pop or Die from the block
niggas wearin' ? reverse as we handle barred it to the block
See certain situations happen
when you caught up in the 'hood in the game of rappin'
You see scrappin' now leads to cappin'
we used to have each other's back
what the fuck happened? Stupid
Yo fuck it
Anyway Mary ?Easter? record store
walked to the back now let me get a four
Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot
you get yours on & soon as you see 'em
the thieves turn the block
Jump on them right now when niggas chillin'
if you ever sported it you know how I'm feelin'
Cracked open my St. Ides took a squig
as Mama Blackwell whispered
You got it this time
He represents my Crew

Represent your Crew
He represents my Crew
You represent my Crew
We represent my Crew

[A+]
Which one of y'all think you ill enough to bust A+
get crushed by the stampede of the elephant tusks
We LB families niggas don't understand us
lyrical scanner diagnosin' niggas with cancer
you got a problem I got the answer
Twin Glocks goin' bananas
buckin' innocent bystanders son
the total sum is a mathmatical function
I used to get suspended for keepin' the class jumpin'
Had the blackboard with the chalk in my hand
Mr. Cheeks snatched the thieves off the Canibus plan
watched the crowd get amped
while they scream & chant
it's ill hot they can't keep still like a fire drill
We desire mils from 97 until
firin' high caliber steel on this battlefield

Strictly out for the fortune & fame
I entertain for my personal gain
rock the gold chains
big enough to cause neck pains
Canibus is my name
I be the last one to set it
You could find my name
in the Lost Boyz album credits

you'll see Cop killin' Queens in this mothafucker

I remember when them niggas first got signed

Now they gettin' mad airplay all over New York
