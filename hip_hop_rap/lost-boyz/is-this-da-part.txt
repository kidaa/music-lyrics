Verse 1
[Mr.Cheeks]

Verse 2
[Mr.Cheeks]
She said well listen
I don't know you from paint
well if you no bitch
then why reply if you aint
cuz see my bobo's mad strong
I never thought twice
that my wife would do wrong
I see her all the time
she's always home when I call her
I feel like a million bucks
takin flicks at the mall
I had it goin on for a minute
cuz it only took a minute
for another to run in it
had the..birds and the bees
lemonade and iced tea
man I went all out with ease
she was my main squeeze
tell me....
Chorus
Verse 3
[Mr.Cheeks]
now shorty rock, she had a nigga on lock
used to bring her friends through
to meet my mans on the block
and everything seemed love love yo
shorty was the one I was thinkin of so
whenever I used to listen to rumors
I would hit em till my man pulled me near
put a bug in my ear
listen shorty over there
wit the smile it be foul
just in a little while
seen her on the Isle
wit another kid, who just came home from a bid
we grabbed on that ass
all hugged up in front the crib.....
see what Im sayin
bitches  dont' appreciate nuthin man
2 dollar bitches wit 3 dollar haircuts yo know...
Chorus
Outro: Mr. Cheeks
have you ever me a girlie
that you really did want
tip up the phillie
light up the blunt
time to get puffed, huffed out my man
I bust wit my niggas
rest in peace to Cash
and niggas who pass
I get blast
up on the block, its 1 o'clock
runnin wit Tah, pretty Lou it's the crew
this is how it go
this is how we do
Bounce...
