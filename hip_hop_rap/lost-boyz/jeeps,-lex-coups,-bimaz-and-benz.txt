Verse One:
Whose the best whose the worst in this here rap game
for those who claim to be the best
I tear them out the frame
I'm representin' puttin' Queens on the map you wear
double springs, wit some baggy jeans when I rap
Come up with a style to make con-versital
don't treat me like no lame I've been in this game for awhile
I've seen alot ta come,come 
I've seen alot a gogo, I've seen alot ta break
I've seen alot to blow, a yo
It's a trip to see a nigga slip
Geta grip nigga, nigga geta grip, geta
You don't even know the half of my crew
to be talking, but you're talking and you act like you knew
Yo set it, you fuckin' crossed the line and hit the border
LB fam start attacking some attacking outa order
Put on your leather gloves, and hats and get your picture mats
and get the gats just in case you take it to the stacks
Chorus:
Shout out to the Jeeps, 
It's the Lex Coups, Bimas and the Benzand the Benz

so I can release some stress from my chest G
Is you down to go pound for pound, 
toe to toe, blow for blow, round for round
I'm wonderin' cuz I bring the thunder and the rain
causin' confusion to your brain
Chorus

Pack your bags, head outta town, 
I'll be back around so be gone before sundown
From Jamaica comes a nigga named Cheeks, 
with techniques of the streets
