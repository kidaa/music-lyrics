[Verse 1 - Tupac]
can't nobody stop us when were blunted up and swervin
packed in a suburban
screamin outlaw
runnin on the curb
they never try me
cause right behind me a killer team
I give the word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
this Hennessey will keep me calm though
sittin in the back of a club tradin convo
livin like a don in my own mind
sittin with kadafi nigga watch me with the chrome 9
all the time drinkin champagne
walk throught the crowd let the tramps hang
niggas play a hate but do a damned thang
picture me doin 80
down a one way
stuck in the trunk caught in gunplay
so I gotta keep my eyes open gettin high
wondering why we gotta die smokin, my alibi
like they gonna find me in the mark for death
spending my nights like it's the last one left
I'm an outlaw

[Chrous]
am I wrong
the one to get it goin on
the last to leave
til' I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar u could catch me
hands full of liquor
puffin on the sweetest swisher
cause I'm the last one left
tell me am I wrong
the one to get it goin on
the last to leave
til' I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar u could catch me
hands full of liquor
puffin on the sweetest swisher
cause I'm the last one left

[Verse 2 - Napoleon]
i got my back against the wall
gat chillen by my balls
why they tryin to rule this nigga thats only 5'6'' tall
the police only know that we outlaws
fuck fair
better strap down to the fullest cause we dont care
thug passion all up in me
feelin like i drunk some heny
it aint easy im tryin to make a dollar out of 2 pennys
war we got these rap niggas
wanna pull thier gat niggas
only got my side
cause they think pac died nigga
blast niggas with our tech
takin showers in our vests
pac come and catch reak nigga we the last one left

[Verse 3 - Tupac]
it be my only zone
inside my own dome
fresh out of jail
it was hell
but I'm finally home
lookin for niggas that was woofin that shit when i was locked back
hands on the pump make em jump when it cocked back
fuck em all they bitches inside a world of weak
bitch niggas be afraid to speak
be the last ones left

[Chorus]
tell me am I wrong
the one to get it goin on
the last to leave
til' I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar u could catch me
hands full of liquor
puffin on the sweetest swisher
cause I'm the last one left
tell me am I wrong
the one to get it goin on
the last to leave
til' I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar u could catch me
hands full of liquor
puffin on the sweetest swisher
cause I'm the last one left

[Verse 4 - Young Noble]
I eat and sleep the worst shit
cursed from birth
me and my team
super supreme
puttin in work
im past stuck
drunk as a fuck
til it hurt
and ill call earl
screamin fuck the world
I got a bitch on the side want to be my wife
and she wanna know is she gonna see me tonight
and i know it aint right
but its the life i got
and thats until i see god
and until i see pac
young noble i lost control
somebody hold me down
and if the world was a girl id stick my dick in the ground
fuck tha world
