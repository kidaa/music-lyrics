For all my low life thug niggas, 
For all my niggas in the hood, 
Livin the life of a ghetto star, 
Ha ha ha Makavelli, 

Just holla my name 
And witness game official 
Niggas is so shame 
They stare stiff like scared bitches 
While I remain inside a paradox 
Gone my block 
Though gun shots is promised to me when will I stop 
I hit the weed 
And hope to god I can fly high 
Witness my enemies 
Die when I ride by 
Ita's shit to try 
Send they bodies to they parents up north 
With they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off 
Fuck em all what I scream as I dream
