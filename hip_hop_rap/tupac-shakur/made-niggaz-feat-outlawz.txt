2Pac: Spoken

No one seperates what we create
Unstoppable, untouchable
Motherfuckin world wide mob figures
Death Row at its finest
M.O.B. thugs for motherfuckin life
Motherfuckin made niggas
We comin after these niggas world wide
Feel me
Makaveli The Don

My life in exchange for yours
Born hated as a thug
House full of babies cryin
From a lack of gettin love
Won't nobody tell me shit
Till I got a sac of drugs
At the block sewn up
Cause I wanna pack a gun
Do you feel me?
World do ya hear me?
Catch a risin' star
Fuck the love
Niggas fear me
Got these niggas runnin all wild
From my double R when we ride
Motherfuckers is sure to die
Boom once I enter the room
In the air all you hear
Is the whispers of doom
Niggas scared
They don't wanna see me head on
Think of all the busters
That I had to leave dead and gone
Called a brave nigga
Fuckin with a made nigga
M.O.B. gun fire
Gettin sprayed quicker
Fuck em all let em understand
My plot to get richer
Much more than 6 figures
A motherfuckin made nigga
Feel me

Motherfuckin Made Niggas
Made Niggas
I got a plot to get richer
Take my picture
A made nigga

Napolean:

Nigga I was raised on the streets
I had to hustle just to eat
My role model was killin niggas
So I know I would never be weak
They got me sittin wonderin
Where my life begins
These niggas cross my father
Then my father cross them
Cause I role with Immortal Thugs Niggas
And my number one plan
To kill a man and grab a needle
And drug niggas
Niggas don't like us
Because they bitches straight love us
The president told us to leave
Cause the government don't want us
It's Napolean
I get my pleasure out of sin and seeing
Plus billin shit
Cause I seen it at the beginning
A Made Nigga

Khadafi:

How many niggas fall in ya vision
Gunnin em down for every last minute
That I spent in prison
We mash together
Plus we get cash together
Blast whenever
Knowin it don't last forever
It's only one way out
And one way in
Motherfuckers cross
And get crossed out
Never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups
Like rock block raute
I can't be touched
Cause of the weapons I clutch
And them niggas that I'm unda
Is just to much
We Made Niggas

E.D.I. Idi Amin:


Picture the scenery
So now you gonna have to imagine
Call me a prophet
cause I predicted whats going to happen
I be gettin the paper stackin
At those who be paper snatchin
While their mugs got cracked in the 80's
Baby, maybe thats if I slip
But I became official
Since the start of this
Idi Amin born July
7 of fushid eyes
Plus wit all this gave me they hate to cherish
But still I made it
A made nigga made by the game
Made for war
My aim is simple and plain
Yah wether its cane
Or these tracks made for ya brain
You'll forever know my name
Idi Amin

Hussein:

I aint killed my line, my strap, my head
There will be none of that
The young hog Kato playin
Outlaw immortal combat
With the criminal skill
they can't beat me a nigga
Till we still, and chill
Recognize the real deal
Still a nigga made when I was young
And dumb with a gun but it pays
So I'm bustin for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all going to die
Get yours cause I'm a get mine.

Castro:

Tha Outlawz
We be the Don Wons of this rough shit
Minds baptize your moms
While paralyzin the public
Wit my mentality of war
Dead bodies and silence
Give it to ya raw
Thug nigga to the core
It was also livin poor
Got me thinkin on a made level
Shootin my gauge to get paid
A fuckin crazed devil
Mad shit from here to there
Day by day
Year to year
Made Niggas on your motherfuckin shit

2Pac:

ha ha ha
Call me a Bad Boy killer
Murder motherfuckers daily
Know the fed trail me
So my alias is Makaveli
Gettin lessons from niggas in penitentieries
Game when I'm high
Help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage
I'll display my rage
Surround the court building
With the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'm going, and finally sentenced
On my knees to God
Beggin for repentence
I'm convinced that I'm a thug
They got me feenin for my cash
Like a feen when he dreams of drugs
Get the dollar
And I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral
And tell yah just who gave the order
Makaveli The Don, til I'm gone
I maintain my army of lunatics
That stay armed til the day I die
I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw til the grave a motherfuckin made nigga.

2Pac: Spoken
