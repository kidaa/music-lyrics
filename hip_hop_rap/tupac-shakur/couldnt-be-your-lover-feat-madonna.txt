[Madonna] 

I don't know where the steps.. 

[2Pac] 

Hey, they minds diffrent from what they lips say 
even when the media is gettin greedia you wake they hips sway 
hitin with the bomb ambition. 
i caught you peepin, no more sleepin 
i got you freakin through the through whole weekend. 
fakes speakin, is it mashin or just they heat 
try to get me all up in your satan sheets. 
what they say, a blonde and a thug brotha 
the way you gettin paid, i wish was lovers 

{chorus}x2 

now i could be your sister, i could be your mother 
we could be friends and i could even be your brother 
but i, couldnt be your lover 

[Madonna] 

all that i know, is i just dont undertsand 
is that my happieness 
always lyes in the palm of your hands 
i know what youre thinkin next 
would it be better if i loved you less? 
sometimes i think that i made you up 
but would it be better if i gave u up 

{repeat Madonnas verse} 

{chorus}x3
