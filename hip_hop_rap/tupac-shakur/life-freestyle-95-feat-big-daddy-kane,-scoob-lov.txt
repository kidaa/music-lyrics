BIG DADDY KANE] Where's 2Pac and Biggie Smalls 
*crowd goes nuts* 

[SCOOB] 
Check it, check it, check it, check it 
This here's for the motherfucking record 
Here we here we here we go 
Can I can I get a motherfucking flow 
chitty chitty bang bang, I chitty bang bang 
Motherfucking niggaz can't hang 
Well oh no, I'm lettin niggaz know they can't hang 
Don't give me no lip, don't give me no backtalk, don't break North 
Don't make me get my gat and blow YOUR MOTHERFUCKIN HEAD OFF 
Once again, niggaz know my name, GOD DAMMIT 
Give me the mike and watch me slam it 
hard like Shaquille, oh you better kneel 
when you see me coming, big scoob got em running 
I'm coming, I'm taking the dough 
you couldn't hit me even if you had an afro 
So dont try me, you better walk by me 
I'll do you like the first part in Menace to Society 
Like Cypress Hill, yo, I'm insane 
I'll shoot a hole in your toe 
I'll make you jump like the House of Pain 
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang 
Niggas cant hang, niggaz cant hang 
Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang, motherfucking niggas can't hang 

[Biggie Smalls] 
Gonna do it like this 
WHERE BROOKLYN AT, WHERE BROOKLYN AT 
WHERE BROOKLYN AT, WHERE BROOKLYN AT 
I got seven Mack 11's, about eight 38's 
Nine 9's, ten mack tens, my shit never ends 
You can't touch my riches 
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches 
Biggie Smalls 
The millionare, the mansion, the yacht 
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks 
Guess how I got the weed spot 
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread 
Little Gotti got the shotty at your body 
so don't resist with your mike this Christmas 
I tote guns, I make number runs 
I give mc's the runs dripping 
when I throw my clip in the AK, I spray from far away 
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K 
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo 
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the ya-yo 
That's crazy blunts, mad L's, my voice excells 
from the avenue to jail cells 
Oh my god, I'm dropping shit like a pigeon 
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at their christenings 

[2PAC] Motherfucking Biggie Smalls! 
[BIG DADDY KANE] Now I wanna see what 2Pac gonna do with it 

2PAC] 
I get my protection from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson 
And all my niggaz in the pen, here we go again 
Ain't nothing separating us from a mack ten 
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older 
A straight soldier, bucking at them busters 
No matter how you try, niggaz never die 
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply 
??? 
I'm sideways motherfucker crime pays! 
Fucking cops wth their lights on 
Zig zaggin through the freeway 
chase me nigga in a high speed chase with the law 
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw 

[BDK] Now I wanna see what my man Shyheim gonna do with it 

[SHYHEIM] 
Times is gettin hard, word is bond, I swear God 
I even got caught tryin to steal from the junkyard 
A born devil, a rebel without a pause 
Ain't never had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus 
I walk the streets at night with my head down 
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down 
So they get a glock a lick shots to get props 
And when shit rocks so you can hear when the shells drop 
An old man got shot in the parkin lot 
In front of my buildin I hang with his grandchildren 
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide 
and hide, but he got knocked by the homicide 
And this happens everyday around my way 
So I pray that I can live another day 

[BIG DADDY KANE] 
Now what's the bullshit niggaz been saying 
Dont try to act like Martin, man, with that "I was just playing" 
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on 
Cmon now motherfucker, your teeth is gone 
Just cause you rap dont meant that youre catching wreck with me 
Step to this I'll give your mike a vasectomy 
I only know one nigga that can come next to me 
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow 
A battle, I gots to have it ???? 
Cause when it comes to going against Kane rapping 
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nothin happenin 
Non resistable, non competible 
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fucking incredible 
And let's just get one more thing understood 
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon sound good
