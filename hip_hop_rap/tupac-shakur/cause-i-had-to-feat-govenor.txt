[Intro] 

[2Pac & Govenor] 

Why did you slang crack 
I had to 
Why did you pack the straps 
Cause I had to 
Why did you jack the scratch 
Cause I had to 
Say what 
Say what 
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent 
Pac 
You certified crazy 

Verse 1 

[2Pac] 

I got to work 
With what you gave me 
Claimin' I'm a criminal 
And you the one 
That made me 
They got me trapped 
In this slavery 
Now I'm lost 
In this Holocaust 
Headed for my grave G 
I told Sam 
He could fuck the war 
And got a busted jaw 
For sayin' fuck the law 
And if you wonder 
Why I'm mad 
Check the record 
What's a nigga got to do 
To get respected 
Sometime's I think 
I'm gettin' tested 
And if I don't say yes 
A nigga's quick 
To get arrested 
That's the reason 
I stay zested 
I keep a vest 
On my chest 
In case the cops 
Are gettin' restless 
Walk around 
Ready to light shit up 
And since 
My life is fucked 
Some say 
I'm slightly nuts 
Buck 
Buck 
Is the sound 
As I move up 
Other niggas pay attention 
When I'm fool 
But 
Uh 
They make a nigga 
Be a killer 
I used to be a dealer 
But they wanted to see 
Who's realer 
Now them same muthafuckas 
Wanna murder me 
And I wonder 
If the Lord 
Ever heard of me 
Uh 
I need loot 
So I'm doin' 
What I do 
And don't say shit 
Until you've walked 
In my shoes 
There was no other destiny 
To choose 
I had nothin' left to lose 
So I'm 
Singin' 
Singin' nigga blues 

Chorus 

[2Pac & Govenor] 

Can't you see 
We're raised 
To all be thugs 
Make's us 
Do the things we do 
Got to let a Outlaw 
Make moves 
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent 

Why did you slang crack 
Cause I had to 
Why did you pack straps 
Cause I had to 
Why did you jack the scratch 
Cause I had to 
Uh 
Uh 
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent 

Verse 2 

[2Pac] 

Poppa need 
Brand new shoes 
But what the fuck 
Can a nigga do 
My little boy 
Got to eat to 
So why must I 
Sock a fellow 
Just to live large 
Like Rockafella 
And did you ever 
Stop to think 
I'm old enough 
To go to war 
But I ain't 
Old enough to drink 
Cops want to hit me 
With the book 
Ha 
And you're hooked 
On my eye 
Don't give a fuck look 
Make your rules 
I'm a break 'em 
No matter how much you make 'em 
You show me bacon 
I'm a take 'em 
So don't you ever tempt me 
I'm a fool 
For mine nigga 
And my pockets 
Stay empty 
To my brothers 
In the party 
Yo 
You livin' worse 
Than the niggas 
In the ghetto 
So 
I give a fuck 
About your language 
Or complection 
You got love 
From the niggas 
In my section 
Got love 
You got problems 
With the punk police 
Don't run 
From the chumps 
Get the pump 
From me 
We ain't free 
I'll be damned 
If I played a trick 
For a blonde hair 
Blue-eyed 
Caucasion bitch 
Bitch 
Down with my homeboy Rich 
Uh 
Fuck a snitch 
And a groupie ass bitch 
And the nigga 
With the cellular phone 
Leave his baby at home 
So he can go out and bone 
Uh 
You ain't right 
And you wonder 
Why we blazin' niggas 
Cause you punks 
Havin' babies 
Can't raise the niggas 
What's up kid 
And they bound 
To be fuck-up's too 
Drinkin' forties of brew 
Say what 
Say what 
Singin' nigga blues 

Chorus 

[2Pac & Govenor] 

Why did you slang crack 
Cause I had to 
Why did you pack straps 
Cause I had to 
Why did you jack the scratch 
Cause I had to 
Come on 
Come on 
Now I'm headin' for the muthafuckin' penn 

Why did you slang crack 
Cause I had to 
Why did you pack straps 
Cause I had to 
Put them cops on they backs 
Cause I had to 
Uh huh 
Right 
Now I'm headin' for the muthafuckin' penn
