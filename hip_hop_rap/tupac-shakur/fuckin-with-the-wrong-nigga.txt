Ha ha, niggas
Fucking with the wrong nigga 

My seductive introduction
Be specific, still elusive
But exclusives what I give you when I kick it
And I'm still lifted
Niggas can't get with Mr.Wicked
Picture me flipping
My adversaries getting the dick swiftly
Niggas is swinging wild but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch with your whole click
And still get treated shitty
Business never personal, I'm up before the sun come up
I'm tired
Just a ghetto star
A drop-top double R is what I'm riding
Nigga if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring your artillery
When you come for me cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast
Cuz Syke was busting
Plus Bo had em ducking screaming get they cash
So...
So now I got the law on me
My phones tapped, so I had to send word through my little homies
Tell them niggas just be here when they pull the trigger
Shit
This is what you get, for fucking with the wrong nigga 

This is what you get when your
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Ha ha, yeah nigga
Peep

Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray
And thank the lord for giving me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful man, but still
When niggas come for me, all I can see is getting em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Perfect my thoughts flowing on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peel
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give em the mack and make em spray yourself
Hey
Falling legends, clutching chrome 3-5-7
Putting two bullets to they dome
Wanted to die in heaven
While calling shots nobody real as clear its me
Ain't trying to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes, get disposed of
We all homies till the death
So my true niggas show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle
A negative figure
But why they fucking with the wrong nigga?

You know, its like ...
Why you fucking with the wrong nigga?

I was raised by thugs
Schooled by killers
Learned my mathematic skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die cause we tried peace
I die on these streets
Blast till they recognize
Still do or die
All my niggas getting high watching time fly
Best strategize on a way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can't stop it
Then keep it popping a lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch and now this new shit gon' fade em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some backup
The little homies and my dogs in a black truck
Buck Buck was the sound
As they gats burst
No need for ambulance
Baby bring the black hearse
Shoulda never fucked around buster
How you figure making moves on the wrong nigga?
This what it sounds like
Bing, Bing, Bing
When you fucking with the wrong nigga
Niggas getting hit when they fucking with the wrong nigga
Fucking with the wrong nigga
