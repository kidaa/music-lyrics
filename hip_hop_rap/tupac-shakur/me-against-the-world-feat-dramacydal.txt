It's just me against tha World 
ooohhhhh ooohhhhh 
just me against tha world baby 
ohhhhhh ohhhhhh 
I got nothin' ta lose 
it's just me against tha world 
ohhhhh 
stuck in tha game 
me against tha world baby 
Can you picture my prophecy? 
stress in tha city 
tha cops is hot for me 
tha projects is full of bullets 
tha bodies is droppin' 
there ain't no stoppin me 
constantly moven while maken millions 
witnessin' killins 
leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings 
caries tha children 
cause they're illin' 
addicted to killin' 
a near appeal from tha cap pealin' 
what i'm feelin' 
but will they last or be blasted 
hard headed bastard 
maybe he'll listen in his casket 
tha aftermath 
more bodies being buried 
i'm losen my homies in a hurry 
they're relocating to tha cemetary 
got me worried 
stressin' 
my visions bluried 
tha question is will I live 
no one in tha world loves me 
i'm headed for danger 
don't trust strangers 
put one in tha chamber 
whatever i'm feelin' is anger 
don't wanna make excuses 
cause this is how it is 
what's tha use 
unless we're shootin' 
no one notices tha youth 
It's Just Me against tha World baby 
Chorus 
ooohhhhh 
Me against tha world 
It's Just me against tha World 
ooohhhhh 
It's Just Me Against tha World 
Me Against tha World 
cause it's just me against tha world baby 
Me against tha World 
ooohhhh yeeah 
I got nothin' ta lose 
It's Just me against tha world baby 
I got nothin' ta lose 
[Dramacydal's verse] 
Could somebody help me? 
i'm out here all by myself 
seeing ladies in stores 
baby capones 
livin wealthy 
pictures of my birth 
on tha surface what i'm dreamin' 
seein' daddy seein' 
full of crooked deamons 
already crazy and screamin' 
I guess them nightmares as a child 
had me scared 
but left me prepared 
for awhile 
is there another route? 
for crooked outlaws 
that are in a villian of young thugs 
everday is more death 
plus i'm more rollin 
i'm seein more beatens 
for me 
to proceed with fear 
scheme on schemeing 
amd leavin' their peeps grievin' 
cause ain't no bucks ta stack up 
my nuts is backed up 
i'm about ta act up 
go load tha mack up 
now watch me klack up 
try makin' fat cuts 
but yo it ain't workin 
and evils lurken 
I can see him smirken 
when I gets tha bourbon 
so what 
go put some work in 
and make my mail 
makin' sells 
risken 25 with a 'L' 
but oh well 
Chorus 
Me Against tha World 
with nothin' ta lose 
it's just me against tha world 
ooohhhh 
It's just Me Against tha World baby 
Me Against tha world 
I got nothin' ta lose 
It's just Me Against tha World 
heeeyyy 
It's just Me Against tha World baby 
with nothin ta lose 
it's just me against tha world baby 
Me against tha world 
Me against tha world 
I got nothin' ta lose 
it's just me against tha World baby 
heeeyyy 
[Tupac's verse] 
With all this extra stressin' 
tha question I wonder is after death 
I feel my last breath 
when will I finaly get to rest from this supression 
they punish tha people that's askin questions 
and those that possess 
steal from tha ones without possesions 
tha message I stress 
to make it stop 
study your lessons 
don't settle for less 
even tha genius asks questions 
be gratifull for blessins 
don't ever change 
keep your essense 
tha powers in tha people and tha politics we address 
always do your best 
don't let this pressure make ya panic 
and when ya get stranded 
and things don't go tha way ya planed it 
dreaming of richs 
in a position of makin' a difference 
polititions and hipocrites 
they don't wanna listen 
if i'm insane 
then tha fame ain't about ta change 
it wasn't nothin' like tha game 
it's just me Against tha World 
Chorus 
Me against tha World 
nothin ta lose 
It's just Me Against tha world baby 
Me Against tha World 
got me stuck in tha game 
It's just Me Against tha World 
ooohhhh 
i'm outshining [???] tha news 
It's just me against tha world baby 
hahaha 
Me against tha World 
that's right... 
I know it seem hard someties, but uh... 
remember one thing 
through every dark night 
there's a bright day after that 
so no matter how hard it get 
stick ya chest out 
keep ya head up 
and handle it 
Me against tha World 
Me against tha world 
Me against tha world 

fades...
