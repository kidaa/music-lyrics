[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now I was born in the gutter facin life or death
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I
to try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggaz fry
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessey
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me procede
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's poppin ain't no love bitch
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm tryin to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dyin days
Ain't nuttin wrong with gettin paid, so nigga blaze
Cause we some motherfuckin fools
Walkin through the streets wearin jewels, breakin niggaz makin moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
when they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessey

[Chorus w/ minor variations]

[Verse Two: Edi Amin]
Yeah
Up late nights c'mon under the city lights
The Henn got me feelin right, I'm tryin to keep from swervin
She's so fine and she love Henn too
After a couple of shots she said, "I could do what I wanna do"
That's right We ain't sippin champagne nah we off the Henn-Rock
Alcoholics back at the liquor sto' cause we can't stop can't stop
And won't stop we won't stop all night long
'til the break of dawn, gettin it on, Hennessey

[Sleepy Brown]
Ooooh, lady watchin lady watchin as I'm glidin by glidin by
And the place is jumpin.. that I can't deny no, noo, no
Ooh I can't wait to go in, throw my glass in the sky glass in the sky
For the people partyin, 'til the mornin light

[Chorus w/ minor variations]

[2Pac] Hahaha, y'all niggaz can't fuck with this ol' thug shit

[Chorus]

[Sleepy Brown - over Chorus second half]
We keep on sippin, and sippin, and sippin

[S.B.] Keep on sippin, and sippin, and sippin, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh, Hennessey
