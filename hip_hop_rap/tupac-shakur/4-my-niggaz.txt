[2Pac] 
HaHa thats right 
Allright, Storm mutherfuckers 
Ain't really knowing if you can flow or not 
So do this shit like last time. 

Verse 1 

[2Pac] 
Holler my name nigga 
You riding to scream 
Must be a thug with a heart 
To be a part of my team 
It seems we got a problem 
We ain't letting no women 
And the feminine side 
Has been denied time to give em a try 

[Storm] 
Finally made it now fuck us 
Now who the dopest 
The brothers or the sisters 
I agree its a mans world 
But why must niggaz diss us 
I ain't trying to hear it 
Witness my thug spirit 

[2Pac] 
They keep on screaming bitches 

[Storm] 
Cuz Niggaz love to hear it 
Called on my dawgs cuz they rowdy 
Then a motherfucker 
I love you niggaz like brothers Pac laughs 
But don't fuck with me 

[2Pac] 
Oh bad now, look what we got 
Miss Billy Badass packing double glocks ugh 
So all you niggaz be warned 
From the dusk till the dawn 
We might trip but I dare you tricks 
To fuck around with Storm 
We Outlawz I said it and meant it 
And when you see my live on tv 
Its strictly representing 
Now let me hear you scream 

Chorus 

[2Pac] 
This is for my niggaz 
Only for my niggaz 
For my niggaz 
Let me see you throw your hands up 

[Storm] 
This is for my sistas 
Only for my sistas 
For my sistas 
Let me see you throw your hands up 

Verse 2 

[2Pac] 
Now when I say Pig 
You say B-I-G 
When I say BadBoy Killa 
Then you say ME 
When I say Puffy is a punk 
You scream word on my life 
I wrote this shit while fucking Bigs wife 

[Storm] 
Now I been told that Lil Kim thinks she hot 

[2Pac] 
She not 

[Storm] 
Better get that additude adjusted 
Fore I mash your spot 

[2Pac] 
Plus now Da Brats tripping 

[Storm] 
Must want an ass whipping 

[2Pac and Storm] 
We be the first ones to fuck with you 
And BadBoy wack bitch 

[2Pac] 
Busting through Brooklyn 
Licking my chops through Queens 
Cuz I'm looking for Little Shawn 
That bitch ass fiend 
I made him scream like last year 
Best don't come to California 
We don't want your busta ass here 

[Storm] 
We Outlaw riders 
Thugs till we die 
Sistas get they groove on 

[2Pac and Storm] 
Niggaz getting high 

[2Pac] 
Call me a motherfucking troublemaker 
Send me to jail 
But watch me bust on L.L. 
Now let me hear you scream 

Chorus 

[2Pac] 
This is for my niggaz 
Only for my niggaz 
For my niggaz 
Let me see you throw your hands up
