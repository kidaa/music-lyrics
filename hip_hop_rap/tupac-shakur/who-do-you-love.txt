Maybe its the thug in me

verse 1
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggaz slangin drugs
Im runnin from the narcs when they pass by dont ask why
Im a hustler till my ass die
Even if I do come up I be ready when they run up, huh
Ill be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all, fucking with them tramp ass sluts who suppose to
fall
since she played you for you money but the shit was cool
Guess its true niggaz be bitches 2
you cant see how she worked you, all up in her skirt
now you looking like a jerk, cause she hurt you
now heads up dont be a playa hater
Just peep game keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
see hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
hand it over motherfucker fore I shoot
Who do u love

chorus x2
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Who do you love?


verse 2
Im livin that
Thug life baby, steady smoking indo going crazy
baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
we in the dark do you love me
everybody is talking bout they know me
but they aint down like my motherfucking homies

and we can get it on biatch take it easy
dont try to hold me, control me
but you can take my number, baby call me when you lonely
cause its a mans world, aint no need to ask why
Im high till i die, and strapped with my 4-5

chorus x2

Tell me who do you love?

Maybe its the thug in me
