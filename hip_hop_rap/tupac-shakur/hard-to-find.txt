Tupac They say 
B-Legit Influenced by crime addicted to grinding 
C-Bo Where I can pile up my chips 
Richie Rich And ni**as call me one timer 
Tupac Been Ballin' since my adolecsent years steady climbing 
E-40 Man, you muthaf**kas don't know nothing about no timing 

Tupac Thats right boy start that s**t off 

I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized 
Picutes of me in my final stage, You know Mama cried 
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted 
Like I know longer existed, mysteriously missing 
Although i'm world wide, baby I ain't hard to find 
Why I spend most of my time on California crime 
Watching for theiven 
I'm cautious, its like I'm barely breathing 
Putting a bullet in muthaf**kas 
give me a reason 
See me and hope i'm intoxicated 
Looks like we faded 
You tried to play me 
Now homicide is my only payment 
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead 
Why the f**k you cowards be running, So scared to fire 'G' 
For the life of me, I cannot see 
How mutha-f**kas picture living life after a night 
Of f**king around with me 
And if you don't like this rhyme 
Then bring you big bad a*s to California 
Cuz we ain't hard to find

E-40 Man, you muthaf**kas don't know nothing about no timing 

I got my locs on 
Hard hat 
Going to war 
Breaking them off on sight 
Stopping lives on red lights 
Watch 'em pause as I pull out my strap out my drawers 
And get the dumping on their a*s like the last outlaws 
Rich, Tupac and the Cliq smoking blunts and loading clips 
With enough s**t to raise your block in one dip 
We bring on horror like tales from the crypt 
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick 

I'm fully automatic full of static and s**t 
Moving dodge van 
Fifty rounds in the clip 
I'm riding shot gun with the tint in the back 
I'm planning on having a mutha-f**kin' mit in this rap 
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where selling narcotics is all I know 
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever your kind 
And if you need a mutha-f**ka I ain't hard to find 

Some may call me hoopsy, but I call it timin' 
That's why I keeps on grinding 
To a point where a ni**a can't stop 
To much feelin' this s**t thats why I'm quick to peel a bi**h 
Whether its a ni**a or a ho a ho 
Get in my way then that a*s gots to go 
Cuz a ni**a steady plotting 
I serves hit for hit 
And mutha-f**kas keep dropping

E-40 Man, you muthaf**kas don't know nothing about no timing 

Down the steps 
Abandonded broken down apartment complex 
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary 
Playboy, what the f**k is the proof without the drama play 
ni**a, what the f**k you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate 
Best shake and bake although my was first to ask ni**as 
Mutha-f**kas thought I wasn't going do something ask ni**as 
Threatin' your life, it ain't like you love 'em 
Bury your thoughts, take his head f**kin' half ready 

I grew up with that ni**a, threw up with that ni**a 
I hear he trying to ride the legend for the other side 
But now my glock be so judgemental 
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental 
ni**a, if your gum bleedin' and you needin' more than 20 sticthes 
You behave like them bi**hes 
Side ways to the next 
Heavy in the game 
Check the resident 
It's all the same 
ni**a and we ain't hard to find 

Why them ni**as acting like they can't find like like they can't see us 
and like we don't be at the same spots that they be at...
