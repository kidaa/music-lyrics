I see no Changes, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Give the %! to da kids who da hell cares
One less hungry mouth on a welfare
First ship 'em dope let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns step back let 'em kill each other
Time to fight back thats what Huey said
2 shots in the dark now Hueys dead
I got luv for my brothers 
But we could never go no where 'less we share with eachother
We need to make some Changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And dats how its supposed to be
How could I ever take a brother if he's close to me,  uh
I love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and thats the way it is


[Chorus]x2
Thats just the way it is...
Things will never be the same....
Thats just the way it is...

Ahhh yeah



I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this 
one better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skills to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but stayin' in da dope game
Tell me whats a mother to do being real don't appeal to da brother in you
Ya gotta operate the easy way
[I made a G today]
But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' dope to the kids
[I gotta get paid]
Well hey, that way it is


[Chorus]x2


[2Pac Talking]
We need to make some Changes
We need to change the way we eat, the way we live and the way we treat
eachother
See, the old way wasn't workin, so its on us to do what we gotta do
to survive


Still I see no Changes, can't a brother a little peace
There's war on the streets and the war on the Middle East
Instead of a war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
I ain't never did no crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back on the track givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you, back you up
smack you up and pimp slap you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
I tell the cops can't touch this I don't trust this
when they try to rush I bust this
Sound on the 2, they say it ain't cool 
My momma didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
and never get to laid back
I always gotta worry about the payback
>From some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
Ratta-tat-tat-tat-tat
And thats the way it is

[Chorus]
