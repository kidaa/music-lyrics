pac talking:
"i wanted to bring back that reality, but nobody can ever be confused and think I'm
fuckin Mike Tyson and im a heavyweight champion, im a little nigga, thats why its so
raw to just watch me just battle lions, cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin'
niggas three times my size"


watch this uppercut, here it come... watch the jab nigga.. ugh

here it come, look out, watch my arms

Verse 1 - 2pac

Lets see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
comin' equipped with some shit niggas just cant believe
i pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikazee
i'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
my middle finger to you hoe niggas
run up on me, and ill be forced to let it go nigga
i aint the one you wanna try, why, stayin high
i hit the blunt an watch these motherfuckers die
whose runnin the streets i sell that cocaine
cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come raid your ass
now you stressed doin' fed time, and its a bitch
cause the judge gave you 8 years, you doin 6
and we know that you can't hang, you a trick
rolled over turned snitch like a biatchhhh


Chorus x1
now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so whats up nigga

now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so whats up nigga


Verse 2 - 2pac

They got a nigga in the dice game, i'm feelin' lucky
but the nigga's just a little bigger, he tryna fuck me
out my cash, imma blast nigga, he don't know
i gotta tell ya like the last nigga, gotta go
No need to run for the trunk, i get em' up
left or right, my uppercut'll hit em' up ha
i'm known to walk the streets on any block
i love my niggas, but i aint puttin down my glock
the gun shots rang when i lose nigga, and ooh nigga
imma show you not to ever play a true nigga haha
lay it down just to prove it
and fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this

Chorus x1


Verse 3 - Outlawz EDI & Young Noble

They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
this revolution wont be televised, we keep it silent shh
roll on our enemies, beat em' at they own game
molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
wanna see my kids grow dont know if imma make it though
one more nigga came up short in the ghetto
society lied to me so im strapped with the metal
push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
have ya face down goin in ya pockets if ya let em
i done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em
i done made so many mistakes but still i dont regret em
im a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
im a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
we all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven


Chorus x1

Edi talking:
"to all the comrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
'til we get up there with ya'll, YOU KNOW!..Thug Life we still livin it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go! woo"
