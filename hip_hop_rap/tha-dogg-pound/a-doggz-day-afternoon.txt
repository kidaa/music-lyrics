INTRO:DAZ
Yeah!Straight up 9-5!
Kurupt the motherfuckin Kingpin,Dat Nigga Daz
Creepin and crawlin through your hood,smokin,loccin
Provokin punk motherfuckers like this stuff.Wuz happenin?

KURUPT
In the dead of winter is when I kick my coldest phrases
Mentalest telepathy,lyrically it amazes
Constructioning thoughts that's as lethal as turpentine
An expert when I flex rhymes feared like ex-cons
In my zonezoneyou can't even find like Atlantis
Stalk like a prayin mantis,leavin battered bodies on the canvas
The burial ground for clowns,open casket
Trackin niggas down like fuckin basset hounds
Tragic how the mic gets handled
Prodigious like a vandal on a midnight scandal
The scramble like Randall abusive when I recite on the stage
Double access with a brand new motherfuckin mic

DAT NIGGA DAZ
Can I grab the microphone and spit some shit that's known
To blow the mind of Michelangelo's poems
For rusty motherfuckers to be acting like they all in
With the click got checks that shit
And once again it's on and it's on with the gangsta shit
I create the beats that beats the fucks right outta ya speakers
?Am so blown,shown for lootin?grab the microphone alone
Like Jodeci,notice-see ya self needs help
The homie style got the strap on deck
Don't neglect the fact I can make you or break youBreak you
Awake you to a new plateau wit' mo' hoes
Now the paper is made,now don't think twice
Niggas is gettin pimped because their game ain't tight
Now well wellwell, ?? where the ballers dwell
Another day,another dollar,Blueberry to sell
I makes that fast cash,hmm Dat Nigga Daz
?I'm quicker ta out slick ya?blast in half

KURUPT
DPG-eliminates the whole area beyond the thought dismemberin
Motherfuck surrenderin.Who,what,when,let's tear shit the fuck up
The homies coolin while you an' ya chest get fuckin blue an'
Provoke us,survey with the superior focus
I'm that nigga like Daz,crooked as scoliosis
S'impossible to survive on my arrival when I arrive
It's left to ya instict of survival
Mashin,cashing in chips I gotta loose sadistic sick mind
You define it I'm mentally silly and batter
It doesn't matter when ya into it
Ya just entered in a war-zone all alone with ya microphone unguarded
I just started poetical poltergeist precise and cold-hearted
Empty,tempt me,simply ya get shot
Ya forgot I'm down to empty out my clip on ya block
Stop let the whole place evacuate
wait until we're face-to-face then it escalates
Duck-down,Kurupt clowns niggas daily,hos can't play me
Observe I serve those that betray me

NATE DOGG
I ain't never seen a joint that I couldn't light
And I ain't never seen a buster that didn't fight 
I ain't never seen a G that would go for that
Especially when he knows Tha Dogg Pound got his back
I ain't never seen a game that did multiply
We gettin kinda deep,yeah the crew'll die

KURUPT:And who am I?
SNOOP DOGG:And who am I?
                         That crazy motherfucker from the DPG
                         Do or die!
