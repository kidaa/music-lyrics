Impossible 
For a plain yellow pumpkin to become a golden carriage 
Impossible 
For a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in marriage 
And four white mice could never be turned to horses 
Such falder-all-and-fiddle-dee-dee of course is 
Impossible 
But the world is full of zanies and fools 
Who don't believe in sensible rules 
And don't believe what sensible people say 
And because these daft and dewey-eyed dopes 
Keep building up impossible hopes, 
Impossible things are happening everyday. 
Impossible

Impossible 
Impossible! 
It's possible, for a plain yellow pumpkin and a prince to join in 
marriage 
Quite possible, for a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in marriage 
And four white mice are easily turned to horses 
Such falder-all-and-fiddle-dee-dee of course is 
Quite possible! 
For the world is full of zanies and fools 
Who don't believe in sensible rules 
And don't believe what sensible people say 
And because these daft and dewy-eyed dopes 
Keep building up impossible hopes, 
Impossible things are happening everyday. 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible!
