words and lyrics by: Rodgers   Hammerstein 

Stepsister It looks that way 
Stepsister The way you say 
Stepmother She talks as if she knows 
Brandy I do not know that this is so 
I only just suppose 

I suppose it when you come into the ballroom 
and the room its self is floating in the air 
and if your suddenly confronted by his highness 
you are frozen like a statue on the stairs 
you are afraid he'll hear the way your heart is 
beating and you know you mustn't make the first 
advance you are seriously thinking of retreating 
then you see to hear him asking you to dance 

A lovely night 
A lovely night 
A finer night you know you'll never see. 
You meet your prince 
Your charming prince 
As charming as a prince will ever be 
The stars in a hazy heaven tremble above you 
While he's whispering darling I LOVE YOU 
You say goodbye 
Away you fly 
But on your lips you keep a kiss 
All your life you'll dream of this 
Lovely, lovely night.
