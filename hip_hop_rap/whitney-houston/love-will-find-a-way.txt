Each time I pray 
I search for words that say all that I'm going through 

Here's what to say each time you pray 
I give it all to you 
How can I know what's real 

Oh trust in yourself believe in what you feel 

I don't understand what's the Master plan 
will it ever come together? 
Yes love will find the way 
Open up your heart 
Give the greater part 

And it will 
Yes it will 
Oh Yes it will 
Love will find a way 

Its all a part of youth 
searching for the truth 
seeing the way roads will lead you 

Now I realize though problems may arise 
There's someone I can come to 

Time waits for no man 
Don't give up 
It's time to take a stand 

I don't understand what's the Master plan 
Will it ever come together? 
Yes love will find the way 
Open up your heart 
Give the greater part 
And it will 
Yes it will 

Love will find the way 

In the middle of the night 
Love will lead you to the light 
You can win [Oh yes you can] 
Just hold on 
Don't give up the fight [Don't give up the fight] 
love will make things right 

You can win 
You can win 
You can win 
You can win 
You can win 

Now I understand {I know that] 
Love will find the way 

Open up your heart 
Give the greater part 
And it will come together 
Love will find a way 
Now I understand 
This is the master plan 

Yes it is 
Yes it is 

Love wil find a way 

I do believe 
I do I do I do I do 

Now you know love will find a way 
Love will find a way 

I know it will 
Just believe it 
I do believe it 

Love will find a way
