If there's a time when the fears should fill your eyes 
And you can't see past thge shadows 
To the sun on the other side 
Don't despair, vecause there always will be 
someone there 
Don't lose faith, love won't let you lose your way 
Because

You, you'll never stand alone 
I'll be standing by 
I'll keep you from the cold 
I'llhold you when you cry 
I'll be there to be strong 

When you can't find the strength inside 
And you, you'll always have a home 
In these arms of mine 
You'll never stand alone 
Love is standing by

If there's a dayt when the rain should find your heart 
And you're cold and tried and lonely 
And this would has you in the dark 
Don't be scared, you can just reach for me and I'll be there 
Don't lose hope, love will see you through you know 
Because

You, you'll never stand alone 
I'll be standing by 
I'll keep you from the cold 
I'llhold you when you cry

When you can't find the strength inside 
And you, you'll always have a home 
In these arms of mine

Standing by to life you above all the hurt and pain 
Standing by to carry you through all the tears and ain
