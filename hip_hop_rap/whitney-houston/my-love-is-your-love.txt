clap your hands, yall its alright....

If tomorrow is judgement day sing mommy
And I'm standin' on the front line
And the Lord ask me what I did w/ my life
I will say I spent it withyou

If I wake up in WW 3
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if youcommin' with me

Cause your love is my love 
and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couln't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me

As the years they pass us by
we stay young through eachother's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you babe

[chorus]

If I should die this very day
Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what people day
I'll be waiting for you after jusdement day

[chorus]
