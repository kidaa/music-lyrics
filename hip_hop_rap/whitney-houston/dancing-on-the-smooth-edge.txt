Boy, you drive me crazy 
You sure got a lot of nerve 
The way you take your sweet time 
All around me like your work of art 
Who said you know me so good 
You're a dangerous angel 
Should have seen right from the start 
Still I'd never change you 
Anyway? 

Chorus 1: 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 2x 
Hearts on fire 
Filled with desire 
And I'm waiting for the words you say 
On the smooth edge 2x 

So funny how the night just slips on by 
In a long slow dance with you 
Crazy how you keep on leading me boy 
To a place beyond taboo 
You're a cool persuader 
Hey don't you have no shame 
Still I'm gonna take you 
Anyway?


Chorus 2: 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 2x 
Hearts on fire 
Filled with desire 
And I'm reaching for your every move 
Dancin on the smooth edge 
On the smooth edge 
Smooth edge, smooth edge 
Oh, oh you're an angel, yes you are 

Chorus 3: 
You've got me dancin on the smooth edge 2x 
Hearts on fire 
Filled with desire 
And I'm deeper, deeper in love with you 
Dancin on the smooth edge
