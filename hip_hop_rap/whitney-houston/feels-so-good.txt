VERSE 1 
You are the first, you'll be the last 
To hold me 
And from the time we met I knew you would be 
Cause when I'm with you 
My heart just beats so fast, so slowly 
I can't control myself because only you 

Can fulfill my every need 
Only you can save me 
And with you my heart is running free, babe 
Listen to me 

CHORUS 

Ooh...when you love me 
Feels so right, when you hug me 
Ooh...when you love me 
Feels so good 
Ooh...when you love me 
Feels so right, when you hug me 
Ooh...when you love me 
Feels so good 

VERSE 2 

I've never been in love before 
Until now 
And anything you know 
Won't you show me how 
Because I want and need your love, so dearly 
And it's my strongest prayer to make you see that 

Can fulfill my every need 
Only you can save me 
And with you my heart is running free, babe 
Listen to me 

CHORUS repeat till end
