This one's for you 
 Curtis, I love you 
If you look into your heart 
 With a positive mind 
 Take some inventory of your woman and your glory 
 Leave the bad things behind [ooh] 

Everybody's got a story [yes they do] 
 About love and the good things 
 But all the spices of your life 
 You just got to pay the price 
 If you know what I mean [ooh yeah] 

I'm telling everybody 
 I know how a girl becomes so proud 
 When I finally found there was nothing left 
 I said I do believe I found myself 
 And I want to give it to you baby oh yes I do [yeah yeah] 

So if you look into your heart 
 With a positive mind 
 You can take some inventory of your woman and your glory 
 Leave the bad things behind 

I know my man really loves me we don't have that every day [oh no no no] 
 I know my man really needs me I say it 
 What ever he wanna do I wanna do it with you baby [yeah yeah] 

Jump on the night Love's not an easy game 
 And he's strong and he's straight 
 Now that I see 
 What he's giving me 
 I say what ever he wanna do I wanna do it with you baby 

I'm loving you more and more and more and more 
 And giving you all and all of me 
 I say now mercy baby 
 I'm loving you more and more and more and more 
 I'm giving you all and all of me 
 Oh yes I am 
 Say mercy baby 
 I'm loving you more 
 Mercy baby 
 Mercy baby 
 Mercy baby
