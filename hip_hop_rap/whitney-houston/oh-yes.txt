The day you held me in your arms 
I still smell da scent of you 
On my dress unbelievable 
And you was so masculine 
The way I felt youir chest up next to mine 
I fell you in my heart 
Now I breathe love
You are so amazing 
Unbelievable baby 
It's you that make me smile 
When everything gets crazy 
And you the one I love 
No other man can faze me 
Cause you're in my heart 
Every minute, daily
The time you looked into my eyes 
I felt like falling in love 
And I was mesmerized 
Cause it's something you do 
That makes me feel thuis way
I can't explain 
You're my joy peace and happiness 
And you...
You are so amazing 
Unbelievable baby 
It's you that make me smile 
When everything gets crazy 
And you the one I love 
No other man can faze me 
Cause you're in my heart 
Every minute, daily
