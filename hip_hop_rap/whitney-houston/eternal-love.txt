Something's wrong 
I don't understand 
The way I feel 
I don't know just where I am 
There is some mistake 
What am I doing here 
Away from you 
Where I belong 

It isn't fair 
Keeping us apart 
And in return 
I'm left with just my broken heart 
I close my eyes 
I feel you close to me 
I'm in your arms 
Where I belong 

Eternal Love 
Is all that I have to give 
It's only for you I live 
You're all that I've got 
Just say you love me 
And that no one else 
Can ever make you feel the same 

Something's wrong 
I just don't understand 
I've never felt this way 
For any other man 
My only dream 
My one reality 
My pledge to you 
Eternal Love [Eternal love, Eternal love, Eternal love....] 
All that I give you is 
All that I have 
Oh baby take me in your arms [I remember, I remember, I hear you call my name] 

Just say you love me 
And that no one else 
Can ever make you feel the same [Oh no, Oh no, Oh no] 
No one loves you like I love you 
No one loves you like I do 

It's just not fair 
You can't keep me away 
Cause I won't give you up 
I've got to get you back today 
My only dream 
My one reality 
My pledge to you 
Eternal Love  [Eternal love, Eternal love, Eternal love....] 

[Eternal love... Eternal love... Eternal love....] 

Eternal Love Sweet Baby 
[Nobody loves you like I love you] Nobody loves you like I love you 
[Nobody loves you like I do] Nobody loves you like I love you 
[Nobody loves you like I love you] Nobody loves you like I love you 
[Nobody loves you like I do] Nobody Baby 

Eternal Love....Eternal Love...Baby 

Eternal Love...
