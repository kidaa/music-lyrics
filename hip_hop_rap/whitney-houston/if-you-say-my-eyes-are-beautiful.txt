If you say my eyes are beautiful 
It's because they're looking at you 
And if you could only see yourself 
You'd feel the same way too 
You could say that I am a dreamer 
Who's had a dream come true 
If you say my eyes are beautiful 
It's because they're looking at you 

If you wonder why I'm smiling 
It's because I'm happy with you 
And the warm sensations touch my heart 
And fill me through and through 
I could hold you close forever 
And never let you go 
If you say my eyes are beautiful 
It's because I just love you so 

Now, my heart is an open door 
Won't you come inside for more 
You give love so sweetly now 
Take my love take me completely now 
If you say my eyes are beautiful 
It's because they're looking at you 
And my eyes are just the window 
For my feelings to come through 
And by far you are more beautiful 
Than anything I ever knew 
If you say my eyes are beautiful 
If you say my eyes are beautiful 
If you say my eyes my eyes are beautiful 

It's because, It's because, they're looking at you
