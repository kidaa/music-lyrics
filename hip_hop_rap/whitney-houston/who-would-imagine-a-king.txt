Mommies and Daddies always believe 
That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king

A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king

It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing Your name
That the world would be different coz you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon He would bring something special to me
And all of the wonderful gifts He could bring
Who would imagine
Who could imagine
Who would imagine a king
