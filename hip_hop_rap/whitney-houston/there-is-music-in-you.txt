words and lyrics by: Rodgers   Hammerstein 

Impossible things are happening everyday... 

Someone wants you 
You know who 
Now you're living 
There's music in you 

Now you'll hear 
Something new 
Someone's playing 
The music in you 

Now you're living 
You know why 
Now there's nothing 
You won't try 

Move a mountain 
Light the sky 
Make a wish come true 
There is music in you 

Now you can go where ever you want to go 
Now you can do whatever you want to do 
Now you can be whatever you want to be 
And love is a song you will sing your whole life through 

Move a mountain 
Light the sky 
Make a wish come true 
There is music in you 

In you
