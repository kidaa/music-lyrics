Verse One: Erick Sermon
I make a million buck
every six months and y'all
hating my game, saying my name, they call
me the E, wrong things
knowing Im fly without wings
while some of y'all have to pull strings.
In this era I maintain the freak upon the beats
master basslines of Raphael Saadiq
Lyrical mastermind, a genius so dont snooze
no missions impossible, ask Tom Cruise
I keep a joint lit, when I have to spit
I rough paragraph, laugh when I'm busting yo' ass, who want it?
Come and see me, like 112
and I'll rock that bell with Fox and L
E-Dub, Mr Excitement, right
The poltergeist of rap so come to the light.
Yes, the recipient of this award goes to Moi,
the best qualified superstar.
Chorus: EPMD
Erick:  My squad stays on point like
        Den en den den de den, It's the joint
Parish: Yeah my squad stay on point like,
Erick:  Den en den den de den, Its the joint.

Verse Two: Parrish Smith
Its the joint, stay on point
Plus I'm feelin it
niggas killin shit tryin to duplicat the manuscript
thats impossible, pray like the gospel
over coming set backs, and jumping over obstacles
Like Evil Kenevil, on point like a needle
EPMDs' like the Beatles, back with another sequal
to hip hop, check one two and you don't stop
rap with mainstream R&B; and pop
now the worlds shocked
the E-doubles back with Mic-Doc
Like it or not we bout to turn it up another notch
My speeds put it down for my seeds
Raw breeds, acres with the deeds, its the joint.
Chorus: first part the same

I got millions of chips, and they stack like that
A five year spread, and now we back like that
How dare they, niggas sittin in they room with Brandy
way pissed off thikin how the can't stand me
He rhyme Shawn for his Penn, talking

P:  You know me, from rippin shows wit my homie
