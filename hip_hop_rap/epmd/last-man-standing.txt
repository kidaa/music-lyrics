The year is 2000. All the real motherfuckers left
PMD, Def Squad & Hit Squad and the virus
I'll tell you who I be check it
Erick Sermon:
This is Erick Sermon, one of God's children of billions
With more Hype than Williams 
Maintain millions so when the world get close to ending
My squad prepare for squad spending, I ain't begot no weapon
I'm lyin, get caught off guard I'm firin
Until I hear sirens, I'm Gone With The Wind
A black Clark Gable, doin 90 in the Lexus sport a fat cable
Never hold nothing back, I get the stress of my chest
Fell this so all the envious hear this
I catch wreck any punk in my way I'm banded Why E?
Cause I'm the last man standin
Hook:
";Whatever it takes how ever it gots to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound";
	--> P of Mobb Deep: Hell On Earth
Last man standing 2X
PMD:
Yeah, yo snap that neck, not playing with a full deck
Make a nigga sweat below the waist line by my johnson
Where my tools kept, who I be? The code name PMD
Causialty to an MC who try to fuck wiht P, or E-Dub
Catch the burner with the snub, no love
A tight defence, like the glove, so bring it
Any song we drop I bet you sing it
Check the logo and slip up and get creamed kid
My pen is registered like Bruce Lee on loose leaf
My crew be, timped down puffing looseys
Drop the slick shit, nigga wanna get with
Swiss Smith, street cat strap ?
Hook 2X
Erick Sermon:
Black the Ripper, by barracks, cold like anemic
Believe it, it takes years for y'all to achieve it
Cause I'm a go getter, I get the loot, I get the cash
The blunt, the weed, the hash
and then white with my friends in the Benz
Smoke fill the car until I blind my lens
I lock down my statis, I be the baddest
Yes the one that get you open the most outspoken
PMD:
Shogun assassin, chinesse connection, ninja maskin
We turnin to gravity, B-boy with the pants saggin
Ain't no stoppin, on the case like Johnny Cochran
The beats knockin, mock speed is what I'm clockin
With Erick Serm, mess with fire you get burned
Like a bad perm it's the return that niggas yearn
What, PMD and the bandit, never stranded
Bust a canon, cause it's the last man standin
Hook 2X
