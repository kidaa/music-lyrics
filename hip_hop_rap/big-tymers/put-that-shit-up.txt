feat. Lac, Mikkey, and Stone

[Baby talking]
Um hmm:fo sho
You can do big thangs when you're the Big Tymers
And even if you ain't nigga just keep grindin' nigga
You really don't have to have golf balls you can have pimples
Ya know Just have your game on

[Chorus Lac + Mannie Fresh]
[Lac:] If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
[Mannie:] Oh 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
[Lac:] If you ride with an ugly chick than put that bitch in
[Mannie:] Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
[Lac:] If your diamonds ain't shining up that put that shit up
[Mannie:] 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
[Lac:] Cutlass to the Benz, Monte Carlo, and Prowler
[Mannie:] DVD to the TV that mean you can HOLLA!

[Baby]
Check out the Benz 
Bought a green diamond - 30 carrots for stuntin'
I'm the boss of your ghetto, black crow of this game
Slide me 200 G's and I'll do anything
I'm gonna live it up and all
Mom how your son is known to ball
I put 22's on everything I car
The Jag, the Bentley, Rolls-Royce, the house hold
Hung out with Bobby - Ate breakfast with Whitney
Made it official New York is my city nigga
Got a trophy from the game ya'll know my name
Baby - Number one stunna, caught showing my thang
Got a house on the lake I built from cake
Cooking pies and hustling for  flakes
I put dub deuces on the Avalanche truck
I break bruises I don't give a fuck

[Chorus Lac + Mannie Fresh]
[Lac:] If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
[Mannie:] 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
[Lac:] If you ride with an ugly chick than put that bitch in
[Mannie:] Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
[Lac:] If your diamonds ain't shining that put that shit up

[Stone]
Say there's some 22's that cost a half-a-mill
When me and Baby be coming through like ya'll rappers for real
Now I be slinging blocks, totting two twin glocks
Pushing a 600 Benz, rims spin when I stop
Jock, it's alright you see the watch ya'll like
I just got the  with the frog lights
Than it's alright kit it with a chrome small pipe
With killer Stone on the left and Hot Boys on right

[Lac]
Nigga I be riding in some Z71 type shit
Limo tinted cause I'm creeping with a fine bright bitch
Aston Martin got a new thing that I just might get
And if Puffy give a party he invite my clique
We gone pop that shit, say wodie where the bottles at
Hello, this is a stunting bitch holla back
Princess and baguettes to out shine you cock suckers
Riding on some Ferris wheel's - Bigger than a mother fucker!

[Chorus Lac + Mannie Fresh]
[Lac:] If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
[Mannie:] 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
[Lac:] If you ride with an ugly chick than put that bitch in
[Mannie:] Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
[Lac:] If your diamonds ain't shining that put that shit up
[Mannie:] 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up

[Mannie Fresh]
Rims - 22, chick - 22, take about 22
Playboy, now who the fuck are you
I'm mister two-door coupes
Is that the cracker-gator boots
With the two piece Gucci suits
2-way hanging off the loops
Gazigga-zan, gazigga-zigga-zigga-zan
Give me the watch, the bracelet and the chain
Fuck your Bentley - too slow ya heard
Lamborghini in first "clock, clock unnn unnn skkkkiiirrrrr!"

[Mikkey]
You know Mikkey play the Air Ones - loosely laced
So I might lose a shoe when the groupies chase
The group be straight - the truth be I prefer the range
The sex be great but I prefer the brains
We got Dollars by the millions
Shoppers by the buildings
Chances of falling off - slim like Robin Williams
You can find me changing lanes in the Aston
Leaning back with your dame laughing haha

[Chorus Lac + Mannie Fresh]
[Lac:] If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
[Mannie:] 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
[Lac:] If you ride with an ugly chick than put that bitch in
