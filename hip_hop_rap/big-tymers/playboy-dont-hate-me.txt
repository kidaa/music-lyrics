[Lil' Wayne]
What, what   what, what, huh
Huh, huh, Big Tymers, huh
Better act like you know it
I be comin wit' it
And you saw Wayne from a distance in the Expedition
I'm on chrome, 20 inches you know who I be
Oh yes, you know me
4 feet, millionaire, that's H-O-T
Whoa-ty, slow down, you might be a hater
Slippin' 'tal in your drawers, Hot Boy
Get up, Cardion, lobster regular
And you can call me on   my cell-ular, what
Celebrate and pop the Don P
Beep, that's me that drop the funk beat, uh uh
Me and Lil' Travis stun'n hard off 'less my daddy grab it
I got a Roley on my wrist with 10 karats
And I'ma shine but I'm still bout blastin', huh
Nigga rollin' short about paper
Bedroom, 2nd floor, in the 'vator
I'm a superstar star, money makin' pimp
Up in the double R R, just me and Slim
I'm getting cheesed by the milk stackin' cake, boy
Cash Money, how you luv that, playboy playboy

Don't hate me, baby cause I'm beautiful [3x]
How you luv that, playboy

[Verse 2]
We go lights, action, camera
We here to hammer ya
Go ask Pamela or your baby momma Lil' Tamera
Feel like a samurai or Zorro
Rich niggas don't borrow
Cut a check or wait til the bank open tomorrow
Look at ya sorrow, ends gotta meet, kids gotta eat
While we make a meal, rhymin' in and out of beat
Am I to see shit Don't even look for it, it's way off
Concerts sellin' out like Chicago Bulls playoffs
So stay off the ground cause it's dangerous, whoa-ty
Too many riches, these bitches don't, won't hang with us, whoa-ty
It's a gang of us, whoa-ty
You see one everywhere you go, ain't no thang with us, whoa-ty
You get it either it show
We go to the bank so much, bitch, we got a bedroom
With hoes countin' money and giving niggas head, room
So when you hear the leg boom, bitch you better get somewhere
Somebody gettin' hit somewhere, butt on the run, startin' shit somewhere,
playboy

[Chorus]
Don't hate me, baby cause I'm beautiful
These flashy cars ain't new to y'all
Don't hate me, baby cause I'm beauiful
These flasy cars ain't new to y'all, playboy

[Verse 3]
I got these niggas takling about this black-on-black Hummer
I scored that last summer
But this year playboy, I'm gonna stretch that motherfucker
I bought a Yukon for my main bitch with my newborn
Pictures of other ol' ladies suckin' on my dick
While you be loving the stupid bitch
Now I guess I been playing with about 10 million and something
These hoes been giving me they pussy like it ain't nothing
Going to the club with 10 G's and a bar tab that's all on Baby
Lettin' these hoes and niggas drank for free
Playgirl but you gotta understand one thang, that shit all on Cash Money
Well here's another case, where this hoe sprayed Mace in my face
Cause I wouldnt give this hoe no plate
Tellin' me I think my shit dont stank cause I got a Benz, a Hummer, a Lexus
And a penthouse that say "Hoe Hater"
With tatoos with number one stunner
With billionaire on my left arm, and millionaire on my right arm
Bitches be lovin' this gold grill, homey
I spent 20 G's on my earrings, homey
Nigga, I aiin't met a nigga who could drop a beat like Fresh
And I ain't met a nigga that could out shine me
See I gotta clip that called pussy-go getters
Now playboy, these hoes be lovin' these Cash Money niggas

[Chorus then talk til the end]
