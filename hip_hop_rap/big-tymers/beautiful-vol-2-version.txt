[Mannie]
Now I'm feelin good and fine
Smokin green and drinkin wine
Ten thousand dollars at the bar all on Baby
I guess this makes me a super-duper star
Drinkin ripple and tanquerae
A brand new drink, I call it ripple-rae

[Chorus 2x]
My life is beautiful
Livin that good life
It's just beautiful
Livin that good life

[Mannie]
Baby take me to the motel
When we finished you can go tell
Teresa, Lisa, and Dawn
How we got butt-naked and go it on
How I split ya, hit ya and brung ya home
Stole ya chains and rings and herenbone

[Chorus]

[Mannie]
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These fancy cars aint new to ya'll
Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These fancy cars aint new to ya'll

[Spoken]
How you love that 1998
That's Big Tymer style
There's a lot of these niggas baller blockin
Standin in the way
Cause I'm gon' shine
All the time
How you love that yeah
On the bass
Funky Fingaz, can I get a wodie
On the keys, just wodie wooday
Just wodie wooday
Big wodie wooday
Take it to the bridge, take it to the bridge

[Bridge 2x]
Just rollerskate, rollerskate
Don't player hate, player hate

[Chorus]

[Spoken]
This here is platinum material
Just light, light-weight interlude
How you luv that
It's gorgeous out chea
I'm a neighborhood superstar
I'd rather be young rich and local
Than nation-wide and broke, bro
All the time all the time
All the time
Ya'll can say what you want about me
I got this man
Drinks is on me
Everybody order somethin, drinks on me
Everything on me Moet, Moet
I love myself
I love myself, I love myself
Shouts out to the whole city
The broads alright, but the niggas pretty
