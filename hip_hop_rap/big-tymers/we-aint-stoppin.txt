feat. Hot Boys

[Lil' Wayne]
Whoa, whoa
The Big Tymers nigga, who, who
Big Tymers nigga, huh, get it right

[Juvenile]
Bentley interior I lay back on it, 
everytime a nigga see me it's a Kodak moment
Now I ain't the one to brag nope
But I bought myself a hummer, my brother a Jag for sho
I'm taking all the ho's and I'm making you mad yep
You violate my household, I'm busting your ass
Is you listening, do you see my ice when it's glistening
Cause if you wit that balla blocking niggas come up missing then

[Lil' Wayne]
I need a bin life, to get right, up in my new Prowler
And put her lips tight on this pipe and suck out the problem
Need a Rolex wit princess cuts all at the bottom
Need a kit wit twenty inches on the car that I'm driving
Went from dimes to quakes, to money like Bill Gates
Doing a hundred on interstates, and Hummers on 38's
We are C.M.B. my nigga
Fresh, Baby, Hotboys and Weezy Wee my nigga

[Chorus: B.G.]
Where ever it's popping, we stopping
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Where ever it's twerking, we working
She got to be slurping, for certain

[Turk]
Project and hoodrat bitch is who I like
A bitch that's about riding, who going on flight

[Mannie Fresh]
I met this bitch in Cabriny Green, a nasty ho
Like that dick from the back and you can "ugh" in her throat

[Turk]
A bitch that's about hustling and smuggling work
Head busting and thugging, just like Turk

[Mannie Fresh]
A wild bitch off Gray street, doing her thing
Big ass, big tits she love eat ding-a-ling

[Turk]
I need a black hoe
One wit the braids in her head
Working wit some ass
And can give good head

[Mannie Fresh]
Can't forget about this bitch up in Philly and Richie Allen
A freak nasty bitch, that's always swallow

[Turk]
Sticking to tha G code, Ree's and Girbaud's
Got hands and bout strapping, quick to beat a ho

[Mannie Fresh]
Oops, almost forgot about Tasha up in the Watts
A hotgirl for sho, that stay dropping it like it's hot

Chorus: [B.G.]
Where ever it's popping, we stopping
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Where ever it's twerking, we working
She got to be slurping, that's for certain

[Baby]
Bitch, I'ma be stunting until the day I go what
Bentley's and Hummers and drop Diablo's what
Running wit nigga's that don't love no ho's what
Platinum grill cause bitch I'm done wit gold

[Lil' Wayne]
Hey
Now you know it's lil Weezy off the heezy believe me whoa
Hot like pepper, sliding out the compressor slow
Me and your wife slut, don't slam my door
Cut on the lights, look how the dam watch glow

[Baby]
Hold up, Wayne what
You know what, Wayne whoa

[Lil' Wayne]

You gonna make me go buy a grape Hummer
And make me put my name in diamonds on the license plate cousin

[Baby]

[Lil' Wayne]
Nigga you know it's Iceberg boy straight off the block
Wit the number one stunner and we blazing hot

[Chorus: B.G.]
Where ever it's popping, we stopping
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Where ever it's twerking, we working
She got to be slurping, that's for certain

Where ever it's popping, we stopping
But if it ain't hot then, we not then
Where ever it's twerking, we working
She got to be slurping, that's for certain
