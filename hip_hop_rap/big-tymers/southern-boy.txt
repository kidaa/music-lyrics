I'm a push trucks, nigga I'm a drive Benz,
Muthafuck the 8's nigga I'ma get the 10's,
I'ma drink everything, I'ma get drunk,
Watch the shoes, I'ma show ya dudes, I'm bout to pop the trunk,
I'ma be captivator, I'ma be calm,
Hat to the shirt, to the pants playa WOAH,
I'ma play Polo, I'ma stay rich, 
I'm about to bust the southside in this bitch,
I'm a stay with sprint, mutha fuck Nextel,

I'ma eat chicken player, Ima sip lak,
And push the old school Caddy with the Diamond in the Back,
I'ma get the candy paint just because I know you can't,
Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, your life is blank,
I'ma get the new J smoke all the purple haze,
I'ma stick with game spittin', game spittin' in your face,

Look we ride the biggest truck,
20 inches don't give a fuck,
When I roll, nigga know I'm plush
Coming round' and I'm high as fuck,
Green truck, lift up, spinning blades is a must,
Wood grain, suede and leather, feeling good with this Cali weather,
I can go in any hood, get a nigga they know I could,
Coming round and I'm iced up too,
Nigga know bout me and my crew,
Laying low, being cool,
Smoking weed, is what we do,
Moving Ki's, bought that coupe,
Stacking G's is what we do,
Nigga know that I'm slanging that iron,
Fuck around trying to take my shine,
Nigga know that I'm bout getting mine,
Hustling, flippin when I'm on that grind,
Nigga know we got work uptown,
Fuck around and we shut you down,
Pussy, pussy pussy, you pussy pussy bitch..

[Chorus X2]

[Bun B]
I'm pumping thru the south holding my nuts,
I'm in my candy apple red cadillac car rolling them dutch,
White cuts with that stitch and tuck, looking for a bitch to fuck,
Find a slut lil fifty buck, look like you need this dick to suck,
I'm truck turner pimping, with Issac Hayes roll on, 
Just another pimp getting his stroll on bitch hold on,
You staring at a pimp, trying to look him in his eyes, 
When You practice southballing, if you get broke don't be surprised,
Tell no lies about this macking, some win and some be loosing,
But pimping never dying cuz these hoes is steady choosing,
If you fucking with my paper, you cruising for a bruising,
So let there be no confusion, pimping ain't no illusion,
Don't believe me ask ?, she shorted my lil brother, she mutha fucking paged chose a pimp
like no other,
We all about that dollar bitch, so when you see a pimp don't try to holla, wipe me down and
pop my collar..

[Chorus X2]
