Have you ever seen the crocidile seats in the truck 
Turn around and sit it down and let em' bite ya butt
See, the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani,
With Your baby moma playa is where u can find me
Pushing through the parking lot on 24's Cadilac Escalade with the chromed out nose
With the navivgation arrow headed straight to your spot
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, Start the 3 wheel benz
Hyper white lights, ultra violet lens
Suma tuma tires and they gotta be run flat
T.V. where the horn go, boy can you top that 
I'ma show you some shit when you press that button
The trunk went Eh-eh and all of a sudden
4 15's didnt see no wire's, and then i heard boom from the amplifiers

With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back
