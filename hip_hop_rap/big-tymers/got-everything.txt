[Baby Talking:]
Ay, Big Money Heavyweight, ay Fresh we back at it daddy, Big Tymers, summertime boy

[Verse 1 Baby]
See its summertime homie and we born to shine,
Cadillac dipped grill with the 9 on line,
Keep the ice on packed, with the big mack stacks,
Rims dipped the same colour as the new Cadillac,
See we lace our hoes, and smoke our dro'
When we go to the club, we go through the back door,
With the nine on my waistline waistline
Any nigga act up he get that nine to his fuckin' mind
Homie still doing time doing time, son a sack thru his mind
he get it thru the pipeline, 
flicks, so you see how we shine, everybody know stunna so you know I'm doing mines,
Its a vision of dreams with Cadillac machines, get loot, not hoes if you know what I mean
Gotta hustle and grind, keep the money on your mind,
Summertime all hoods, blow up and shine

[Chorus X2 Tateeze & Baby]
[Tateeze]
Got everything they ever built, everything they ever made
[Baby]
And on my bed, I even got a mink spread
[Tateeze]
On all my cars, gotta have spinning blades
[Baby]
And all my toys, gotta have an infared

[Verse 2 Mannie Fresh]
Six years ago, a friend of mine
Said its gon' rain before the sunshine,
Some gon' lead, some gon' follow,
Some gon' spit, some gon' swallow,
Now where you going ?, where you been ?
And whats your angle, and how you fit in,
So this time I made up my mind,
Fuck being broke, its time to shine,
Kiss my momma, tell my daddy I'm gone,
Baby boy on his way to make a song,
From a quarter to a dollar to a five to a ten
You are witnessing, 
The rise of a young black entrepreneur,
Spread my wings, I'm about to soar,
two million, three million nigga I did it,
two billion, three billion nigga lets get it,

[Chorus X2]

[Verse 3 Baby & Mannie Fresh]
[Baby]
See I'm a neighbourhood baller with the beamers and sprawlers,
The broads keep callin cuz baby I'm ballin'
Hood rich shit with these ghettos and bricks,
Stunna back at it ma' with that brand new six,
Stunna got that caddy with the bubble eye lips,
Fully equipped whips to custom made shit,
Now everything is wet, and everything is slick,
and everything is paid, mannie mink pimp
[Mannie Fresh]
You scared, get the new escalade, 
The long motherfucker get the head done in suede,
Shining at its best, nigga wear your vest,
Southern ass nigga with his shirts and jeans fresh,
I like them starched heavy, big box chevy,
Head till' I'm dead from my ol' girl Debbie,
Don't try it, buy it, if its factory, amplify it,
Might go nitro, ignite it,
