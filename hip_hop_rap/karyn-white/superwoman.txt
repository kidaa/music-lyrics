Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table,
and make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream...
Your eggs are overeasy, your toast unlikely,
all that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me...
Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet,
and I can't help but to wonder if you're talking about me...
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it's hurting so deep,
I've got my pride, I will not cry, but it's making me weak...

I'm not your superwoman...
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down,
and think that everything is okay...
Boy I am only human...
This girl needs more than occasional hugs 
as a token of love from you to me...

I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you...
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you...
But when you get there, you just tell me you're not hungry at all,
you said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk...
You like to think that I'm just crazy when I say that you've changed,
I'm convinced I know the problem, you don't love me the same...
You're just going through the motions and you're not being fair,
I've got my pride, I will not cry, still I can't help but care!!!

I'm not your superwoman...oh no no no!!!
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
and think that everything is okay...
Boy I am only human...I'm only human!!!
This girl needs more than occasional hugs 
as a token of love from you to me...

I'm not your superwoman...
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
and think that everything is okay...
Boy I am only human...
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
as a token of love from you to me...

Oooh, baby!!!
Look into the corners of your mind,
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times,
but I can't be the superwoman that you want me to be!!
I'll give my everlasting love if you'll return love to me!!
I'm not your superwoman!!!!

I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
and think that everything is okay...
Boy I am only human...
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
as a token of love from you to me...

Oh!!! If you feel it in your heart and you understand me,
stop right where you are, everybody sing along with me!
hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...
I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet,
but you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me!!!
I need love, I need just your love, I'm not your superwoman...
