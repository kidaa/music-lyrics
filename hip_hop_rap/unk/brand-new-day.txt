Nobody in they life thought I'd go this far 
My momma kept her face up so I persude as a star
Now when I say be real, my hope like now changed
It's money to the bank my lil girl got everythang
And now we movin up, like we seein George
I might of spent some shit, I used to cut a ford
And yes I rock it all, dedications to my dogs
And all my friends that stayed down with yo boy man this for ya'll
I let the people see how it can be done 
They watchin and soapin innerseptions so I run
Now stay up on yo grind, that's what the big man say
I told them is they vice, i'm shinnin everyday
Now they here my name like wait

Clap five times to my sound, DJ Montay on the beat DJ Montay on the beat

These niggas out here flexin, I told them they aint ready
Now what's the compatition, they square us just like frames
I barely here they songs I barely here they names
And I hold my head up high, Blowin kisses to the sky
R.I.P. Grandma Bell, love you grandma aint forgot
Nigga now the world's gon see, how it's supposed to go
If ten was at the table five had to go
And that's just how it go, I saved it for the game
We bruoght it to the game, Big go baby do yo thang
Got diamonds on my neck, the neck match the ill, the ill match the watch,
the watch match the gear
Now this will be my year, before we let them burn
Put that in yo blunt and smoke it, you live and you learn
Now yo straight like a perm, I'm so strong as a bell 
When my uncle walk come home we throwin 4's in the air throwin 4's everywere

You see I'm on a mission, success is how it happens
Yo boy is Fredrick Doug, I sue wassup whats happenin
Before there's fingers snappin, You see I pay my dues
Every flier that you seen, DJ UNK on one's and two's
2000 is my crew, that's just a lil bit of my past
You see if you put me on, Big gon find me at last
I'm biddin it's a blast, I met up with the camp
Now gon and bring it back, I got the heart of a champ
These niggas said they vets, they only gettin slimmer
They lookin good for breakfast, I ate them up for dinner
I shoots them in they center, put some holes in yo tummy
I came threw bein hard, niggas froze like the money
The money started comming, the hoe's started shakin
They probably got the profit, the hatas started hatin
Some be congradualatin, I looks them died in they eye
DJ UNK southern style, nigga reppers let it ride nigga reppers let it ride
