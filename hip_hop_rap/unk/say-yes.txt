Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress
Whatever your problems might be
Come and get with me
And get it off your chest

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!

Wazzup ma, how you doin'?
24 in the waist; that's how you do it?
Rockin' them sell with the waistline low
The kind I like, that let the crack show
I ain't neva' did shit but rob a pocket for a ho
Between me and you, this shit's gettin' old
I could see me and you, in this grill,
Or ridin' shotgun while you whippin' the wheel

Come take a trip
With your boy Unk, I want what you want
Don't be talking about what you don't
Open that bottle; shots of patron
Let's get it on
Foreplay my way and she bumpin' my song
5 in the morn'
She holla' one more round before lickin' my cone

Y-E-S
I could take away your stress
I say Y-E-S
I could take away your stress

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress
Whatever your problems might be
Come and get with me
And get it off your chest

So wazzup ma, is you down and wet?
I can see it in your eyes that you ready to cut
Meet me at the crib if you ready to cut
The lights down low if you stressin' for what
If your car messed up, you can borrow one of mine
You got credit card debt, you can borrow one of mine
Just say yes; you can have a piece of mine
That nigga ain't ready, I told the Glock 9

And if the show don't 
Blowin' kush, we can do it in slo-mo
From the front to the back if you say so
Just don't say no cuz I'm feelin you
Four Five cuz your eyes got me hypnotized
Thick thighs, you don't wanna' come and get your prize
And that's you and me, in a life of luxury
Say yes and that's just how it's gonna' be

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress
Whatever your problems might be
Come and get with me
And get it off your chest

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!

Baby girl, don't lie to me
I know you wanna do it
Saw the way that you were lookin' when we was cruisin'
I know I ain't the type to buy you a tulip
Give you a blunt and weed; let's get woozy
Don't say maybe, cuz I ain't askin' you to be my lady
Might as well say yes and you get another sex, roughed up; 
With our clothes, we'll make it

2 in the one, now you beggin me
But it's all good
Just hear me out, I reply "Hell yeah"
Tell me the truth, but shawty can you take it
I think you can...no, I know you will
Wait and chill, I'm just bein' real
Sit back, relax, now tell me shawty
How do you think you wanna'
Be my girl Yeah 
So you wanna' be my queen Yeah
All you gotta do is agree
But I can't promise a damn thang
Just get down damn bitch

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!
