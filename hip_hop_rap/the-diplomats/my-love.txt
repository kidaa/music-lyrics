[Intro: Juelz Santana]
For lovin me girl

Look at what you can do man

Girl c'mon
Let's do it like this
Santana's so focused on you
Come holla at a boy that's focused on you

[Juelz Santana]
Shorty I ain't tryin to give you the run around
I'm just tryin to come get you a run around
Skip through a couple towns
Maybe skip through a couple rounds
If your man act dumb I'ma shut him down
I'm sorta a long distance brother
Long checks,long chips, long dick and rubber
Come roll with a pimp or gangsta
Hustler by nature
Trust that I'll take ya
I'll show you the rules and perimeters
Show you how to move with the ooze how to handle it
Show you how to cut loose soon as we scramble it
On the block as soon as the moon it be scramblin'
And you can be my down ass bitch
Yeah baby that's for sure
I'm a show you how package raw
How to snap it on
How to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone
Just stacks of cash beyond

[Chorus: Juelz + Freeway]
And ya'll nigaz betta cuff ya girls
Cuz Santana and Free is runnin up the girls Yeah
No game just fuck your girls
