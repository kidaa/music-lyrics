Now this here is that bomb diggy diggy
Diggy dang, the dons with me
Killa, willll kill a nigga you thinkin' bout harming me
Capo's corrupted yup, he's the wrong vato to fuck wit yup
Labeled and known as a young Pac to the public
And me, Human Crack in the flesh 
I'm the last of the best 
One word to describe me what, spectacular, YES!
So stay calm shorty, when you see that palmed .40 
I'll pop it slow, you'll rock and roll, like Bon Jovi
So don't fool with the click Ey
Don't fool with the Dips Ey
You will die, you will lie in a pool full of shit Ey!
When that gun with the clip in what
Start dumpin' and rippin', yup
At ya'll head, ya'll some dead summamabitches Ey!
You give a chick hard dick and bubblegum Ey
I give a chick a hard brick and bubble-yum Ey!
Like here, take that, shake that, break that Ey!
In half and please bring me cake back

My proud of what is yo' turn, Jim so burned
Live bitch, why kiss, on my wrist a glowworm
And I keep heat, cause in these streets what you hear?
Just hear woop, woop, whant, whant, beep, beep that's the cops
And you rumble, never, me, hit a humble diva
And I stay with the white, I got Jungle Fever
So tell Lucceey what

Left to left, death to death
You be yellow-taped, outlined, etch-a-sketch
Killa
