Verse One: Black Rob 

I met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then 
Talkin that, how she only dealt with businessmen 
Niggaz baggin joints, money off and on the books 
The ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook 
about them, I doubt them cats waitin for me 
You know them niggaz, them big dudes across the street 
She say, "Yeah, they from over on Mayfair" 
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down 
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out 
This bitch over them with them pointin the chief out 
They want beef out here, they gon' get it 
in the worst way, I'ma show em how Black play 
Roll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes 
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise 
It's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto 
Ran out of ammo and started, throwin bottles 
Runnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit 
Crooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this 
I'll get you back 

Chorus: repeat 2X 

I love you baby 		No you don't 
You drive me crazy		That's right 
I'll never betray thee		Uhh 
I love you baby			C'mon 

Verse Two: Black Rob starts rapping during the chorus 

Yo since the last altercation I been goin to street 
Seein honey at the club ery week and I speak 
I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike 
I ain't know the real deal until last night 
How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll 
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four 
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac 
babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black 
when you get home', we never had chance to get up 
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up 
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey 
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money 
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl 
Youse about to get, fucked with no jail 
I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin 
And plan your extermination, word 

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy 

It took a while to peep your style, Miss I-be-in-workin 
Low profile single, house in Staten Island 
and Manhattan while, them same cats 
you sent to get me boo, is on they to get you 
Fuckin witchu, that small time crack dealin nigga 
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too 
Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up 
And get away scot free without some type of injury 
Nah kill it, I'ma flip the script on you 
Same thing you did to me, I'ma do it to you 
Who knew she was the female Rambo 
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door 
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in 
In the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin 
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong 
Just like that she was gone, now it's over 
Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life 
Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic 
Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt 
and admire how the chick went out 

Chorus: repeat to fade
