My love has gone  
His boots no longer by my door  
He left at dawn and as I slept, I felt him go  
[Loop of Erik Satie, as in Pet Shop Boys' Jack The Lad]  

New York, New York, temperature's droppin'  
The band's out shoppin', not stoppin' 'til ears pop  
Cops protect shops, lots of yellow cabs and bellhops  
And it never stops  

I'm waitin' to do an interview, so much to tell you  
Today I feel close enough to smell you  
Additional dates they were plannin' just fell through  
Florida's out, we fly September 22 to Heathrow  
So there's not really long to go  
Tonight will be a brilliant show  
Lettin' you know I miss you  
More than four hits the floor at a party  
Send my love to everybody  
Please, send my love to everybody everybody everybody everybody...  
Send my love to everybody everybody everybody everybody...  

Honey, I'm writin' from D.C., feelin' queasy  
Stayin' healthy on the road isn't easy  
The TM recommend Sanatogen  
Not one of them could resist takin' the piss  
I miss you like a lock in the door what's more  
I go to sleep with my Walkman 'cos half the crew snore  
Don't mean to be a bore, everybody's been great  
But there's fifteen of us in a bus state-to-state  
So I stay up late with a tape or meditate  
My bed is travellin' at fifty-five mph  
When we make it to L.A., I'll still be miles away  
It's not my best day I'm gonna get some rest  
God bless  

My love has gone  
wo wo  
My love has gone has has has ...  
wo wo  

We just stopped a diner so I'm takin' time  
To write a few lines. I'm fine, sun shinin'  
Bus driver's reclinin' on the grass as the trucks pass  
Gleamin' with a flash of sunlight from the glass  
On the windscreen. As for us there's too much to relate  
We've done five gigs but we're only in our third state  
America's big! You'd love how they pile up your plate  
Only place in the world even I could gain weight  
Our next date is Wilmington, Delaware, Open air  
There's a rumor Melle Mel'll be there  
Anyway, all the best, God bless I'm yawning  
I really miss watching you get dressed in the morning  

My love has gone  
wo wo  
My love has gone  
wo wo  
My love has gone  
No earthly ships will ever  
Bring him home
