He feels her smile when he's afraid,  
it reminds him of his life before she went away  
He might crumble, but he'll not fall,  
if the memory of his only love can stay that way  
Still has his dreams, they will get him through,  
till his life means something more than to lose  
Cos he's still wondering when she's coming home  
and he'll tell her what he's done today  
He doesn't want to lose this memory  
of the only part of life to him that's safe.  
Still hears her key, turn in the door,  
disappointment running through him,  
she's not coming anymore  
He sees his friends, turns on that charm,  
but his heart's not in it, doesn't want to move on  
He has his dreams they will get him through,  
till his life means something more than to lose  
Cos he's still wondering when she's coming home  
and he'll tell her what he's done today  
He doesn't want to lose this memory  
of the only part of life to him that's safe.  
He's missing out on life,  
because he doesn't know how long to keep her in his mind  
His life's been hers too long and now he's picking up the pieces  
just to stay alive  
And he's still wondering when she's coming home  
and he'll tell her what he's done today  
He doesn't want to lose this memory  
of the only part of life to him that's safe.
