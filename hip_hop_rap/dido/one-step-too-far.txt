You can sleep forever, but still you will be tired 
You can stay as cold as stone, but still you won't find peace 
With you I feel I'm the meek leading the blind 
With you I feel I'm just spending wasted time 

I've been waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I'm with you with you 
It's always one step too far 
One step too far 

You can walk too far but still you won't be found 
You can look down on the world but still you won't find love 
You won't find love 

I only get mellow while the feeling of the strife 
If the sun or the moon should give way to doubt 
They would delete - Go Out Right 
Swallow - don't make a sound but tomorrow has to start somewhere 
I only get mellow while the feeling of the strife 
I only get mellow while the feeling of the strife 
Don't Let No One Guide You 
I only get mellow while the feeling of the strife 
Don't Let No One Guide You 
Swallow - don't make a sound 

I've been waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I'm with you with you 
It's always one step too far 
One step too far 

I've been waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting 
I've been waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I'm with you with you 
It's always one step too far 
One step too far
