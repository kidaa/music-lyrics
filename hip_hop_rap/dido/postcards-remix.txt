Oh darling I miss you 
And boy is it hard 
The thought of you leaving 
Is breaking my heart 

New York, New York, temperature's droppin' 
The band's out shoppin', not stoppin' 'til ears pop 
Cops protect shops, lots of yellow cabs and bellhops 
And it never stops 
I'm waitin' to do an interview, 
So much to tell you 
Today I feel close enough to smell you 
Additional dates they were plannin' just fell through 
Florida's out, we fly September 22 to Heathrow 
So there's not really long to go 
Tonight will be a brilliant show 
Lettin' you know I miss you 
More than four hits the floor at a party 
Send my love to everybody 
Please, send my love to everybody everybody everybody everybody... 
Send my love to everybody everybody everybody everybody... 

Oh darling I miss you 
And boy is it hard 
The thought of you leaving 
Is breaking my heart 

Honey, I'm writin' from D.C., feelin' queasy 
Stayin' healthy on the road isn't easy 
The TM recommend Sanatogen 
Not one of them could resist takin' the 
I miss you like a lock in the door what's more 
I go to sleep with my Walkman 'cos half the crew snore 
Don't mean to be a bore, everybody's been great 
But there's fifteen of us in a bus state-to-state 
So I stay up late with a tape or meditate 
My bed is travellin' at fifty-five m.p.h 
When we make it to L.A., I'll still be miles away 
It's not my best day I'm gonna get some rest 
God bless 

Oh darling I miss you 
And boy is it hard 
The thought of you leaving 
Is breaking my heart 
If these walls can't hold you 
My house will be dark 
If these walls can't hold you 
My house will be dark 
Oh darling I miss you 
My house will be dark 
Oh darling without you 
My house will be dark 
Oh darling I miss you
