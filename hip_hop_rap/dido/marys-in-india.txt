Danny is lonely
Mary's in India now
She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago
She left all her things well, her books and her letters from him
But as the sun rises on Mary sets on him
And just dance, and just drink
And just see the things I probably never get the chance to see
Danny's not eating, he's drinking and sleeping
I saw him last night at party, he's definitely thin
He says he's happy, look pretty good
But I think
That as the sun rises on Mary sets on him
And just dance, and just drink
And just see the things I probably never get the chance to say
Danny came over last night and I cooked for him
He talked about you Mary and how much we loved you still
He told me he's packed up your books and your letters and things
But as the sun sets on Mary, it's rising on him
And we danced, and we drank
And I've seen something you probably never got the chance to see
Don't worry, Mary
Cause I'm taking care of Danny
And he's taking care of me
