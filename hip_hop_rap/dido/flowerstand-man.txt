'Bout a month ago I'd never seen your face  
I'd never heard your voice  
'Bout a month ago I am a careful hunter  
And I had to search  
Before I found your love  
'Bout a month ago Are you my boy or the Flowerstand Man  
You bought such colour to this place  
Are you my boy or the Flowerstand Man  
With you I am laid back I don't care if every River runs so dry  
I don't care if every Species were to die I don't care about the Ozone layer  
I wouldn't notice if it wasn't there  
Oh no I don't care if we sell Coke to Africa  
I don't care about apartheid I wouldn't notice if it all get better  
I don't care about the starving who've died  
Your my boy when the way you live and breathe  
I don't care about anything but you  
Your my boy when the way you live and breathe  
I don't care about anything
