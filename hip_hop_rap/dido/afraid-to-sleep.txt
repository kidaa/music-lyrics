We slept in this room together  
but now you're gone  
It's so quiet, I'll turn the TV on  

We lived in this room together  
We painted the walls  
Now time doesn't stand still -- it crawls  

And I'm afraid to sleep  
cause if I do I'll dream of you  
And the dreams are always deep  
on the pillow where I'll weep  

I never realized how much I was in love with you  
till you started sleeping with someone new  
Last night I dreamed again, and you were there  
You kissed my face; you touched my hair  

And I'm afraid to sleep  
cause if I do I'll dream of you  
And the dreams are always deep  
on the pillow where I'll weep  

Lyin' alone in the darkness  
with a memory in my head  
There's a big hole where my heart is  
and a lonely feeling rolling 'round my bed  

And I'm afraid to sleep  
cause if I do I'll dream of you  
And dreams are always deep  
on the pillow where I'll weep  

On the pillow where I'll weep  
I'm afraid to sleep
