I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
I never stick around long enough to make it
I apologize that once again I'm not in love
It's not as if I dont mind your heart ain't exactly breakin'
It's just a thought, only a thought

 If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
Cuz nothin I have is truly mine

I always thought I would love to live by the sea,
to travel the world alone and live more simply
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
cuz there's really nothing left here to stop me.
Its just a thought, only a thought

but if my life is for rent
and I don't learn to buy
I deserve nothing more than I get
cuz nothin I have is truly mine

But if my life is for rent
and I don't learn to buy
I deserve nothing more than I get
Cuz nothin I have is truly mine

While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
Well how can I say I'm alive.

But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy.....

Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cuz nothing I have is truly mine

Well if my life is for rent and I don't lean to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cuz nothing I have is truly mine

Cuz nothin I have is truly mine
Cuz nothin I have is truly mine
Cuz nothin I have is truly mine
