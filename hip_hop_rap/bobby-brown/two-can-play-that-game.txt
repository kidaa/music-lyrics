Thirsty Boots

This song appears on three albums, and was first released on the I Want To Live
album, and has also been released on The Rocky Mountain Collection and The
Country Roads Collection albums.

You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells
You're clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words, the mud of cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
And you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hard and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates
That tumbled by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hard and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

I know you are no stranger now
A crooked rainbow trail
From dancing cliffheads shattered sills
To slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below
Its walls are being scaled
Yes, all of this, and more my friend
Your song SHALL not be failed
