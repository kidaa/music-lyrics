Chorus
Constantly I've got you on my mind
Constantly And not just all the time
I think about you
Constantly If you only knew
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind

At night I try
To close my eyes
But I, I cant get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine
I often pretend
That your my girl
Or at least my friend

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you

Chorus

I practice my words
And I build up the nerve
But uh
Words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye
Time after time
Is love in the air
Or is it all in my mind

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you

Chorus
