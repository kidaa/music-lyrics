Mark Volman   Howard Kaylan:
What will this evening
bring me this morning?

What will this evening
bring me this morning?
Dawn will arrive
without any warning.

What will I say
the next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go alright.

What will I say
the next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
 Will she be outasite?

What will this evening
bring me this morning?
What will this evening
bring me this morning?
A succulent fat one!
A mod little flat one,
maybe a hot one to give me the clap!
maybe a freak who gets off with a strap.

{repeat and fade out}

What will I say
the next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go alright.

What will I say
the next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
 Will she be outasite?
