Well I got a funny feelin'
But I'm gonna stay cool
Something's tellin' me I'm gonna break all the rules,
Let me tell ya I'm not insecure,
But I got an empty felling that you've got the cure

chorus
You said it all, you've got to stay
Too proud to fall, no more to say

Well I'm feeling sober but I'm high on the throne,
Like a demon sick and sick and tired of being alone,
I've made a bed that is hard to lie in,
But if lovin' you is wrong,
I can't do nothing but sin

repeat chorus

Let them hang me
They would if they knew
Even half the things I've been doing with you
Walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor
Watch me swingin' and I still want you more

repeat chorus
