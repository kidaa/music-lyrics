so you'd like to save the world
i suggest you take one person at a time
and start with me
not an ordinary girl
not someone that i should hit upon
and ask,  hey what's your sign babe
have you been reading my mind
what did you find
nothing more or less terrestrial
could i keep you in mind

did you really cry
when you saw the hole in the sky
did you really hold your head and hide your eyes
well that's all right
you might call it ultraviolet radiation
it's only sunlight

so you'd like to save my world
if you could free my inner child
then i could free your inhibitions babe
or would you like to mother me
i love the way you wear
that motorola generation chic mama

have you been reading my mind
what did you find
nothing more or less terrestrial
could i keep you in mind

did you really cry
when you saw the hole in the sky
did you really hold your head and hide your eyes
well that's all right
you might call it ultraviolet radiation
it's only sunlight sha la la sunlight
ah yes it is sha la la sunlight
ah yes it is now sha la la sunlight
it's only sunlight
you might call it ultraviolet radiation

so you'd like to save the world
i'd really like to help you
i'd really like to be you for a while
is that all right
and i could call it ultraviolet radiation
it's only sunlight sha la la sunlight
don't you know sha la la sunlight
it's only sunlight sha la la sunlight
it's only sunlight
but you might call it ultraviolet radiation
