Written by Stevie Nicks. 
Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every day you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much
Is there anything left to say
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly call inside
I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years and the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you I know
Tho the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win
So I try to say
Goodbye my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
We were frail
She said
";Everynight he will break your heart";
I should have known from the first
I'd be the broken hearted
But I loved you from the start
Save us...
And not all the prayers in the world -- could save us
