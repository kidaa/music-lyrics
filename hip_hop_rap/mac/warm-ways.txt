Written by Christine McVie. 
Sleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up,
I can't sleep, with your warm ways,
Forever,
Forever love,
Together,
Together love -
You made me a woman tonight,
Sleep until the morning light,
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up,
I can't sleep, with your warm ways.
Forever,
Forever love,
Together,
Together love -
