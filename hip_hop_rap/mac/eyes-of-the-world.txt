Lindsey Buckingham
tellin' you people, tell you no lie
my heart was breakin', i'll tell you why
CHORUS:
back and forth, lies unfurl...
in the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes of the world....
eyes...eyes...eyes...eyes...
eyes...eyes...eyes...eyes...
mondays children are filled with face....
tuesday's children are filled with grace.....
repeat chorus
