Written by Christine McVie and Colin Allen. 
There's distance between us
And you're on my mind
As I lay here in the darkness
I can find no peace inside
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near it would make it alright
I wish you were here
'Cause I feel like a child tonight
Rain on my window
I can count the drops
But I can't help feeling lonely
There's no way I can stop
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near it would make it alright
I wish you were here
'Cause I feel like a child tonight
Each moment is a memory
Time is so unkind
Every hour, filled with an emptiness I can't hide
There's distance between us
And you're on my mind
As I lay here in the darkness
I can find no peace inside
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near it would make it alright
I wish you were here
'Cause I feel like a child tonight
