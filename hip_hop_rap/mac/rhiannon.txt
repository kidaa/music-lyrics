Rhiannon rings like a bell throu the night
and wouldn't you love to love her
takes to the sky like a bird in flight
and who will be her lover
All your life you've never seen a woman
taken by the wind
would you stay if she promised you heaven
will you ever win
She is like a cat in the dark
and then she is the darkness
she rules her life like a fine skylark
and when the sky is starless
All your life you've never seen a woman
taken by the wind
would you stay if she promised you heaven
will you ever win
will you ever win
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
She rings like a bell throu the night
and wouldn't you love to love her
she rules her life like a bird in flight 
and who will be her lover
All your life you've never seen a woman
taken by the wind
would you stay if she promised you heaven
will you ever win
will you ever win
Rhiannon

Oooooh
Taken by 
Taken by the sky

Taken by the sky

Loves a state of mind
