Come with me
Don't let me hang on a single word
Silence makes me want some more
I can't figure out how you turn me on

The way you talk
Is so damn independent now
I can't figure out if you're fooling me
But you know I'm way out of line

The silence
Pierces my ears when you pass me by
Can't stay on track when your back turns on me
Still my head only ...

Tragedy
Memories often reminding me
Stock in a scenery of this fear
I'm trying to find my way out of here

That's how I fall
I grab on to what I have become
You're letting me go still I'm hanging on
But you know I'm way out of line

The silence
Pierces my ears when you pass me by
Can't stay on track when your back turns on me
Still my head only keeps ways for you

Can't stay on track when you turn your back on me
And it always comes down to this kind of tragedy
Everything you say means everything to me - see
Bring me down, pull me up, let me ride
I went down for you but you turned the fucking tide
Now you know I'm way out of line

The silence
Pierces my ears when you pass me by
Can't stay on track when your back turns on me
Still my head only ...
Still my head only ...
