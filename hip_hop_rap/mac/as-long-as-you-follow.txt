Written by Christine McVie. 
I've been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the Rainbow
I've been dreaming
Thought it was in vain
Ah but now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again
Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
As long as you follow
I've bee wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are
And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes
Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
Yes I can live today
If you give me tomorrow
As long as you follow
Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
Yes I can live today
If you give me tomorrow
As long as you follow
As long as you follow as long as you follow
As long as you follow as long as you follow
As long as you follow as long as you follow
As long as you follow as long as you follow
