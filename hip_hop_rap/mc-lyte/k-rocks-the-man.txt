[K-Rock]
Is it a crime - because it's my time to bust a rhyme
A dope line to make the crowd behind me climb
and then twine to a tune that Milk produced
to make the party people get loose
on the dancefloor, so don't try to hide
Cause I designed the rhyme that make your back-bone slide
to the music, cause it's uplifting
Some may try, but they can't get with this
But it's nothing for y'all to compete with
It's just some smooth shit that's legit
to make you get up when you're at a party
and move.. your.. sexy.. body
Up, down, side to side, around
Come one, come all, come see what we found
A way for y'all to work out y'all frustrations
and groove with the band.. K-Rock's the Man
Now hurry hurry, step right up
to my sideshow, and watch how my rhymes flow
I let my galant talent illuminate
So give three cheers for, K-Rock the Great
Don't debate, the votes are castin
This is one race that I could never come last in
Boy you know that the K don't play
You can't step to me, don't sleep on a DJ
K-Rock, because blockheads I knock
and rock the sock into a state of shock
That's how it's supposed to be
and that goes for those who step close to me
So when you see me, show respect
Cause I met get upset and cold strip and snap the necks
of all of those who don't understand
that K-Rock.. K-Rock's the Man
