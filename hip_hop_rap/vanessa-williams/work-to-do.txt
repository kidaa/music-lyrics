I can't wait to get home to you
      I got so much work to do, work 
      I'm taking care of business baby can't you see
      I goota make it for you, and I gotta make it for me
      Sometimes it may seem boy I'm neglecting you
      But I'd love to spend more time
      But I got so much to do 

      Ooh, I got work to do, I got work baby
      I got work to do, I got a job yeah
      I got work to do, said I got work to do 

      Oh I'm out here trying to make it baby can't you see
      It takes a lot of money to make it let's talk truthfully
      So keep your love light burning
      Oh you gotta have a little faith
      You might as well get used to me coming home a little late, oh 

      Ooh, I got work to do, I got work baby
      I got work to do, I got a job yeah
      I got work to do, said I got work to do 

      I can't wait to get home to you
      I got so much work to do
