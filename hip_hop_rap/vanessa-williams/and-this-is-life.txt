I have felt winter snow
      Melting as it touches my skin
      I have cried heartaches tears
      As summer came shuffling in
      I've run barefoot across moonlit sand
      Found friendship where I thought they'd
      never understand
      Held a newborn baby in these hands

      CHORUS:
      And this is life these precious moments
      And this is life these sad goodbyes
      And this is life this roller coaster
      These days of grace this surprise
      And this is life


      I have hoped, I have prayed
      Wished upon a falling star
      I have found secret strength
      Hidden inside my heart
      Oh I guess that this will always be
      A winding journey to an end I cannot see
      But here I am caught up in this mystery


      CHORUS 

      And love has made me bluer than
      The wildest morning sky
      And love has lifted me until
      I thought that I could fly


      CHORUS 2X 

      And this is life
      This is life
      And this is life
