This one
      That one
      Each one
      Is God's Gift to the world

      They are
      We are
      Each one
      Is God's Gift to the world

      There are no extra people
      In a mansion or a ghetto
      Each heart and soul is counted
      Though they're different than you

      So look across the ocean
      See those on distant corners
      Or see the one beside you
      Look in their eyes and you'll know that it's true

      This one
      That one
      Each one
      Is God's Gift to the world

      We are
      They are
      Each one
      Is God's Gift to the world

      And all the lonely people
      The first ones are the last ones
      All the great and small ones
      The ones that win and lose

      All of the remembered
      Even the forgotten
      From every single nation
      You know it's true . . . true for me and you

      This one
      That one
      Each one
      Is God's Gift to the world

      They are
      We are
      Each one
      Is God's Gift to the world
