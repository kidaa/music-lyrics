Gotta know, baby 
      He's got the look, baby
      I want to know
      He's got the look, baby
      Just got to know 

      One sleepless night
      No end in sight
      Went out to have some fun
      Rocked till morning light
      To my surprise he caught my eye, yeah
      My heart skipped a beat
      What's happening to me 

      He's got the look, baby
      I want to know
      So fine word
      Almost a crime
      He's got the look, baby
      Just got to know
      Anytime get with it
      Gonna make him mine 

      He came to me
      Said  do you like what you see 
      No time for acting shy
      Love's got a hold on me
      His classy style, that sexy smile
      Right then and there I knew
      He was the one for me
      Hey 

      Night dancing hold me closer
      Romancing awe baby
      Sweet love in your eyes
      Together, forever
      That's how it will be 

      He's got the look, baby
      I want to know
      Oh yeah

      Baby, just got to know
