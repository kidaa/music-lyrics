You struck me like lightning
      Turned my world upside down
      When I first laid my eyes on you 
      This feeling's really frightening
      Cuz it seems to me I've found
      The perfect man of all for me to choose
      Used to dream of such a man like you
      Never thought it would come true
      Boy you are the answer to my prayers 

      I never felt like this before and
      You have opened up the door
      Into a space that I would never dare 

      Cuz you give my life a meaning
      And this love we have together
      Is lifting my heart to a higher ground
      I was searching, seeking, finding
      Love came out from its hiding
      And baby, I'm so pleased at what I found 

      The way you seem to be, the only one for me
      This love is truly special, we're 2 of a kind
      I've got you on my mind, we're 2 of a kind 

      This heart of mine is beating inside my chest
      And baby, it's you that I adore
      The nights we spend together are by far the best
      That any woman could be wishing for
      We're lucky baby it's like that
      This ain't no opposites atract
      You make up for all the bad in me 

      So when days of trouble come around
      You know I'd never let you down
      Right by your side is where I want to be 

      Cuz you give my life a meaning
      And this love we have together
      Is lifting my heart to a higher ground
      I was searching, seeking, finding
      Love came out from its hiding
      And baby, I'm so pleased at what I found 

      The way you seem to be, the only one for me
      This love is truly special, we're 2 of a kind
      I've got you on my mind, we're 2 of a kind
