Hark the herald angels sing
      Glory to the new born king
      Peace on earth and mercy mild
      god and sinners reconciled

      Joyful all ye nations rise
      join the triumph of the skies
      with angelic host proclaim
      Christ is born in Bethlehem

      Hark the herald angels sing
      Glory to the new born king

      Hail the heav'n-born prince of peace
      hail the son of rightousness
      Light and life to all he brings
      Risen with healing in his wings

      Mild he lays his glory by
      born that man no more may die
      born to raise the sons of earth
      born to give them second birth

      Hark the herald angels sing
      Glory to the new born king

      Hark the herald angels sing
      Glory to the new born king
      Peace on earth and mercy mild
      god and sinners reconciled

      Joyful all ye nations rise
      join the triumph of the skies
      with angelic host proclaim
      Christ is born in Bethlehem

      Hark the herald angels sing
      Glory to the new born king
