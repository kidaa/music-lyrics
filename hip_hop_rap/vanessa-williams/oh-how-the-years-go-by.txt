In our time of trouble
      We only had ourselves
      Nobody else
      No one was there to save us
      We had to save ourselves

      And when the storms came through
      They found me and you
      Back together
      And when the sun would shine
      It was yours and mine
      Yours and mine forever


      CHORUS:
      Oh how the years go by
      Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes
      All through the changes, the soul never dies
      We fight, we laugh, we cry
      As the years go by


      There were times we stumbled
      They thought they had us down
      We came around
      How we rolled and rambled
      We got lost and we got found
      Now we're back on solid ground


      We took everything
      All our times would bring
      In this world of danger
      'Cause when your heart is strong
      You know you're not alone
      In this world of strangers


      CHORUS 

      If we lose our way
      Any night or day
      Well, we'll always be
      I'm there for you
      And I know you're there for me


      As the years go by
      You know you're not alone
      In this world of strangers


      CHORUS 2X
