[Vanessa] 
      They say it's a river, that circles the Earth 
      A beam of light shinin' to the edge of the universe 
      It conquers all 
      It changes everything 

      They say it's a blessing 
      They say it's a gift 
      They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is 
      It conquers all 
      But it's a mystery 

      1 - Love breaks your heart 
      Love takes no less than everything 
      Love makes it hard 

      And it fades away 
      So easily 

      [Brian] 
      In this world we've created 
      In this place that we live 
      In the blink of an eye babe, the darkness slips in 
      Love lights the world 
      Unites the lovers for eternity 

      2 - Love breaks the chains 
      Love aches for every one of us 
      Love takes the tears and the pain 
      And then turns it into the beauty that remains 

      [Vanessa] 
      Look at this place 
      It was paradise 
      But now it's dying 
      I'll pray for love 

      [Brian] 
      I'll take, my chances that it's not too late 


      [Vanessa] Repeat 1 


      [Brian] 
      And it fades away so easily 
      Oh Oh Oh
