Wings made of paper, or wings made of plaster
      wings of an eagle, or airplane, or faster
      Wings made of wind, made of luck, made of lies
      wings in a brush, in the hush of a night

      Some wings are invisible, some wings are eterned to see
      some are hidden completly

      Who says a hero`s a night on a charger
      braver and stronger and always much larger
      Why not the guy in the tie on the train
      Why not the bomb on the bench in the rain

      Some wings are invisible, some wings are eterned to see 
      some are hidden completly

      Over your shoulder 
      eather the blue 
      something maybe calling
      calling you 

      Wings made of father, or wings made of bayble
      if not for a wings or we ready or brable
      Wings made of dreams, made of love, made of prayer
      wings made of things that can ride of the earth

      Some wings are invisible, some wings are eterned to see
      are they hidden inside of you and me
