His going in the army is the best thing he could do. Now you're free to start to do, what 
      you want to do.
      Albert, Albert, Albert!
      I remember how you told me I should trust you for a year. It would just be 
      for a year. But it's 8 years, Albert. 8 long years Albert.
      It was only a sideline that's what you said. You just needed some money 
      that's what you said. You were going to college and get ahead. Instead of 
      being a music business bum. You were going to NYU and become....An English 
      teacher!
      spoken lines - not part of the song
      An English teacher, an English teacher. If only you'd been an English 
      teacher. We'd have a little apartment in Queens. you'd get a summer vacation, 
      and we would know what life means. A man who's got his Masters is really 
      someone. How proud I'd be if you had become one. It could have been such a 
      wonderful life, I could have been Mrs. Peterson, Mrs. Albert Peterson. Mrs. 
      Phi-Beta-Cappa Peterson, the English teacher's wife.
