Though we dance to the beat
      of a different drum,
      we can learn to live together
      under the same sun

      Sometimes it's hard to understand
      our brothers and sisters from a distant land
      try to embrace another view
      a brand new world is calling out to you

      Though we dance to the beat
      of a different drum,
      we can learn to live together
      under the same sun

      From town to town from shore to shore
      there's a bigger world outside your door
      open your heart to someone new
      the love you give will come back to you

      Though we dance to the beat
      of a different drum,
      we can learn to live together
      under the same sun

      Everybody has a song in their heart
      though sometimes it's hard to sing
      so many voices go unheard
      it's time to start listening

      Though we dance to the beat
      of a different drum,
      we can learn to live together
      under the same sun
