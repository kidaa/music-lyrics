Mary had a baby
      Mary had a baby
      Mary had a baby
      People, keep a comin' and the train done gone

      Laid him in a manger
      Laid him in a manger
      Laid him in a manger, oh lord
      People, keep a comin' and the train done gone

      Shepherds came to see him
      Shepherds came to see him
      Shepherds came to see him, oh lord
      People, keep a comin' and the train done gone

      Named him King Jesus
      Named him King Jesus 
      Named him King Jesus, oh lord
      People, keep a comin' and the train done gone

      When I was a seeker
      I sought both night and day
      And I asked the lord to help me
      and he showed me the way

      CHORUS:
      Oh, Go tell it on the mountain
      over the hills and everywhere
      Go tell it on the mountain
      that Jesus Christ is born

      He made me a watchman, upon the city wall
      and if I am a Christian
      I am the least of all, yeahyeah

      Go tell it on the mountain
      over the hills and everywhere
      Go tell it on the mountain
      that Jesus Christ is born

      CHORUS 4x
