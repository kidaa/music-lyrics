Security 
      Sometimes it's hard
      When I don't know where you're going
      Or where you've been
      I got a broken heart
      Surely, if you let me know you care for me
      My heart will mend 

      Darling, I can't wait forever
      You've got to let me know or let me go let me go
      All I'm saying is
      You can't keep playing with
      A heart that loves you so 

      Security
      That's what we need, to keep our love strong
      Security
      Don't make me wait to long
      Security
      You gotta let me know if this is what you want
      Security
      Don't keep me hanging on


      I'm sure you know
      If you take the time to think about it, you will realize
      Honey, now not too long ago
      I used to play around but that's all over
      You're my only guy 

      Re-evaluate this situation
      Better check out your priorities
      You've got to get it straight
      No hesitation
      If what you want is me 

      Security
      That's what we need, to keep our love strong
      Security
      Don't make me wait to long
      Security
      You gotta let me know if this is what you want
      Security
      Don't keep me hanging on


      Security
      That's what we need, to keep our love strong
      Security
      Don't make me wait to long
      Security
      You gotta let me know if this is what you want
      Security
      Don't keep me hanging on


      Darling, I can't wait forever
      You've got to let me know - or let me go let me go
      All I'm saying is
      You can't keep playing with
      A heart that loves you so
