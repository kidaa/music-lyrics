What child is this who laid to rest
      on Mary`s lap asleeping 
      whom angels breed with anthems sweet 
      while shepherds watch our keeping

      This, this is christ the king
      whom shepherds guard and angels sing

      Haste, haste'll bring him lord
      the babe the son of Mary

      So bring him incense, bring him gold
      come plesant king to him
      The king of kings salvations brings
      let loving hearts enthrone him

      Raise, raise the son on high
      the virgin sings a lullaby 

      Joy, joy for christ is born
      the babe was son of Mary 

      What child is this who laid to rest
      on Mary`s lap asleeping
      whom angels breed with anthems sweet
      while shepherds watch our keeping

      Raise, raise the son on high
      the virgin sings a lullaby 

      Joy, joy for christ is born
      the babe was son of Mary
