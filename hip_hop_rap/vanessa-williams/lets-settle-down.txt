About that dream of him and me,
      in some little town,
      I see the signs. 
      He's coming 'round.

      To a song we can sing called  Happily Ever After 
      quiet talks by the fire and a lifetime of laughter.
      Oh can it be he's ready
      to settle down?

      Just, take that one last giant step
      and you'll see we've found
      A dream to share.
      We're almost there
      We'll settle down.
