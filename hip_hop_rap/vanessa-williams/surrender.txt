I've never felt this way before
      There's nothing else I could want more
      Than something real, only passion can reveal

      With body and soul, I'm used to controlling
      every, everything
      Now, I can let go, let down my guard
      And we'll see how far this love can go


      CHORUS:
      I surrender my heart, I'm giving up
      And I don't wanna fight, I just wanna love
      I surrender it all, I'm giving in
      To the power of love - surrender


      This feels too god, can't bring me down
      Feels like I could never touch the ground
      And how I've waited, truer love anticipated

      With body and mind, I know that there's time
      for every, everything
      Now I can let go, let down my guard
      And how I've waited, truer love anticipated


      CHORUS


      With body and soul, I'm used to controlling
      every, everything
      Now, I can let go, let down my guard
      And we'll see how far this love can go


      CHORUS
