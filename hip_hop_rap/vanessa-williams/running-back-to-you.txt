Boy, you've been running around too long
      Now I think you're running out of time
      No more jumping in and out of my bed
      It's time for me to draw the line
      So you think you can call me the only one
      Then walk out the door
      And you think you can run around having fun
      And just come back for more 
      I think you're living in a fantasy
      It's got to be them or me
      So if you try it one more time
      Baby don't expect me to come running back 

      Running back to you
      Then you'll think about love All the good I gave to you
      I won't come running back
      Running back to you
      I won't come running back
      Running back to you
      And I'll find someone
      Somebody else to give it to
      Oh oh, oh oh
      I won't come running back
      I won't come running
      Oh oh, oh oh
      I won't come running back
      I won't come running 

      Boy, I hope you see before too late
      I won't play the fool - no not this time
      And I'll show you just how wrong you are
      To think I just can't get you out of my mind 

      So you think that you can just play me off, then walk out the door
      And you think that you can just run around
      and come back for more
      I think that you're living in a fantasu
      It's got to be them or me
      And if you dis me once more
      Baby don't expect me to come running back 

      Running back to you
      Then you'll think about love All the good I gave to you
      I won't come running back
      Running back to you
      I won't come running back
      Running back to you
      And I'll find someone
      Somebody else to give it to
      Oh oh, oh oh
      I won't come running back
      I won't come running
      Oh oh, oh oh
      I won't come running back
      I won't come running 

      You can't just dis me when you wanna
      Or come and go when you wanna
      I hear you playing around when you wanna
      Anytime that you wanna
      Or just tell me lies when you wanna
      I got more than you want ah
      Oh, and by the way
      Oh, oh I won't come running back
      I won't come running
      Oh, oh I won't come running back
      I won't come running 

      Running back to you
      Then you'll think about love All the good I gave to you
      I won't come running back
      Running back to you
      I won't come running back
      Running back to you
      And I'll find someone
      Somebody else to give it to
      Oh oh, oh oh
      I won't come running back
      I won't come running
      Oh oh, oh oh
      I won't come running back
      I won't come running
