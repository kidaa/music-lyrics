Your face, my door
      Haven't we both been here before
      Slight trace no more
      You're with me somehow 
      Your touch, my hand
      Softspoken words I understand
      Nights spent, days planned
      I'm asking you how 

      Can this be real
      Can this be love I'm feelin'
      Can this be a dream that fades in morning light
      Can this be real
      Can this be love I'm feelin'
      Are you what you seem
      Will you be real tonight 

      Quick turn, long stares
      Is that a shadow, or are you there
      You feel so near
      What is this confusion 

      Ooo your voice soft and low
      Blends in my ear with breezes that blow
      No choice I know
      I ask my illusions 

      Can this be real
      Can this be love I'm feelin'
      Can this be a dream that fades in morning light
      Can this be real
      Can this be love I'm feelin'
      Are you what you seem
      Will you be real tonight 

      Night goes, and day's here
      I can still remember the taste of a tear
      I still face a cold stare
      The essence of someone is constantly here 

      Can this be real
      I can almost feel your touch
      But you're not there
      This, I need you in the end 

      Can this be real
      Can this be love I'm feelin'
      Can this be a dream that fades in morning light
      Can this be real
      Can this be love I'm feelin'
      Are you what you seem
      Will you be real tonight 

      Your face, my door
      Haven't we both been here before
