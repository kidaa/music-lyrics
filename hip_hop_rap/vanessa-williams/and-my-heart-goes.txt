You make my heart go.....
      Inside out you send me baby
      Round and round your world
      Upside down you make me crazy
      For your love; it's out of control

      Like an evening star
      Shining brightly through me
      When you look into my eyes
      I know we have something
      I'm following my heart
      Trusting where love will lead
      Surrendering my guard
      I found security; oh in you
      Darling you're the one for me
      Tell me that you know


      CHORUS:
      You make my heart go....
      Inside out you send me baby
      Round and round your world
      Upside down you make me crazy
      For your love; it's out of control
      Like a fairy tale
      You kissed life into me
      You cast away my fears
      Finally I'm free
      Anyone can see I'm crazy for you
      You're everything I need
      You're all I want to do
      It's true loving you is magical
      Tell me that you know


      CHORUS


      And my heart goes
      Inside and out
      And my heart feels
      I'm losin control
      Cause my heart knows
      The only one for me, baby can't you see
      And my heart goes
      You turn me round and round
      Cause my heart knows
      Baby don't you know


      CHORUS


      Ad-libOh baby; so in love
      You make my heart go; you know it's for your love
