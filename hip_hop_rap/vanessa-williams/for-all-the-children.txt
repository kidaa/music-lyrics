One little sleigh bell rings
      One little child's voice sings
      Ocean to ocean there's an emotion
      That the season brings
      Flowing around the world
      To every boy and girl
      Now is the season filled with joy and love 
      Boy on the city street
      Girl on the desert sand
      Sister and brother loving each other
      All across the land
      This is the time of year
      Differences disappear
      Spreading goodwill and joy just like the dove 

      And I'm singing this song
      For all the children
      To wish for peace on earth and love
      The whole year through
      'Cause the season belongs
      To all the children of the world
      Singin' this Christmas song
      Reach out and pass it on
      Sing it to all the children of the world 

      Let all the sleigh bells ring
      Hear all the children sing
      Voices arising all harmonizing
      It's a joyful thing
      Watching the world grow small
      Touching them one and all
      This is the season filled with joy and love 

      And I'm singing this song
      For all the children
      To wish for peace on earth and love
      The whole year through
      'Cause the season belongs
      To all the children of the world
      Singin' this Christmas song
      Reach out and pass it on
      Sing it to all the children of the world
