Gracious Good Shepherd
      do you really know who I am?
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      will you answer when I call your name?
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      you can hear confusion crying out
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      what little faith I have I am ashamed

      I visualize an angel
      all freezing and bitter cold
      I cannot believe the love there
      what heavenly sacrifice

      Gracious Good Shepherd
      if you hear me now, I love you so
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      why for me?
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      you say you love the lost born
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      I believe that one is me

      Some tell me the virgin birth is
      a beautiful ancient tale
      But you tell me God's constellation
      led all to the living well

      Gracious Good Shepherd
      if you hear me now, I love you so
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      why, why for me?
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      do you really know who I am?
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      will you answer when I call your name?
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      these are different times, I'm sure you see
      Gracious Good Shepherd
      we need, you now
