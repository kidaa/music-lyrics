If I have a secret resepy
      You would be my baby
      If I have the perfect fantasy
      You would be my baby
      If the world was mine to redesign
      then suddenly you would find
      that you'd be my baby

      If I wrote you poems that made you cry
      Would you be my baby?
      If I say the sweetest lullaby
      Would you be my baby?
      If I promise you the moon and stars
      with heaven waiting in my heart
      Would you be my baby?

      But if I only have
      true love to offer you
      Would that be enough
      to make you want me to?

      I would kiss and talk you then each night
      You would be my baby
      Then had watch you're sleep and hold you tight
      You would be my baby
      I would make you mine for rich upon
      and never need to ask for more
      if you'd be my baby

      You would be my baby

      If I had a chance that we'll romance
      If I can chose my circumstance
      then you'd be my baby

      But if I only have
      true love to offer you
      Would that be enough
      to make you want me to?

      If I have a secret resepy
      You would be my baby
      If I have the perfect fantasy
      You would be my baby
      If the world was mine to redesign
      then suddenly you would find
      that you'd be my
      you would be my baby-would be my baby
