Be a man about it! 
      My heart's ringing like a telephone
      Pick it up and dial in the answer
      Oh I'm sick and tired of being alone
      Let me know if love is what you're after 

      Just be a man about it
      You don't have to worry
      I won't turn you down
      Just be a man about it
      Oh don't complicate it
      Let me know you'll be around 

      I took you from the number one
      When you said you'd be with me forever
      But I don't appreciate the cost that I am paying
      For your being clever 

      So be a man about it
      Oh don't complicate it
      You don't have to lead me on
      Just be a man about it
      Just want you to love me right
      You can't go wrong 

      If you just be a man about it
      You don't have to worry
      I won't turn you down
      Just be a man about it
      Oh don't complicate it
      Let me know you'll be around 

      We could really have a good thing going
      Though we don't know where it will lead
      But we, we've got to keep the communication flowing
      But that's not all I need
      So won'tcha 

      Just be a man about it
      You don't have to worry
      I won't turn you down
      Just be a man about it
      Oh don't complicate it
      Let me know you'll be around 

      So be a man about it
      Oh don't complicate it
      You don't have to lead me on
      Just be a man about it
      Just want you to love me right
      You can't go wrong 

      You just be a man... BREAK 

      We could really have a good thing going
      Though we don't know where it will lead
      But we, we've got to keep the communication flowing
      But that's not all I need
      So won'tcha 

      Be a man about it
