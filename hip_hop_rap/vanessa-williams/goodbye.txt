Do we rally have to say goodbye 
      Look at your heart ache as you try to tell me
      The love we made is not enough for you
      You're walking away from all that we dreamed of
      The things you say are leading to... 

      Goodbye, goodbye
      You made your mind up but your heart can't say it
      Goodbye, goodbye
      Say anything but darling don't say goodbye 

      You wait at the door and turn 'round to see me
      The look in your eyes says you really want to stay
      And then we touch, your hands are a whisper
      They tell my heart that you can't say 

      Goodbye, goodbye
      You made your mind up but your heart can't say it
      Goodbye, goodbye
      Say anything but darling don't say goodbye 

      Oh baby with or without you
      I'll always love what we both knew 

      Goodbye, goodbye
      You made your mind up but your heart can't say it
      Goodbye, goodbye
      Say anything but darling don't say goodbye 

      Don't say goodbye
      Baby, let's talk about love
      Let's talk about it now
      Please baby, don't say
      Baby, let's talk about love
      Without your love I can't go on
      Without you
      Baby don't say
      Baby let's talk about love
