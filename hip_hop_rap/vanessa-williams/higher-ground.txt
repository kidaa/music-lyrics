Walk me over this situation
      Let the sun's light warm my face
      Once again the times are changing
      Once again I've lost my way
      While the words of ancient poets
      Fall like dust upon my shoes
      Greed has grabbed me of my vision
      Turned my heart from higher truths 
      So take my hand and lift me higher
      Be my love and my desire
      Hold me safe, in honor bound
      Take my heart to higher ground 

      I have walked too long in darkness
      I have walked too long alone
      Blindly clutching fists of diamonds
      that I found were only stones
      I would trade my wealth of ages
      for a warmer hand to hold
      Though the path of life is narrow
      But it leads to streets of gold 

      So take my hand and lift me higher
      Be my love and my desire
      Hold me safe, in honor bound
      Take my heart to higher ground 

      In this world we move through shadows
      Never sure of what we see
      While the truth abides between us
      Come and share the truth with me 

      So take my hand and lift me higher
      Be my love and my desire
      Hold me safe, in honor bound
      Take my heart to higher ground 

      Ooh, Ooh
