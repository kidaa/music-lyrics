Never thought that it would be this way without you
      It's taking all I have just to live day to day
      My heart aches for you I can't believe we're through,
      Oh baby, I miss you

      CHORUS:
      I'm lost, lost without you baby
      The days aren't the same the nights are cold and gray
      I need you in my life
      If not now, then someday


      As I think about the times we've shared together
      The way I feel for you I know I'll never feel again
      Memories of loving you still linger in my head
      Oh baby, I miss you


      CHORUS


      There's a feeling deep inside of me
      That just won't let you go
      And the more I try to fight it
      The more it seems to show...can't let you go


      CHORUS 2X
