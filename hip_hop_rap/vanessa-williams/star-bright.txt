Star Bright, first star I see tonight
      Could you oh would you please shine your light
      Shine it so I can see, my savior smilin' at me

      Star Bright, I hear you once proclaimed
      This is the way, keep on followin' me
      and at the end of the road will be, a baby

      And there, in him you'll find, a love that is truly blind
      given so from your heart that love that light, could shine

      Shine, shine, shine, Shine

      Star Bright, first star they saw that night
      I am aware that this love is for me
      and the greatest of gifts is free
      Yet my heart of hearts is heavy

      Star Bright, if I give you my hand
      Could you oh would you please see me through
      I would love to take my heart blue, and give it to you

      And there, in my heart you'll find, a love that is truly blind
      given to me, so that I could let my, light shine

      Shine, shine, shine, Shine, 

      Star Bright
      Star Bright, Star Bright, Star Bright
      Star Bright, Star Bright
      Shine your light
