I saw you with that girl last night
      The both of you were making eyes
      You did it right in front of my face
      As if I had no pride
      And now you're always working late
      You never have much time for me
      And you're expecting me to believe
      That ou're not out with she ...please!
      Tonight I give you my surprise
      I hope that you won't mind
      I'm giving you an eye for an eye
      Baby I've found another
      And he is my lover
      And I'm going out for the rest of your life 
      CHORUS:
      I betcha never thought I'd go that far
      I betch never thought I'd break your heart
      I betcha never even thought at all
      I betcha never, no you never 

      I know that everybody lies, that I know I can't deny
      But what if they're intentional, the intention of your crime
      Cause I know how much I can take, I know my heart demands a change
      If I can't have my way, then all I have to say
      Tonight, I give you my surprise
      In return for all the lies
      I'm giving you an eye for an eye
      Baby I've found another
      And he is my lover
      And we're going out for the rest of your life 

      CHORUS
