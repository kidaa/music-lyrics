I really can't stay, Baby, it's cold outside
      I've got to go 'way, Baby, it's cold outside
      The evening has been, so very nice
      I hold your hands, there just like ice

      My mother will start to worry
      and father will be pacin' the floor
      So really I'd better scurry
      well maybe just a half a drink more

      The neighbours might think, Baby, it's bad out there
      Say, what's in this drink, No caps to be had out there
      I wish I knew how, to break the spell

      I ought to say, no, no, no sir
      at least I'm gonna say that I tried
      I really can't stay, outthere it's cold outside

      I simply must go, Baby, it's cold outside
      The answer is no, Uhh, Baby, it's cold outside
      The welcome has been, so nice and warm
      Look out the window at that storm

      My sister will be suspicious
      My brother will be there at the door
      My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
      well mabe just a half a drink more

      I've got to get home, Baby, you'll freeze outthere
      Say lend me a comb, It's up to your knees outthere
      You've really been grand, but don't you see
      How can you do this thing to me

      There's bound to be talk tomorrow
      at least there will be plenty implied
      I really can't stay, outthere it's cold outside

      Baby, it's cold outside
