I've been searching a long time
      For someone exactly like you
      I've been travelin' all around the world
      Waiting for you to come through

      Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
      Someone like you keeps me satisfied
      Someone exactly like you


      I've been travelin' a hard road baby
      Lookin' for someone exactly like you now
      I've been carryin' a heavy load
      Waiting for the light to come shinin' through


      Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
      Someone like you keeps me satisfied
      Someone exactly like you, Someone exactly like you


      I've been doin' some soul searchin'
      To find out where you're at
      I've been up and down the highway
      In all kinds of foreign lands
      I've been all around the world
      Marchin' to the beat of a different drum
      But just lately I've realized
      Baby the best is yet to come


      Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
      Someone like you keeps me satisfied
      Someone exactly like you makes it all worthwhile
      Someone like you keeps me satisfied
      Someone exactly like you
