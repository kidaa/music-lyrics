Uh how long
      How long have you been away?
      Oh how long, can't find no words to say

      I've kept your picture on my shelf thinkin' 'bout you babe
      only there to remind myself thinkin' 'bout you babe
      I have always care for you, do you still love me?

      Oh my flame my flame
      somethings will never change
      still hold your vision in my mind
      say you still love me say that you love me,say that you love me

      Uh my love
      will I ever make you see
      oh that somehow, you are still apart of me
      maybe we can compromise
      'cause our love just can't be disguised
      I have always care for you, do you still love me?
