I see all the snowflakes, falling down around me
      falling down, lovely and wide
      And all of these snowflakes, falling down around me
      seem so perfect, so right

      Look at them tambling down, each one is a flame
      all of them spining me, daslinly the same
      See how they flow and bend
      swirling in neverending harmony

      They glisten as they decent,
      sparkling like diamonds all the way
      To me it is crystal clear
      I'm not how they appear, shivering out here at my own

      See how different I am, I'm not one of them
      I'm alone
