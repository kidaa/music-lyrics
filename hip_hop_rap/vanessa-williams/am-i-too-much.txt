Pressure, pressure
      Can you feel the heat boy
      I wanna know, are you just a weak boy
      Pressure, pressure
      I don't wanna make you sweat, baby
      But you don't even know what pressure is
      We haven't got started yet 
      I know you've been watching my every move
      But baby what's that look on you face
      Right now
      I'm not your average lady
      Don't act so surprised
      Most boys can't keep up at my pace
      And that's a fact 

      Oh I'm not trying to scare you, no
      I'm only trying to be polite
      So pardon me for asking, baby
      But boy, you look a little uptight 

      Tell me
      Am I too much
      Am I too much for you
      REPEAT 

      Listen up
      If you get to know me
      You'll understand why I am the woman that I am
      You say you're tired of trying to figure me out
      I guess you know by now
      I set the trend and you love it 

      Oh, I'm not trying to scare you, no
      I'm only trying to live my life
      So pardon me for asking baby
      But boy, you look a little uptight 

      Tell me
      Am I too much
      Am I too much for you
      REPEAT 

      Pressure, pressure
      Can you feel the heat, boy
      I wanna know, are you just a weak boy
      Pressure, pressure
      I don't wanna make you sweat, baby
      But you don't even know what pressure is
      We haven't got started yet 

      Are you nervous
      Or do you always act this way
