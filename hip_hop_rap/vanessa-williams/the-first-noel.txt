The first Noel, The angels did say
      was to certain poor shepherds,
      in fields as they lay

      In fields where they
      lay keeping their sheep
      On a cold winter's night, that was so deep

      CHORUS:
      Noel, Noel
      Noel, Noel
      Born is the king of Israel

      When they looked up, and saw a star
      shining in the east, beyond them far
      and to the earth, it gave great light
      and so it continued both day, and night

      CHORUS 2x

      Noel, Noel

      CHORUS 4x
