Someone asked me, about you
      Asked me if this was love, are we serious
      I kindly replied that I loved you
      Don't know if I should be falling again

      There's a part of me, still in misery
      Though I know I got to move on
      I'm scared of commitment
      I'm scared of what could go wrong


      CHORUS
      'Cause if I love again, I could lose again
      That's the chance that I'm gonna take
      I can't be wrong again
      Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you


      It's gonna take me just a moment
      To take this all the way it feels kind of strange
      So what could you do to assure me
      That you won't go astray and hurt me some day


      So no promises, don't want roses
      I've already heard every lie
      And I ain't in no hurry
      and I hope you're not wasting my time
      'Cause if I love again, I could lose again
      That's a chance that my heart could break
      Hate to be wrong again
      Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you


      If I hurt again and I cry again
      That's a chance that I'm gonna take
      I can't be wrong again
      Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you


      Starting over
      Takes me under
      I need your shoulder
      When I can't bear this pain
      I need your love
      To help me make it alright
      Don't need no one
      Runnin' in and out of my life


      CHORUS
      If I love again, and I cry again
      That's the chance that I'm gonna take
      I can't be wrong again
      Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you
