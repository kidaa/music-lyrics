All alone, a rainy night
      No one around but I feel someone watching me
      I look around, the street is bare nobody there
      I wonder what it could be
      As I turned to walk away
      Suddenly I saw his face
      Never minding that we were alone
      Didn't care about the time, at the moment I was feeling fine 
      I was looking into stranger's eyes
      He caught me by surprise
      They looked right through me
      He looked into my eyes
      Never knew
      Never, ever thought that love could be
      That's when he came
      He came and captured me 

      Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it
      Kind of strange and familiar
      But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feeling
      I get the feeling he knows me
      Maybe I could stay awhile, maybe I could make you smile
      I don't have much to do
      Maybe we could walk awhile
      Maybe, maybe we could talk awhile 

      Can't help looking into stranger's eyes
      I was looking into stranger's eyes
      He caught me by surprise
      They looked right through me
      He looked into my eyes
      Never knew
      Never, ever thought that love could be
      That's when he came
      He came and captured me 

      How was I to know this would happen
      Though I didn't know I would meet this stranger
      It's the kind of thing that dreams are made of
      And I keep thinking about stranger's eyes 

      I was looking into stranger's eyes
      He caught me by surprise
      They looked right through me
      He looked into my eyes
      Never knew
      Never, ever thought that love could be
      That's when he came
      He came and captured me
