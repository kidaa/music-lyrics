What did I ever see in him? 
      How could i ever get involved that way?
      Now that it's over I can smile and say,
      What did I ever see in him?

      Boy, I was way out on a limb.
      Now that my feet are on the ground again,
      Now that my senses have been found again,
      What did I ever see in him?

      Is he tender?
      No he's not.
      Is he thoughtful?
      No he's not.
      Am I crazy?
      What's he got 
      that i find so damn appealing?

      What did he ever do for me?
      Well to be honest he was sometimes nice.
      But still it wasn't worth the awful price.
      It was rough
      from the start
      broken dates broken nails, broken heart.
      How did I ever, why did I ever, what did I ever?

      Kim: spoken oh Miss Alvarez don't be so upset. I mean, all men can't be like that.
      VW spoken: Every single one of them.......more chatter..
      Both: 
      Do we need them?
      No we don't.
      Do we want them?
      No we don't.
      Will we leave them?

      VW: No we won't. Tell me what did I say that for?

      Both:
      What did we ever see in them?
      How could we ever think that they were nice?
      Take it from us we paid an awful price.
      It was rough, 
      from the start.
      Broken dates, broken nails, broken heart.
      What did we ever see in....
