JA: 
      I was never crazy for flowers
      I confess that nothing left me colder.
      I could watch a daisy for hours 
      and all i'd feel was several hours older.

      Lilacs or lilies,
      anything you please
      all that they did was make me shrug or sneeze.

      But now i love each blossom that i see
      for a lovely little rose loves me.

      Now my life is Rosie,
      since i found my Rosie.
      With a girl like rosie 
      how could i be blue?

      Hand in hand we'll mosey 
      Me and little Rosie.
      We will be so cozy 
      by a fire built for two.

      Oh i once heard a poem that goes 
      A rose is a rose is a rose.
      But i don't agree 
      Take it from me, 
      There's one rose sweeter than any that grows

      That's my Rosie.
      I'm so glad you chose me.
      Life is one, sweet, beautiful song 
      to me.

      JA: Now my life is Rosie
      VW: Oh, we'll be happy I know.
      JA: Since I found my Rosie.
      VW: Off to the preacher we'll go.
      JA: With a girl like ROsie
      VW: So how could we
      JA: How could I be blue?
      VW: Be blue?

      VW: Oh we'll have us a home out west.
      A nice, little split, level nest.
      And in every room, roses in bloom
      JA: but there's one Rose sweeter than all of the rest.

      JA: And that's my Rosie

      Both:
      I'm so glad you chose me.
      Life is one, sweet, beautiful song.
      If love is right, then, what could be wrong?
      Life is one, sweet, beautiful song to me.
