I was standing at 7:15 waiting for my baby's car
      Just then out stepped the driver of a limousine
      And asked if I was going far 
      I said I've got my mind made up
      I don't wanna leave him baby cause it's clear to me
      That it's just to tough to find another lover like mine 

      With the right stuff
      The right stuff baby
      I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
      Ooh no with Mr. Right


      Just Friday 'bout a week ago
      This fellow called me on the phone
      And said  I live in Paris, don't you want to go
      I know you must be all alone  

      Well, it'll take more than a fancy trip
      Or a chauffeured limousine
      Cause I ain't never seen no one
      Who could give me love like this
      The other fellows don't compare 

      To the right stuff
      The right stuff baby
      I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
      Ooh no with Mr. Right
      Sing 

      He's the only to give me that lovin'
      Cause next to him there is no other one
      He's very sexy and oh so sweet
      And he knocks me off my feet
      Say it 

      I need the right stuff
      I got to have the right stuff
      I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
