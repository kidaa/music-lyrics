I'll be home for christmas
      You can count on me
      Please have snow, and mistletoe
      and presents, by the tree

      Christmas Eve will find me
      where the love light, gleams
      I'll be home for christmas
      if only in my dreams

      Christmas Eve will find me
      where the love light, gleams
      I'll be home for christmas
      if only in, if only in,

      If only in my, Dreams
