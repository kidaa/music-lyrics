Life can be strange, somethings we forget
      or rearrange in time, lose the past
      Tell me the truth, tell me how can I know
      that this new love of ours, that its gonna last

      I need your strength and I feel your worth
      with you I feel protected from all harm

      Where do we go from here it's clear
      You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
      Where do we go from here I know
      No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

      What's in a name, his life just a game
      we color then erase we've been erased, when we lose face
      How many lives, tell me how many tries
      before we get it right before we get it right, the truth is inside

      I need your strength and I feel your worth
      with you I feel protected from all harm

      Where do we go from here it's clear
      You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
      Where do we go from here I know
      No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

      When I never weak, so weak
      to scared to speak
      When I never low, so low
      to tell me, you will never need

      Where do we go from here it's clear
      You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone
      Where do we go from here I know
      No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

      No matter what the road, your love will lead me home
