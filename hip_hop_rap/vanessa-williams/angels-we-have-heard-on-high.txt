There've been times, when I thought I heard angels
      and I must admit, it took me by surprise
      I heard rhythm, and the fullness of life
      so rich, it brought tears to my eyes

      There was a time, I was sure I heard angels
      it was a sound tinged with sadness, but loaded with the joy
      Full of rhythm, and oh such music
      kind of streetwise jubilation at the coming of that blessed boy

      Angels we have heard on high
      sweetly singing o'er the plains
      And the mountains in reply
      echoing their joyous strain

      Gloria, in excel sis deo
      Gloria, in excel sis deo, oh

      Shepherds why this jubilee
      why your joyous strains prolong
      What the gladsome tidings be
      which inspire your heav'nly song

      Gloria, in excel sis deo
      Gloria, in excel sis deo, oh

      Come to Bethlehem and see
      him whose birth the angels sing
      Come adore on bended knee
      Christ the lord, the new born king

      Gloria, in excel sis deo
      Gloria, in excel sis deo, oh

      Angels we have heard on high

      Angels we have heard on high, Gloria
      Angels we have heard on high, Gloria
      Angels we have heard on high, Gloria
      Angels we have heard on high, Gloria

      Angels we have heard
