[guy toking up]
Fuckin buddha comin at'cha live
Direct with the biggest, fattest joint
Comin in with indo flavors
Fuckin buddha comin at'cha like this
'95

[B-Real]
It's, Friday mornin, where the weed at?
Let me dip into my pocket for my fat weed sack
Cause I wanna get high like a plane
in the sky, with the indo cloud in my brain
Where the fuck are my zig-zags and my lighters?
So I can roll it and set it on fire
Damn, I wish I had scissors cause the shit is so sticky
that it's gettin on my fuckin fingers
But it's smokeable, double tokeable
I got the one-hitter quitter bombay shit that's tokeable
I wanna do a joint venture
Let me make sure there ain't no lump in the god damn center
Impregnated lookin joint, fuck it
I can smoke it and I still get faded

[Chorus: x4]
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
Inhale, exhale

"I'm the freaker, the one freaks the funk" [scratch x4]

[B-Real + Sen Dog]
East Coast hittin that blunt, West Coast hittin that honeydip
Marijuana joint, then I want another hit
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
I wanna stimulate my mind so I toke it up
Can I get a hit? Can I get a hooh!?
Gimme that fat bag of weed and the brew
so I can get faded, elevated
Smoke the joint down to a roach then I ate it
I stand true to the yesca, mota
as I keep runnin from the Chota
Gimme dat weed fool and ya zig-zags
Puto don't be holdin out on the big bag

[Chorus]

"I'm the freaker, the one freaks the funk" [repeat to fade]
