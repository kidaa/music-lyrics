[Chorus: B-Real]
Are you ready to die, ready to die, tell me
I see your look in your eye and its deadly
better pray to the sky and get ready
when you decide come on tell me

[Verse 1]
You got a choice in life with a fork in the road
got your back turned with your eyes closed with a blindfold
when you open them up there's a signpost
enter at your own risk better find out where your home is
some chose the streets livin a life outlawed
doubt you'll see me spittin'my game southpole
careful with the choices you make
you gotta live with them, can't you hear the voices you hate
how do you deal with them
some took another path felt they own wrath add drugs to the math
cut the life spans in half from deaths to cold sweats
to soul lets go into the abbys
we are gonna miss you yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I put my fist up I ain't gonna hit you nigga
I got no regrets I ain't gonna diss you nigga
I just pray for you even though you're hard headed
you made your own bed and I hope you don't get wetted
I took the wrongsteps too but I learned from them
I drew heat from my niggaz like the burning sun
but like all lessons I need a self check I still got my strap
but now I use my brain as a weapon
could have stood left chose death no bread underfed
all these niggaz spraying lead pushing on me laying dead
this ain't gonna happen yet bitches I'm a fucking vet
if you're coming for my head you can get a slug instead
every nigga something something dues are they even fucking paid up
what do you say to all the haters writing in the fukin papers
homie wake up or we take up all the ground that you can't make up

[Chorus]
