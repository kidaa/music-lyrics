[Verse 1:]
Imma do my thing
Let me tell you right now
Cause I don't know any other way
Of living my life now
Some of you know the struggle
Some of you live in a bubble
Some of you hustle
And some of you just looking for trouble
I don't follow or lead
Tomorrow's a dream,
Pray to god to intervine
On all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here
You can leave if you wanna
Nothing can stop you
If that's your type of persona
Life is shorter,
Now don't make me say it ten times
I keep going for mine
Even in the end times
I can beat the system
Come on and say it with me
Show me some optimism
We can take over the city

[Chorus:]
Real life represent the sound since the first day
Gangstas, hustlers, grinding out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imaa get it anyway
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imma get it anyway

[Verse 2:]
There comes a time in your life
You gotta go for yours
Staying paid,
Is like the battle of forever more
I stay peddle to the metal
Foot on the floor
Imma keep on the streets,
Knocking down your doors
I'm by the dollar,
Like everybody oughta be
Don't burn nobody,
And make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway
Just find it in the economy
See I ain't coughing
Unless it makes a profit
I'm dropping this so hot
Like every day gossip
Regardless of the climate
I'm gonna get it everday
Even if the bullets spray
Imma get it anyway

[Chorus:]
Real life represent the sound since the first day
Gangstas, hustlers, grinding out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imaa get it anyway
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imma get it anyway

[Sing]
La la la la la
You know we blazing up that
La la la la la
All around the world
La la la la la
Our peoples getting money
La la la la la
Let me hear you sing

So let em hear us holla
Or we'll guide em by the collar
Making it harder for you
Don't wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little,
To make your pain numb
Tippin that bottle
Got you forgettin where you came from
But I'm the same one
Where you think my name's from
Imma keep it moving
And never stop till the games done
Forever we live it, forever we spit it
Remember the minute
You witnessed the realest that ever did it
Still I'm committed
No matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick
I'm putting on a clinic
We in troubled times
Swerving through the double lines
You're in a head on collision
Cause now you served your time

[Chorus:]
Real life represent the sound since the first day
Gangstas, hustlers, grinding out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imaa get it anyway
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imma get it anyway

[Sing]
La la la la la
You know we blazing up that
La la la la la
All around the world
La la la la la
Our peoples getting money
La la la la la
Let me hear you sing
La la la la la
You know we blazing up that
La la la la la
All around the world
La la la la la
Our peoples getting money
La la la la la
Let me hear you sing
La la la la la
You know we blazing up that
La la la la la
All around the world
La la la la la
Our peoples getting money
La la la la la
