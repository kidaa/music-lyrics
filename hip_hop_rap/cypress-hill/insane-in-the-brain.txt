
Who you trin' to get crazy with ese? Don't you know I'm loco?

To da one on da flam
boy it's tough
I just toss that ham on the fryin pan
like spam
it's done when I come in slam
damn, I feel like the son of sam
don't make me wrek shit
wit a automatic got me goin' likke general electric
damn
the lights are blinkin' I'm thinkin'
it's all over when go out drinkin'
OH makin' my mind slow,
that's why I don't fuck with the big four-oh
bro, I got ta' maintain
cuz a nigga like me is goin; insane

[chorus:] insane in da membrane
insane in da brain! [x4]

Do my shit undercover
now it's time for for the blubba
blaba to watch dat belly get fatter
fat boy on a diet don't try it
I'll check your ass like a looter in a riot
much too fast like a sumo slammin' dat ass
leavin' your face in the grass
you know I don't take a chulo lightly
punck just jealous cuz he can't outwrite me
so kick that style, wicked wild
happy face nigga never seen me smile
rip dat mainframe
I'll explain
a nigga like me is goin' insane

[chorus]

Like louie armstrong
played the trumpet
I'll hit dat bong and break ya off something soon
I got ta get my props
cops
come and try to snatch my crops
these pigs wanna blow my house down
and undrground to the next town
they get mad when they come to raid my pad
and I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad
yes I'm the pirate pilot
of this ship if I get
wit' the ultraviolet dream
hide from the red light beam
now do you believe in the unseen
look, but don't make you eyes strain
a nigga like me is goin' insane
[chorus]
