
Ay Caribe el tierra del mi gente hermosa 
Armada Latina 
Cielo y Sol, me acompanan donde quiera 
mi fama hispana 
Hermanito la lucha recien que impieza 
hermano ponle gana 
Yo naci con sangre Taina, yo naci 

Came out the other man 
Southern land 
Didn't have to jump a hand 
Never had another plan 
I'm different to the mother man 
Some will get a summer tan 
It's hotter than a summer jam 
Live for today 
Cause you'll never gettin another chance 
I ain't trippin off the he say and she say 
Cause we say fuck 
And pass me a cuba libre 
That's what we want 
Don't front 
I could see ya but 
You don't want to see the cold heap up front 
How we blow it up 
We came to blow it up, hit the spot 
So we're done 
Representin' in, blowin up 
That's how we show the love 
That's how we pass up all this shit that 
We know gon' come 
It's like the soldier's run is done when the wars won 

[Chorus] 

Latino hasta la muerte 
Chicos they working hard 
Bout the noise, 
Suerte Gracias a Dios, Thank God 
The Cubans from Miami coulda took that coke route 
Marimberos parseros con clinicas 
Santeros con muela 
Que dicen que pueden curar abuelas 
Ya'll like scarface, 
I'm more like Sosa 
Cypress hill pretty flaco 
It's our culture 
From cali to the crib, crib 
Me in miami 
Thank god I'm doin music 
If not I'd be tying families 
I'm not a assholeoh no 
About my cash flow 
Let me take this shit 
and send this letter off to Castro 
ha, ha, ha Dale, come mierda. 

[Chorus] 

We way too hot 
always comin up with something clever 
a cosa nostra 
cypress hill maca fera 
feelin fancy in the hip throne, guayabera 
and we just clowning 
on what we call some, money-lera 
call me sammy 
wild child from the isles 
I can go forever like an old fashioned country mouse 
Stilo be guajiro 
Latino is the lingo 
I'm straight cubanichi 
I bang Pinar del Rio 
Lockin up this function 
Just like Benny More 
Go ahead and play the congas 
And I'm gonna rap over it 
Ya I'm a fool I'm outta here 
Yes sir I gotta go 
Get me some Chiva's Regal 
And slap me some dominos
