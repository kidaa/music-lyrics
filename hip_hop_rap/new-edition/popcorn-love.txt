Ah P is for her personality 
I said the O is for originality 
And the other P is for the perfect love she gives to me 
The C is just cause she loves me 
And the O means shes the only love I got 
And the R and the N, our love will never end 
Well, I know, I know its the real thing 
Because she told me so 
And I know, I know its the real thing 
And Ill never let her go 
I just got to, I just got to have your love 
Popcorn love
