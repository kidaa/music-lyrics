[P. Diddy]
Ladies and Gentlemen it's about that time 
The newest addition to the Bad Boy Family 
Ralph, Ronnie, Ricky, Mike, Johnny 
New Edition 

[Ricky]
Oh baby, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no 
Say it's been so long 

[Ralph]
And it feels like it was yesterday but now we're here to stay 
See we rock this way every time we hit the stage 
Ain't nothing changed 
See it's all the same when we start the show 

[Ricky]
Everywhere we go people show us love just can't get enough in 2003 
It's only a new gain come around our way all we wanna do is spread love 

[Chorus]
It has been so long 
And we can't let you down 
It has been so long 

[Johnny]
We won't ever stop doing what we do 
And that's giving you something that you can feel 
So don't you ever doubt cause we gon turn it out 
And bring down the house and we've only just begun 

We rock from town to town we always put it down 
We only wanna see you out your seats no sitting down 
So people gather round to hear that NE sound 
We got love for all of you 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
How can we let y'all know, know that we 
we just can't let this go 
Music is our love 
Can't stop it now, ain't no other way 
Way for us to go 
Keep on giving love 
Put your hands in the sky if you wanna fly on a natural high 
It's been so long since we got on 
Can't you see we're in it for the long run 

[Chorus x3]
