Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Oh, my lonely girl, lonely girl
Dont you know this lonely boy loves you
Ever since he broke your heart, you seem so lost
Each time you pass my way
How I long to take your hand and say dont cry
Ill kiss your tears away
Hey...lonely girl, my only girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
Dont you know this lonely boy loves you
You think that only his two lips can kiss your lips 
And make your heart stand still
But once youre in my arms youll see
No one can kiss your lips the way I will
The way I will
Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
Dont you know this lonely boy loves you
Dont you know this lonely boy loves you
Ooh...
Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
Let me make, let me make your heart like new, oh, yeah
Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl
