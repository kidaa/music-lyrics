Another time of year
has come
To be loved in a special 
way
We will try to do what's
right
On this very Merry Christmas
Day
Candles burning
Children singing goodnight
There's no worries
Because Santa's on his way
So Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to all who share 
on Christmas day
Merry Christmas to you
Singing Merry Christmas
Although many years
have passed
I'm sure the ? of Christmas
remains the same
Candles burning
Children singing goodnight
There's no worries
Because Santa's on his way
So Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to all who share 
on Christmas day
Merry Christmas to you
Singing Merry Christmas
Through all the people I know
And all the people I care for
We'll make Christmas last
forever
So come along everyone
And sing this song with us
Singing Merry Christmas 
to you
Merry Christmas to all
Who share on Christmas Day
Merry Christmas to you
Singing Merry Christmas
Singing Merry Christmas 
to you
Merry Christmas to all
Who share on Christmas Day
Merry Christmas to you
Singing Merry Christmas
Santa's on his way
Santa's on his way
Singing Merry Christmas
