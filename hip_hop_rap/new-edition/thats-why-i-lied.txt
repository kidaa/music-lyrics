[Intro]
Listen up ma I got something to tell you

[Verse 1]
Theres no kiss from you when I'm leavin in the moring
Theres no roses for you when I know I hurt your feelings
Don't know what happened to us girl I never saw it comin
How did love go down hill 
I think I know why cheatin meant fear

[Brige 1]
I hit the bar by a drink
Sippin slow just to think
That a star would think go cheat
She said it looks like you need a friend
The lonely girl is knocking let me in
We can leave in delay
Take my mind off this pain
Do golden things in the mariot suite
Tell wifey that I might be workin 
Hope I never have to say I lied

[Chorus]
To keep my six
To keep my house to still be here to work things out
To find some way babe
To make it up to you
Thats why I lied
To keep your health
To keep your kin
To still be here to raise our kids
To keep my ring babe I couldn't tell the truth

[Verse 2]
I'm so nervous these days
Got a feelings she'll be calling
I know hurt is on the way 
When I dream of angels falling
Theres no perfect way to say
That my values to you were brokin
Who is that on the phone hello
Let me explain before you go

[Bridge 2]
I hit the bar by a drink
Sippin slow just to think
That a star would think go cheat
She said it looks like you need a friend
The lonely girl is knocking let her in
Whatever no delay
Take my mind off this pain
Do golden things on the mariot suite
I know I said that I was working late
But you found out today  I lied

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From the moment I heard you say you leavin to go
It was the words I though couldn't happen fa sho
I'm already missin your lovin and laughter
The moring after
It's not a whole with out you here
I swear I learn my lesson babe

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Strickly for the ladies
My black sistas
Strickly for the ladies
