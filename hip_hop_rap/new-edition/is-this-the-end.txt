Is this the end?  Are you my friend?
It seems to me, you ought to be free.
You used to be mine when the chips were down.
You used to be mine when I weren't around.
Girl, can't you see how I feel? All these feelings that I feel are real.
Oh, girl, can't you see I need you?

Aw, baby, is this the end?
Aw, baby, is this the end?
Mama told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when.
She told me it would happen when I was much older.
Wish it would've happened then.

Is this the end?
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know.
Is this the end?
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know.
Is this the end?
