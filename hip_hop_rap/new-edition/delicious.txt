April, ?
When you get that smile in your eye. 
Something inside 
Goes wild wild wild. 
Sunshine 
Chase away my rainy days. 
Our summer leave 
Is here. Please stay.
Chorus:
I'll hold HOLD you in my arms next to me. 
You YOU are the one that set me free. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart. 
Delicious. 
I'll HOLD never ever ever let you go. 
You're YOU my taste of honey, girl. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart. 
Delicious. 
Rainbow 
Let me know the storm has past. 
These memories 
Will last and last. 
Passion 
Curling through the core of the night. 
Where have you been 
All my life.
I'll hold HOLD you in my arms next to me. 
You YOU are the one that sets me free. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart. 
Delicious. 
I'll HOLD never ever ever let you go. 
You're YOU my taste of honey, girl. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart. 
Delicious. 
We as one 
Here we lie. 
Holding hands 
Across the sky. 
Please be mine. I'll never ever leave you. 
Please be mine. 
I'll hold HOLD you in my arms next to me. 
You YOU are the one that sets me free. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart. 
Delicious. 
I'll HOLD never ever ever let you go. 
You're YOU my taste of honey, girl. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart.

I'll hold HOLD you in my arms next to me. 
You YOU are the one that set me free. 
You YOU put the fire in my heart.
