Look at you, more beautiful than ever 

[Verse 1]
Did I stay away too long 
Have we grown apart are we still cool? 
Crazy ideas I've been thinking every minute cause I miss you 

Now you look more beautiful than the day I first met you 
Yes, true love keeps growing up but it always feels younger 

[Chorus]
I see your face and everything feels new again 
Love til the end starts over again 
Just like the first timeover and over 
Feels like the first time every time 

I hold you I go back to the beginning 
Remember when we traded our first kisses 
Over and over [x3]

[Verse 2]
I see you face and the vibe is sexy 
Come take a picture with paparazzi 
And I'll be feelin' on your hips all over again and again 
And if you ask I'ma take it to the kitchen sink and strip 
Keep you feelin' like you lovin' this relationship 
And I think I'ma love you til the end starts up again 
We've been best friends but then that's how it's always been 

Like a classic chardonnay you're so sweet and so smooth girl 
So I appreciate you babe cause when we get together it get better and better 

[Chorus]

I hold you I go back to the beginning 
Remember when we traded our first kisses 
Fell in love with you the feeling hasn't changed 
The newness stays the same just like the first time 

[Bridge]
From the moment I fell in love with you 
You stirred up feellings like I never knew 
How could it be my dreams have all come true? 
Are they still fresh every time 
Never lose the new 

[Chorus]

Every time I see your face 
It's like the first time...every time 

[Chorus]

over and over...
