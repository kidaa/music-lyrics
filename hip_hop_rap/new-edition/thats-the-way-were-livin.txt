Hey, what you're looking for is
Not so hard to find
It's in your eyes
Hurry
Don't hesitate you're running
Out of time yah yah
There's no need to be misled
There's no need to work
Oh no we'll show you the way tonight
Chorus:
We're working hard
We're striving for perfection cause
That's the way we're livin'
Perfection's hard, that's why we're
Working overtime
That's the way we're livin' for you
It's up to you, so don't you let nobody
Tell you what to do
Make up your mind
Cause life should be taken one day at a time
Step by step, one by one
We'll show you the way tonight
Chorus
Time, there's no better time Repeat 2x
Chorus and Time, there's no better time repeated
