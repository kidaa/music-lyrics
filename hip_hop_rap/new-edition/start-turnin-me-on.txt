[Chorus]
When you
Start turning me on
I just react when you
Start turning me on 
I can't hold back when you
Start turning me on
I give it to you and

[Verse 1: Ralph]
It started scratching, sweating, mourning 
my body is growing hotter in Georgia
I want cha beside me all over my body
don't worry my neighbours to old to hear us baby when you

[Chorus]
Start turning me on
I just react when you
Start turning me on 
I can't hold back when you
Start turning me on
I give it to you and
Start turning me on
don't stop what you doing

[Verse 2: Ralph]
What do you want me to taste first
baby it don't matter at all
As long as I feel your thirst
baby got me climbing the wall
All I request is 3000 seconds
of your time your soul
baby I lose control when you

[Chorus]
Start turning me on
I just react
Start turning me on 
I can't hold back
Start turning me on
I give it to you and
Start turning me on
don't stop what you doing

[Bridge]
When we start touching, kissing and grinding
got me open temperatures rising
I start shaking, moving and grinding
don't want you to hold back the climax
let it go and show me your love girl
hold me when its all set and done girl
We can do this thing every time
that you start turning me on

[Rap 1: Mike]
You turning me on and on and on and
first thing in the morning the middle we yawning
Your word is born you all I think about
when the snow fall the minks be out
Diamonds and links be out
we in the club where all the drinks be out 
Where the thugs and all the freaks be out
won't you peep me out
Approach me and try to sneak me out
whoever thought you take the kinky route, ouch

[Rap 2: Ronnie]
Pain is pleasure
mommy Ronnie had game forever
Mommy my hobbies ain't chains and leather
mommy my hobbies be planes and cheddar
And the strangest weather
and the Mohave didn't rain forever
But in the club its a different perspective
dance floor electric Ronnie a star mommy its hectic
Since 83' the ladies be in my Mercedes 3
yo whatever the ladies be so please believe

[Chorus Until End]
Start turning me on
I just react
Start turning me on 
I can't hold back
Start turning me on
I give it to you and
Start turning me on
don't stop what you doing

[Adlib Outro]
Oh, turning me babe
You turn me on, you turn me on babe
girl I'm about to lose my mind
Please don't stop what you doing oh, oh babe
And I think I like it, babe
