I've been away for much too long 
I hope you still feel I belong 
I didn't mean to cause you pain 
Nothin' to lose, much more to gain 
So can you stand the rain? 

Just when I thought that we were through 
I found my way right back to you 
I can't change what happened in the past 
And won't promise this time it would last 
Can you stand the rain? 
Can you stand the rain? 

So on the story goes 
Heaven only knows 
The road of life will turn 
A lesson we will learn 
And no one knows but fate how we'll end 
People who know 
They say you can't go 
`Home Again 
But if you ask me 
I'm happy to be home again 

I stand here all alone confused 
'Cause I like living with or without you 
Will our story end 
Like a fairy tail 
Or just another heartbreak 
Only time will tell 
So on the story goes 
Heaven only knows 
The road of life will turn 
A lesson we will learn 
And no one knows but fate how we'll end 
People who know 
They say you can't go 
`Home Again 
But if you ask me 
I'm happy to be home again 
Home Again 
No matter where 
No matter how 
No turning back 
No stopping now 
'Cause we may never ever pass this way again 
Just give me one more chance 
Let me come home again 
So on the story goes 
Heaven only knows 
The road of life will turn 
A lesson we will learn 
And no one knows but fate how we'll end 
People who know 
They say you can't go 
`Home Again 
But if you ask me 
I'm happy to be home again 
Spoken: 
So now you kinda understand the story, right 
Me and the fellas trying to bring this back together 
Just like old times 
Ya'll know when it used to be Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike, Ralph, Johnny 
Take it back like that 
So fellas, let's take this record home 
And this time, let's stay there
