In store signing autographs at the mall
Next in line was a fly girl standing tall
Signed my name and said give me a call baby ya know
the girl screamed and fainted panic on the floor
The body gaurd pulled us the back door
I never saw her anymore- it was an in-store heartbreak
Live at five interview for Channel 2
Saw a cutie thought she was on the T.V. cre
She said after the show I'll be waiting for you cool
After the show she got into the car and what a scence
Her dad was the driver of the limosuine
I didn't know she was only thirteen
It was a young girl heartbreak
People think we don't get lonely
But we're far away from home
One minute 20,000 people
But then they go home, we're alone
It's off to another city
Where everybody knows my name
But when I meet that perfect honey
Is it me she wants or is it my fame
Girlies and groupies and parties all night
Is the life that can lead you to a N.E. heartbreak
From city to city our friends and our fans
they're the ones who can keep us from having
N.E. heartbreak
Center stage N.E. was groovin'
The beatwas hard
And the girlies were movin'
There she was third row center coolin'
She was cold
Last note of the last song
House lights up they came on
When I looked she was gone
It was a 3rd row heartbreak
People think our life is easy
'cause they think we've got it made
But we're living underpressure
Just to be on top
And to give the best that we can give you
And to never let you down
We'll keep strivin' for perfection
N.E. heartbreak is coming to your town
Beware of N.E. heartbreak
Spreading fast and there's no cure
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure
Called up my girl and said
Meet me on the tour
I got a suite cold chillin' on the 50th floior
And I'll leave your ticket at the door
And baby don't forget the pumps
She lost her backstage pass and the room key
Then got stopped by hotel security
And I spent the whole night lonely
And it was a hotel heartbreak
