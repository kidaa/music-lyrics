I know it comes as no suprise, that I.... 
am so in love with u 
When I think of us two, I start feelin' blue 
Somethin' that I gotten used to 
But lately.. I must admit 
Times have been been hard 
Put a strain and pain on my heart 
As much as it hurts to say these words 
I think that it's best for u to 

Leave me... Live ur life 
Don't worry.. I will be alright 
In no time.. u'll find someone 
who's better than I 
Go now.. don't u cry 
I'll always.. be right by ur side 
Maybe someday we'll get another try 
Oh yeah... 

It seems as tho.. Everytime I speak 
Ur name.. I get weak 
Cuz I imagine, before I go to sleep 
That u are right here with me 
Somebody told me, u can't appreciate.. 
What u try to til... it is gone 
But they were so long, cuz I have cherished u 
It's just that I'm not the one... u care... 

Leave me... Live ur life 
Don't worry.. I will be alright 
In no time.. u'll find someone 
who's better than I 
Go now.. don't u cry 
I'll always.. be right by ur side 
Maybe someday we'll get another try

Deep down inside 
Please here me now 
You expect so much 
that's why i'm hurting inside 
And I don't even 
No.. not at all 
Til Appreciate for my average girl 
It feels like we've grown apart 
And I dont know if we... could handle 
the trouble....... 
If not it's gonna hurt me to see u 

Leave me... Live ur life 
Don't worry.. I will be alright 
In no time.. u'll find someone 
who's better than I 
Go now.. don't u cry 
I'll always.. be right by ur side 
Maybe someday we'll get another try 

Leave me... Live ur life 
Don't worry.. I will be alright 
In no time.. u'll find someone....
