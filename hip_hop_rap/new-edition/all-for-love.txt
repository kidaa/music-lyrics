The girl next door has taste and style
Shes lookin so much better to me, yeah
Her flavor is hot as she passes by
Now I want her so much that it makes me scream, yeah
Our eyes collide, couldnt turn away
She licked her lips and smiled at me
When we find ourselves a little hideaway
I knew that I was in for somethin sweet
All for love
Im doin things Ive never done before
All for love
Ill try my best cause shes the one my heart beats for
We hold each other neath the starry skies
I feel the rhythm of our hearts
This is harder than the 4th of July
And I want more of what shes got
I tell her things I always keep inside
I let her look into my soul
She says she loves me, can I squeeze her tight
Tonight there aint no letting go
All for love
Im doin things Ive never done before
All for love
Ill try my best cause shes the one my heart beats for
In a daze all time
Dreaming about her day and night
All for love
Im doin things Ive never done before
All for love
Ill try my best cause shes the one my heart beats for
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
Im doin things Ive never done before
All for love
Ill try my best cause shes the one my heart beats for
All for love
Im doin things Ive never done before
All for love
