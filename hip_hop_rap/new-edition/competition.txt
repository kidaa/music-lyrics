I keep dreaming that one day the whole world 
Will be together, will be together as one,
And there's nothing I can do, but pray that
It comes true, and keep on searchin' for
That miracle, that some say will never be
Competition, is the world summarized in
Just one word, and you know what I mean,
Friends competing with friends
will it ever end
I'm losing all of my patience,
I need a way out, and soon
Chorus:
Time and again we are fighting one another,
Hurting our sisters and hurting our brothers,
It's a shame, why do we play these games,
But they'll come a time when we all will be together, 
Living as one in harmony forever,
You and I, we will light the sky aaaaaaahhhhh
If we're ever gonna be as one, 
We'd better make some changes and fast,
And this time make it last
Cause if we all just take the time,
I'm sure that we will find, all of us
Shed blood of the same kind 
And that's the bottom line so
Chorus 3x
Together as one
Together harmony
Together harmony
