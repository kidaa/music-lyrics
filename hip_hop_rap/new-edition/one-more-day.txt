Spoken Ralph:
Yeah, I can't deny it 
On the inside I'm slowly dyin' 
But with a little love I'll be alright 
Just give me one more day 
I promise I'll make it up to you 
I never meant to hurt you, baby 
Just trust me, listen 
?
Verse 1:
Ricky
I can't deny it 
That you got me cryin' you see 
And I'm, I'm slowly dyin' 
So we can't give up tryin' to be 
?
B Sec:
With a little love it will be all right 
With a little kiss let me hold you tight 
With a little peace it could be fine 
And baby don't you leave me tonight 
Chorus:
I just need one more day 
And I won't make you cry 
Darlin' believe 
And baby don't say good bye 
Look in my heart 
And I won't tell you no lies 
Just one more day 
And loving me will be fine 
?
Verse 2:
Ricky
People tell me 
That true love is blind 
But I'm trying to prove that 
True love is kind 
All that I want 
Is to make things right 
So won't you be my baby tonight 
Chorus:?
I just need one more day 
And I won't make you cry 
Darlin' believe 
And baby don't say good bye 
Look in my heart 
And I won't tell you no lies 
Just one more day 
And loving me will be fine 
?
Bridge:
One more day 
One more day 
One more day 
One more day 
?
B Sec:
With a little love it will be all right 
With a little kiss let me hold you tight 
With a little peace it could be so fine

I just need one more day

Just one more day 
Just one more day 
Just one more day 
One more day
