[Ralph Speaks] Last time 

[Verse 1]
I never had a love I couldn't handle but lately since I lost my baby 
I cried about it all the time can't let it go and I don't know what to do no more 

[Chorus]
The last time I'll ever love someone again 
Give my heart like that again 
That was the last time I'll ever trust somebody else I don't need nobody else 

[Verse 2]
There's something bothering me today 
I haven't heard your voice on my phone ooh ooh ooh oh 
My brother said he saw you and you didn't even ask for me at all 
I don't even know why you let me, my heart is aching 
Oh I'm so lost for words I can't explain how I'm feelin' 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lately I've been missing you everyone's been seeing you 
Why should I pretend my heart's been broke again 
It makes no sense to claim you know 
Where were you when I was down 
It doesn't even matter at all everyone has to fall 

[Chorus]
