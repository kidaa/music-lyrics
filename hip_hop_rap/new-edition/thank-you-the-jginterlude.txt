Here I am 
Standing here, father 
I just wanna take out a little time 
A little time to say thank you 
Oh thank you 
You see you watched over me 
All night long 
You kept me in your lovin' arms 
And I wanna thank you Father I 
Oh I Truly I Truly I thank you 
I wanna thank you 
'Cause they said it couldn't be done 
Lord, oh, but it's because of you 
That we're standing here together as one 
Father I 
Oh I Truly I I thank you 
Father I 
Oh I Truly I I thank you 
Father I 
Oh I Truly I I thank you
