I'm sorry, baby.  I didn't mean to do what I did.
I mean, it just happened so fast, you know?
I woke up out of the situation.  
And I was like, ";Mike, you don't even need to go out like this.";
And that's why I'm calling you, you know?
Just listen to me.
Hear me out, girl.  Hear me out, girl.
My apologies for breaking your heart.
Hear me out, girl.  Hear me out, girl.
My apologies for breaking your heart.
Ooh, at home all alone thinking to my self
What a fool I was for letting you go letting you go.
If I could re-wind the hands of time,
I'd take back every word that made you cry don't cry.
I know I acted kind of crazy I know I acted kind of crazy.
I need you now to understand me please understand me.
Hear me out, girl.  Hear me out, girl.
My apologies for breaking your heart.
Hear me out, girl.  Hear me out, girl.
My apologies for breaking your heart.
Well, now is the time for us to realize how much we mean to each other, girl to each other, girl.
Just don't walk away.  That's much too easy.
I'm begging you to stay stay.
I know I acted kind of crazy I know I acted kind of crazy.
I need you now to understand me please understand me.
Hear me out, girl.  Hear me out, girl.
My apologies for breaking your heart.  You know I'll get down on my knees and say...
Hear me out, girl.  Hear me out, girl.
My apologies for breaking your heart...
