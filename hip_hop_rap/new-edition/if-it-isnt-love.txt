I DON'T LOVE HER
I TRIED TO TELL MYSELF
BUT YOU CAN SEE IT IN MY EYES
SO DON'T DENY
I CAN'T FOOL NO ONE ELSE
THE TRUTH IS IN THE TEARS I CRY CAUSE
CHOURUS:
IF IT ISN'T LOVE 
WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY
WHY DOES SHE STAY ON MY MIND
IF IT ISN'T LOVE
WHY DOES IT HURT SO BAD
MAKE ME FEEL SO SAD INSIDE
OF IT ISN'T LOVE
I TOLD HER I'D NEVER FALL IN LOVE RAP
BUT NOW I KNOW BETTER
HOW DOES IT FEEL
I CAN'T DESCRIBE THIS FEELIN'
THAT CAME WHEN I SAW HER LAST NIGHT
SHE GOT TO ME
I'LL LET YOU KNOW THE REASON
I SAW HER WITH ANOHTER GUY SO
CHORUS
MAYBE SHE'LL TAKE ME BACK
HEY GIRL HE'S BEGGING
I MADE A BIG MISTAKE
WON'T YOU FORGIVE HIM GIRL
NOW I CAN FEEL IT
HE'S NEVER FELT BEFORE
I REALLY LOVE HER
YOU LOVE HER, WHAT?
IT TOOK MY HEART
TO SHATTER IN A THOUSAND PIECES
BEFORE I'D EVER DROP MY PRIDE
LOSING LOVE WORRYING ABOUT MY IMAGE
REALLY HELPED ME REALIZE THAT
CHORUS
