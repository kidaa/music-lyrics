When I'm looking here and there, 
And I'm searchin' everywhere to find your LOVE
But you play so hard to get 
And I haven't found out yet where you are.
You'll never find 
Just what you got. 
Here I come. 
Ready or not.
Hide and seek. 
It's just a game we play. 
Hide and seek.
Swear I gotta find you. 
Sneakin' up behind you. 
Hide and seek.
When I tried so hard to see 
How you keep this mystery around our LOVE
Every simple breath you take 
Always makes the love we make seem so new
You're up to your 
Old tricks again. 
I close my eyes 
And count to ten.
Hide and seek. 
It's just a game we play. 
Hide and seek.
Swear I gotta find you. 
Sneakin' up behind you. 
Hide and seek. 
Hi hi hi hide.
You'll never find just what you got. 
Here I come. 
Ready or not.
Hide and seek. 
It's just a game we play. 
Hide and seek.
Swear I gotta find you. 
Sneakin' up behind you. 
Hide and seek.
Hide and seek. 
It's just a game we play. 
Hide and seek.
Swear I gotta find you. 
Sneakin' up behind you. 
Hide and seek.
Hide and seek. 
Hide and seek. 
Hide and seek. 
Hide and seek. 
Hide and seek. 
Swear I gotta find you. 
Hide and seek. 
Hide and seek. 
Hide and seek. 
Sneakin' up behind you.
