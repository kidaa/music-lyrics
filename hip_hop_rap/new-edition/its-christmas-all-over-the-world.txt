All my life, I've tried to do what's right.  First star I see tonight, please make my wish come true.
Why can't we join hands around one tree?  Let live and let it be.
Make Christmas last forever.
When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh,
Goes all around the world in just a day.
From the North Pole to the Southern tip,
He makes his trip with gifts to give away.  Hear him say,
";It's Christmas, all over the world tonight.
It's Christmas, all over the world.";
All my life, I learned if I was good, and did everything I should, my dreams would all come true.
I can see a special time when we join hands around one tree,
And Christmas lasts forever.
When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh,
Goes all around the world in just a day.
From the North Pole to the Southern tip,
He makes his trip with gifts to give away.  Hear him say,
";It's Christmas, all over the world tonight.
It's Christmas, all over the world.";
