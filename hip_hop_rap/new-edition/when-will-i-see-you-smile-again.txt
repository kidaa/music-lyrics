I'm so sorry, baby, I never meant to hurt you.  Please forgive me.
La da da...
Tears, I see, drop from your eyes.  Tell me why you cry.
Guilt, I feel, when you look at me.  Did I let you down?
Girl, you see that I, I  apologize.
Tell me what to do to get through to you.
Girl, it's not the same.  I knew I was to blame.
Just tell me,  when will I see you smile again.
Tell me, when will I see you smile again?  'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar.
Tell me, when will I see you smile again?  'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar.
Promises, I know I made many times before, and I broke each one of them.
But I had to learn over and over again:  don't hurt the one you love.
Girl, you see that I, I apologize.
Tell me what to do to get through to you.
Girl, it's not the same.  I know I was to blame.
Just tell me, when will I see you smile again?
Tell me, when will I see you smile again?  'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar.
Tell me, when will I see you smile again?  'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar.
Look, baby, listen:
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
You see, I just can't understand why I keep making this same kind of mistake
Over and over again.  But there's one question that remains in the back of my mind, love.
And that is when will I see you smile again?
Tell me, when will I see you smile again?...
