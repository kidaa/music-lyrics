Now that you are here with me, baby, let's do it right.
Lady, you know just what I need.  I want to hold you, oh, so tight.
Baby, just touch me anywhere.  Cutie, you turn me on.  Ooh, baby.
I like to run my fingers through your hair, so, come on and stay with me all night.
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby, all night long.
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady, feelings so strong.
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby, all night long.
Rockin', rolllin', rollin', rock, making sweet love, don't you ever stop.
Naw, sweet baby, no.
How 'bout a little music now?  Let's hear some Marvin Gaye.
Ooh, let me rub your shoulders down.  Let's dance the night away.
Feel your heart beat next to mine.  Baby, I'll make you feel nice.
I think I can tell what's on your mind.  I know I can make it right.
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby, all night long.
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady, feelings so strong.
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby, all night long.
Rockin', rollin', rollin', rock, making sweet lovin', don't you ever stop.
