Girl, if ever the going got rough
Remember 
Were the type to think of backing down
So when you got more than your share
In a minute I knew your heart was in it
I knew that it would make you be your best
Put you to the test
But if sometimes it seems not worth the battle
Thats when youll see
You can count on me
Cause Im with you all the way
Ill never give up this dream
Although it may seem
Theres no way out today [Oh, girl]
Yes, Im with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember Im with you
With you all the way
When you see me
Your eyes say that you need me
But theres another feelin they cant hide
And it hurts so deep inside
To think maybe before Id let you down
Wont you hear me out now
Believe me somehow
Cause Im with you all the way
Ill never give up the dream
Although it may seem
Theres no way out today [Oh, girl]
Yes, Im with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember Im with you
With you all the way
I thought Id never know just where to start
Delivering this promise from my heart
Holding you here in my arms
Has told me what to say, yeah
Cause Im with you all the way
Ill never give up the dream
Although it may seem
Theres no way out today [Oh, girl]
Yes, Im with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember Im with you
With you all the way
