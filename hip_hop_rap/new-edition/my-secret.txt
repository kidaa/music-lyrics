Girl I got a secret
See if you can guess
Put your heart into the
problem
See if you can pass the
test
Can you see it?
It's a natural occurence
1+1 makes 2
If I've been acting crazy that's 
Just one more clue
When I see you
Oh, buildings start to shake ?
Do a double take
Didja get it yet,
get it yet
get it yet
Oooh my secret
Ooh sparks begin to fly
Lightening in the sky
Didja get it yet
get it yet
get it yet
get it yet
My secret
Didja get it yet
Didja get it yet
Didja get it yet
Didja get it yet
get it yet
get it yet

Girl, you should've guessed
Girl there aint much time
So move a little closer
Put your hand in mine
Can you feel it?
I'll try to make it easy
Even knock it out
Before the night is over 
There will be no doubt
You'll find out
Buildings start to shake
Do a double take
Didja get it yet
Didja get it yet
get it yet
Ooh my secret
Ooh sparks begin to fly
Lightening in the sky
Didja get it yet
Didja get it yet

Guesses and you're not

Ooh buildings start to shake
