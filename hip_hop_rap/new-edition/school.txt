Well listen.
When I was very young I used to sit around the house watching Oil Can Harry battle Mighty Mouse
Until my mother said, ";Son, that's not the way to be.  You've got to go to school and learn your ABCs.";
I said, ";Is that it, mom?";
She said, ";That's not even half.  You've got to go to school, you got to learn some math.
You got to learn you to count- 1, 2, 3- and then get freshed up on the history.";
My first day of school I'll never forget. My teacher said, ";Recite the alphabet.";
I said, ";A E M E L R,"; and, as you can see, I didn't get very far.
The teacher said, ";Son, there's nothing to it.  Before the day's over, you'll learn how to do it.
And not only that, you'll learn how to read, and that's one thing in life you'll always need.";
Well, school's not all work. There's fun things to do like gym, lunch, and recess, too.
Kindergarten was easy.  It was mostly play. What I was worried about was elementary.
S C H O O L, you got to go to school and beat that bell.

Ha!  Now something got wrong.  I took another turn.
I didn't want to study, didn't even want to learn.
Didn't want to go to class.  I was always late because school became something that I started to hate.
Started hanging with my boys; didn't mean no harm.  We was going around the school pulling fire alarms.
I was a chilly homeboy, yes, I was down because I came to school just to mess around.
I started hanging in the halls, writing on the walls, until I got started playing basketball.
But I didn't have a job so I couldn't get paid and I couldn't play ball because of my grades.
But I still used to practice each and every day in case the coach decided to let me play.
But it didn't work out the way I planned, so I ran to a man who said he can understand the troubles I was going                         through.
He said, ";Son it's all about going to school.";
So I E-mail, what goes here?________ and now I'm moving up to the big leagues:  high school.
S C H O O L, you got to go to school and beat that bell.

E-mail, what goes here?____________
I'm feeling cool 'cause I was going on to something they call ";high school.";
And I feel important, 'cause things aren't the same, wondering why nobody knows my name.
That became something that I started to miss, and now that I'm here it feels like a big dis.
But, anyway, I had to leave.  I had something to achieve.
It was singing- yeah- that's what I wanted to do, so I got a tutor, because I'm no fool.
Dropping out of school is quite absurd, and it's something New Edition just spread the word.
Stay in school!

Repeat and fade....
