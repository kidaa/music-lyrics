I'm sitting here, writing this letter,
Hoping it will make you feel better. 
We've been through the sunshine and the rain.
And I never realized you were in pain.
Someone has mistreated you,
Left you all alone and blue.
And don't you know it hurts me, too,
And, baby, I know my life won't be the the same.
And if you hear me call your name...
Maryann, you will never need another.
Here I am.  I will be your real lover.
Someone else's plans and his schemes 
Left you with these broken dreams-
Dreams that keep you up all night, yeah.
I know my life won't be the same.
And if you hear me call your name, girl.
Maryann, you will never need another.
Here I am.  I will be your real lover.
You and I could make it if stay together, baby.
And if we try, we will blast off to forever.  Woah, woah!
Maryann, you will never need another.
Here I am.  I will be your real lover.
