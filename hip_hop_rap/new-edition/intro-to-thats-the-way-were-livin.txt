In our world all things must change
Just as New Edition has been rearranged 
Emotionally hurt we shed a tear 
But through your love our tears have disappeared 
That's why this is dedicated to you
So just sit back and let us entertain you
Yeah! Yeah! We gone have some fun tonight
Come on! Yeah! Boston!
Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Boston, Mass
I bring you Ronnie, Johnny, Ricky, Mike and Ralph
The New Edition!
