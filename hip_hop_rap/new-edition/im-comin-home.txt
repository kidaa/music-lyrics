Save tomorrow for me
I'm comin' home to you
Oh girl my baby
repeat
I just called you up
Because you've been on my mind
So I can tell you what I feel
Ooh I'm missing you
I've been away too long
Now I'm coming home to you
It's been hard for me
To fall asleep at night--my love
Because without you
I feel so--alone
So I'm coming home
Save tomorrow for me
I'm comin' home to you
Oh girl my baby
Save tomorrow for me
I'm coming home to you
Oh girl my baby
Since the day I left
And you went on your own way
My life's just not the same
Ooh baby I'm needing you
And longing for your touch
Can I get a message through
I can hardly wait
To hold you in my arms
Oh girl
So don't be busy
Cancel everything
'Cause I'm
Cause tomorrow's my day
Save tomorrow for me aw baby
I'm comin' home to you and I want it all
Oh girl my baby my baby
Save tomorrow for me aw baby
I'm coming home to you girl, I'm comin' home
Oh girl my baby my baby
Save tomorrow for me missing you....needing you
I'm comin' home to you wanting you...each and every minute of the day
Oh girl my baby yeah
Save tomorrow for me I know you know. Sugar, I know you know.
I'm coming home to you I'm comin' home to you
Oh girl my baby ?
Away too long
Missing you so I'm comin' home
Save me tomorrow
Away too long
Missing you so I'm comin' home
Save me tomorrow 
Save tomorrow {Repeat away too long...} 
Baby save tomorrow 'cause I'm comin home
Because without you I feel so alone
Since the day I left
I was needing you
Now I'm comin' home
My baby to you
Can I get a message through
Because I'm comin' home
Home home home home
Home
I love you. I love you, too.
