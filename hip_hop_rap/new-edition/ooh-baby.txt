Oohoohooh 
Since the day I saw you, baby, I knew you were for me 
Always all by myself, I sought your company 
All the fellas told me that you played me for a fool 
Said I wouldnt hang out, Id go home right after school 
What did I do to you 
To make you feel this way 
You said youd be my baby 
Never go away, go away 
How could you leave when I need you, baby 
How could you leave when I need you, baby 
How could you leave when I need you, baby

Oohoohooh How could you leave when I need you, baby 
How could you leave when I need you, baby 
Spent all my time, baby, just working on my form 
Trying to improve myself so I could give you more 
You told me I was turning out the way that I should be 
How could I know that you would turn your back on me 
What did I do to you 
To make you feel this way 
You said youd be my baby 
Never go away, go away
