Ive been livin on the whispers in bed
And if you had a picture
Of what Ive got in my head
Whispers in bed
Your voice is like an angel
And this boy wants to be left
Just an ordinary guy, uh-huh
And youre the vision that this boy wants to carry
Youre perfect, youre the one Ill marry
You and I, we just keep getting closer
Soon it will be alright Its gonna be alright
Ive been livin on your whispers in bed
So full of emotion
Over all the things you said
Whispers in bed
I wish that I could see you
But Ill hold this phone instead
Im a victim of your eyes, uh-huh
And endless pleasures we will have cause its magic
And everything I have, girl, we will share
Oh...oh...oh...I can hardly disguise it
Girl, why should I deny it We have so much to share
Girl, every night when Im home
And Im sittin around on my bed
And I pick up the phone and I dial your number
I always have these images of you
Running around inside my head
And I just wanna let you know
That I, Ralph T., will always love you
Ive been livin on the whispers in bed
And if you had a picture
Of what Ive got in my head
Whispers in bed
Your voice is like an angel
And this boy wants to be left
Whispers in bed
So full of emotion
Over all the things you said
Whispers in bed
And if you had a picture
Of what Ive got in my head
