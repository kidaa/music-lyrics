Verse 1 
I've been knowing you several years watched you laugh even shed tears, my dear 
But we've only been friends and kept it like that 
Now were getting older and I don't know how to act 
As a matte of fact there's something I wanna ask and its... 

[Chorus]
Have you ever considered me as the best man for you please tell me the truth right now 
Have you ever looked at me and said that's who I wanna say I do to I'm talking bout your future now 
Have you ever imagined me as the best man for you 

Have You Ever 

[Verse 2]
I know I'm coming out of the blue, so suddenly 
Just wanted to make sure I was ready to be up front with your sweetie listen to me 
Can't you see I'm so tired 
Of spending time with other women so sick and tired 
Of spending my money and don't wanna I hope you're tired 
Of just being friends and keeping it like that 
Cause we're getting older and I don't know how to act 
As a matter of fact there's something I wanna ask and it's... 

[Chorus]

Why Can't It Be ooh 
Me and You 

[Bridge]
Chillin 
All the time 
Hanging out 
Having a good time

Yes it does 
We'll be happy 

Why Can't I BE ooh 
Me and You 

Is it our history tell me 
Cause I can't see alright 
When did you give a hell 
I really hope you know know 
That I'm in love with you 
Come on and tell me baby I need to know now 

[Chorus x2]

Have You Ever
