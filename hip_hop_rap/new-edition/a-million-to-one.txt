A million to one, that's what our folks think about this love of ours.
A million to one, they say that our love will fade like yesterdays flowers.
They're betting everything that our love won't survive.
They're hoping in time we'll forget each others lives.
A million to one, they say we're too young to know the meaning of love.
A million to one, that they've forgotten the dream that we're dreaming of.
But we'll forgive them because we love them, after all that's said and done.
There's one in a million, a million to one.
A million to one, they say we're too young to know the meaning of love.
A million to one, that they've forgotten the dream that we're dreaming of.
But we'll forgive them because we love them, after all that's said and done.
There's one in a million, a million to one.
