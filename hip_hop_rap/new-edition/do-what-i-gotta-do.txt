I gotta 
I've been feelin' lately like being single 
Or just alone 
To get into myself 
I gotta 
Love ain't easy 
There can be crazy games 
That we play 
Sometimes the rules have to change 
I don't want to treat her cruel 
But I like honesty 
So what am I gonna do? 
I guess I'll 
Do what I gotta do 
And break her heart 
And though I love the girl I know 
That the best thing is for us to be apart 
Be apart, ooh 
I gotta  
Any good relationship starts inside 
Of a happy man 
I think she will understand 
I gotta 
If I tell her straight up then she can only 
Respect me 
Even if we don't agree 
I don't want to treat her cruel 
But I like honesty, baby 
So what am I gonna do? 
Oh, I've got to do 
Do what I gotta do 
And break her heart 
Break her little heart 
And though I love the girl I know 
That the best thing is for us to be apart 
Listen baby, ooh 
Oh, sugar, darlin' 
Do what I gotta do 
I gotta do what I gotta do 
Oh, baby 
What am I gonna do? 
Ooh, let me break it to you gently 
I don't want to 
Do what I gotta do 
Hurt you girl 
All that I can do 
What am I gonna do? 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do 
And I don't want to see you cry, baby 
But what am I gonna do? 
It's hard to say 
It's hard to say good-bye 
To the way that things used to be 
But I'll always be right there 
When you need me 
Ooh, so hard 
Don't wanna say 
Don't wanna say good-bye 
Ooh, baby 
And though I love the girl I know 
Ooh, little girl 
That the best thing Ooh, little girl is for us 
To be apart 
Looks like we're gonna have to say good-bye 
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, beauty, bye, bye, baby 
I don't wanna see you cry baby 
But you know that it's driving me crazy 
Do what I gotta do 
Break her little heart 
And though I love the girl I know 
Things will work out, it's gonna work out, oh baby 
That the best thing is for us to be apart
