Saw you walk into the club last night 
Could not even believe what I was seein' 
How do I even stop thinkin' of you? 
'Cause in my eyes you're still mine 
Nobody told me I would feel like this 
Wanting you more as the years walk on by 
Now I'm not afraid to say what I, I believe 
But I wish you were my wife

First time we met so cool, cool I never knew 
You would become so closely to my heart 
And now when I look back, girl I was so blessed 
The rest never passed the test 
I'm choosy when it comes to newfound friends 
And I wish they could be so smooth 
Just like you 
And you never sweated me girl that was so tight 
You were an angel in my life, oh, if 
I knew then 
What I know now 
What I know now 
Oh, yeah 
You wouldn't be with him 
You would be here 
You'd be here with me
