Girl, I'm leaving you again 
And I thought I'll tell you when. 
I know how you must feel, 
But if you're love's for real. 
You'll try to understand 
That I'm in popular demand. 
When we first met, 
I told you how it would be. 
You said you understood 
And that you'd still keep loving me. 
Now it seems you've changed your mind 
Each and every time. 
Girl, one day we will meet 
You just wait and see.
As of today, it has to be this way. 
Oh, oh, oh. 
Girl, I'm leaving you again 
And I thought I'll tell you when. 
I know how you must feel, 
But if you're love's for real. 
You'll try to understand 
That I'm in popular demand.
Girl, I wish 
That there was a way 
For you and I to stay together 
Forever and a day. 
Girl, I would give you all of my love 
And place no one above. 
And girl, one day we will meet. 
You just wait and see. 
But as of today, it has to be this way. 
Oh, oh, oh.
Girl, I'm leaving you again 
And I thought I'll tell you when. 
I know how you must feel, 
But if you're love's for real. 
You'll try to understand 
That I'm in popular demand.
Oh, girl, please tell me 
Is there a way 
For you and I to stay together 
Forever and a day. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, please tell me 
Will you still love me 
Regardless to the way I leave 
'Cause that's the way it has to bee beee. 
Oooooh. 
Aaaaaaah. 
Shoop shoop shoobop.

Shoop shoop shoobop.

Shoop shoop shoobop.

Shoop shoop shoobop.

Shoop shoop shoobop. 
Means I'm never gonna give you up.
