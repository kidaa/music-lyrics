Seen your picture.

Wish I could phone you.

You're a star now. 
Celebrity. 
Have you forgotten how it used to be? 
We'd play doctor 
In the sand. 
Do you remember back in childhood land? 
Wish I could hold you 
In my arms. 
I miss your candy kisses and your charms. 
Nobody loves you 
The way I do. 
I'll never find another girl like you.
My baby love.

When I'm lonely, 
I can hear your voice inside,

And when I look up
