Bring Back The Memories
Baby you were in my 
dream
We were walking down
the street
when I heard a new melody
It's like a blast from the
past
that old song took us back
to the way that it used to
be
Back to bobby's house in midnight hours
The the night i asked you what's your name
Pledging our love over soda pops
And loving you more and more
everyday
Let the DJ play that special 
song again
Let's bring back the memories
Hey there Lonely Girl
I'll be your Duke Of Earl
Cause that's how it used to 
be
I keep thinking how it must 
have been
It wasn't so long ago
Everything was so simple then
When I loved you with all my
heart and soul
In the book of love 
We're a Million To One
Let's bring back the memories
My Earth Angel
Leave a story to tell
Let's bring back these used to be's
I can make up each and every scne
I'll do-wop and then laugh at me
And I'd like to rewrite my whole
story
With you by my side
In The Still Of The Night
I want to know that you're mine
So bring back those memories
Bring back those memories
We're a Thousand Miles Away
bring back the memories
Earth angel
Earth Angel
Will you be mine
Bring back the memories
Bring back the memories
