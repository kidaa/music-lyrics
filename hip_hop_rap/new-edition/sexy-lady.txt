[Verse 1]

Girl
I can't wait to get you by yourself
Girl
Cause what I about to do ain't for nobody else
C'mon girl
Just the scent of you makes me wanna rush
Girl I've got a plan
So sit back and trust your man

I know you're wonderin' what I'm thinkin' of
And I won't stop untill you've had enough
Can't wait until my lips and your lips touch
in between your thighs
is where I've got my eyes

[chorus]

Sexy lady come here girl
Drive me crazybaby girl
I'm so open  stop it girl
Keep it goin'  baby girl

Sexy lady come here girl
Drive me crazy  baby girl
I'm so open stop it girl, stop it girl

[Verse]

Girl
Your lovin'like we're on a movie screen shh
Can't get too loud the neighbors callin' police
C'mon girl
A man like me could get locked up for seducing you
And if pleasing you is a crime than I'll do the time

I know you're wonderin' what I'm thinkin' of
And I won't stop until you've had enough
Can't wait until my lips and your lips touch
In between your thighs
Is where I've got my eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Can I be your go to
When you need a fix
Can't nobody hold you
Make you feel like this
Baby I just want to know you
Be a playa on your team
Go ahead and bite the pillow
'Cause I know your about to scream

[Chorus]

All I want to do 
Is lay it out for you
Like no other man can do
You know you can get it girl

All I want to do
Is lay down next to you
Tonight I'm gonna prove
You know you can get it girl

Come here girl
Baby girl
Stop it girl

Baby girl
Come here girl

Baby girl
Stop it girl
Stop it girl
