Dialogue: Picture this where it all started was back in Boston, Mass. Some time ago believe that and by reopening the doors to all youth a little salt was thrown on me and my boys you know what I'm sayin' but now we're back picking up where we left off aw yeah and through this song, process of elimination will be done you better believe that
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike
The beginning of a dream
Where our ideas were born
Tell em Ricky To understand what this really means
Let's set the record straight
Once and for all and I'll tell you
'Cause other people imitate
And try their best to recreate
This is where it all started from
So they only perpetrate
But they can never duplicate
This is where it all started from
Yo, it's on you Ron It's nice to be the original
That all the counterfeits like to bite off
We only take it as a compliment
When they copy some of our material
To stay the best among the rest
We work to keep our movements fresh
This is where it all started from
You listen up dap instead of being clones
Why don't you think of something on your own
This is where it all started from
Now there's one more thing we think you should know
Don't be a victim to the wanna be
This is where it all started from
A fake, a fake
'Cause no other's ever gonna be like us
This is where it all started from
Take that
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
We're cool Cool it coooool it now
Let's sweeten it up
Candy girl
Count it off... 1... 2... 1... 2
But you better not, better not
Count me out
'Cause other people imitate
And try their best to recreate
This is where it all started from
So they only perpetrate
But they can never duplicate
This is where it all started from
To stay the best among the rest
We work to keep our movements fresh
This is where it all started from
You listen up dap instead of being clones
Why don't you think of something on your own
This is where it all started from
Yo wait a minute! Hold up! Wait! Stop! Huh! You didn't know we was coming back like this on 'em my brother.
