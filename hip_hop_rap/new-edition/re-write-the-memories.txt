[Mike:]
Man

I don't know what I'm gonna say to her Rizz ya know? 
ooh yeah 
I ain't ever been through nuttin' like this 
This was my heart man

I just gotta step up and just be a man about it 

[Ralph:]
Flashback 
Time passed 
then nothin's the same 
Lost our 
Love in 
Too many games 

And girl I hope that you 
Forgot about 
The reasons you forgave 
But the memories don't seem to go away 
No 

[Chorus:]
No I never ever meant to hurt you 
No I never meant to make you cry 
And I wish I could erase the heartache 
And turn back the hands of time 
And I'm sorry that you're still reminded 
Wish I could just rewrite it 
Our short stories last so long 
Rewrite the memories 

[Ronnie:]
This crazy 
I wish I can do it all again 

[Johnny:]
So much 
To talk about 
that's right 
But nothing to say 
nothin to say 
Cuz words are 
So empty 
When you feel betrayed 

when you feel betrayed 
I can't find a way 
To justify 
The reason I just lied 
why 
But I did it all to spare you any pain 
oh yeah 

[Chorus:]
Cause I never ever meant to hurt you 
never meant to hurt you 
No I never meant to make you cry 
never meant to make you cry 
And I wish I could erase the heartache 

heartache 
And turn back the hands of time 
And I'm sorry that you're still reminded 
Wish I could just rewrite it 

said I'm sorry 
Our short stories last so long 
last so long 
Rewrite the memories 

[Ronnie:]
Baby I know you hurtin 
Just pick up the phone 
Get back where we used to be 
Baby just talk to me 

[Johnny & Ricky:]
Oh baby let me hold you and rewind 
And I wont make that silly mistake twice 
Please hold me cuz I need you in my life 

[Chorus:]
No I never ever meant to hurt you 
No I never meant to make you cry 
And I wish I could erase the heartache 

Wish I yeah, yeah 
And turn back the hands of time 
turn back the hands of time 
And I'm sorry that you're still reminded 
I'm so, I'm so sorry that you still reminded 
If could just rewrite it 
Our short stories last so long 

And I'm sorry that you're still reminded 
Wish could just rewrite it 
Never meant to make you cry 
Our short stories last so long 

[Ralph:]
Rewrite the memories 

[Ricky:]
Rewrite the memories 

[Johnny:]
never meant to make you cry 

[Ralph:]
Get back where we used to be 

[Ricky:]

[Johnny:]
I wanna turn back the hands of time 

[Ralph:]
If I could just rewrite it 
I would just rewrite it 
If I could just rewrite it 
I'd rewrite our memories 

[Mike Spoken:]
Y'all just don't understand 
sorry 
To have somebody real close to you 
sorry for the pain 
When you lost that trust 
You basically lose everything 

[Ralph:]
Ahh suga no, no no no
