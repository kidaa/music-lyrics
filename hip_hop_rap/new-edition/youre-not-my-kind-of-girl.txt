Oh girl I know that you're 
Attracted to me
And I should feel the same 
About you
There's just something wrong
I don't know what it is
That keeps us from becoming a two
It's not your looks, you're very pretty
It's not your style, the way you dress is oh so fresh
It's not the way that you carry yourself
Oh, girl I'm sorry
You're not my kind of girl
Case you're the kind of girl That a man's dreams are made of
Oh girl I'm sorry
You're not my kind of girl
cause you're the kind of girl 
that a man would be proud to call his own
Girl listen to me
You're so pretty
I wouldn't cgange a thing about you
But I've been in love before
So I know how it feels
And the chemistry just isn't there
