Turn me up yo 
That's right 
New Edition 
You don't have to worry 

Chorus:
I know that things aint right 
Seems like all we do is fight 
And it's been on my mind 
You don't have to worry 
I'm gonna make it right 
I'll be on your side 
No more lonely nights 
You don't have to worry 

Verse 1:
Bobby
Lady, I know I've been acting strange 
It seems to me you're tired of playing games 
I've been around 
Had girls here and there 
I did you wrong, but I'll give my life to make it right 

Chorus:
I know that things aint right 
Seems like all we do is fight 
And it's been on my mind 
You don't have to worry 
I'm gonna make it right 
I'll be on your side 
No more lonely nights 
You don't have to worry 

Verse 2:
Bobby
What must I do to make it up to you? 
What can I say, to make you see things my way? 
I know it's hard for you to understand 
I did you wrong but I'll give my life to make it right 

Chorus:
I know that things aint right 
Seems like all we do is fight 
And it's been on my mind 
You don't have to worry 
I'm gonna make it right 
I'll be on your side 
No more lonely nights 
You don't have to worry 
Bridge:
Don't be afraid 
I'll be there whenever you need me 
I'll be there trust in me 
Just call on me 
I won't let you down ohhhh 

Rap:
Mike & Ron
NE expertise please 
Here to put the squeeze on the industry fleas 
Getting cheese, peep these, butter slurs, his & hers 
Chinchilla furs, check the goodfella words 
You don't ever have to worry 
Cause I get in ya like Murry 
And boo, it's only a tight flurry 
You're frontin' cattin', you wanna rumble in the satin 
In a bad ass suite somewhere in lower Manhatten 

Break:
I'm from the street too but I gotta eat to 
Won't hesitate to eat you, other than that gald to meet you 
I spend nights in the ramada my honey's stay laced in Escada 
Chickens is mad that I got her 
Casino style gambiono types smile, kiss you before I twist you 
All the wax is official 
Players' on the set gettin' wet sippin' Perrier Jouet 
So you don't even have to worry, yet 

Chorus: 2x adlib over
I know that things aint right 
Seems like all we do is fight 
And it's been on my mind 
You don't have to worry 
I'm gonna make it right 
I'll be on your side 
No more lonely nights 
You don't have to worry
