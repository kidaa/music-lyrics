Uh-huh, alright, alright, alright, okay, uh-huh, a-yeah

It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground I was like, ";Ohhhhh.. SHIT!";
She's off the hook, I would dress her decently
but look her body is immaculate I'm attackin it from all positions
of thinkin inside my mind-ah
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say,
";Excuse me, can I have your number please?
 I'll get on my knees if I have to";
She'll laugh through, the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked down
No cock-blocking please this one's mine uh
Dimepiece and shit son, shorty was fine
Every line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldn't lie I swear
Sparklin the whole time as I whispered in her ear
Chorus: repeat 2X
	And I know you will see the light
	Baby, once you
	understand, what you
	mean, to me, darling..

";Now some say I'm a LITTLE bit a thug
slash b-boy gentleman but, let me introduce myself
also begin, so that you can further understand what I say";
I took this last swallow of the Gran Moulet
and slid her to the dancefloor, now she like ";WOW!
Oh, damn, money got style";
Funny how things change when you got a liquor in ya
you're quicker with the tongue, givin me rhythm now huh
Block the music and the people out to admire the love
The nerve of us, impervious to the entire club
And like marijuana shotguns let's blow this joint
It's pointless to say here, so let me annoint
Chorus

.. we kissin and we wrestlin - sexual confessions
I never lack to pack prophylact', I learned my lesson
First impression, to be discrete, use discretion
Back of the cab undressin - uh-huh
I'm here witchu, sorta like a bond spiritual
All night, all I could do, is stare at you
Cracked the window and the Alize on the Palisades
Right before she told me her name was Valerie
Her crib was just a mile away, nothin to my salary
She could serve me pain all night and I could tolerate
I'm her horizon right, but in the night though
Night glow type shit and I know you can see the light
Chorus
.. and I know you can see the light
   baby, once you, understand what
   what you mean to me girl what you do no doubt check it out now
   Now I know you can see the light
   Baby, once you..
