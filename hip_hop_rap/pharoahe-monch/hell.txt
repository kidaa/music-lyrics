[Pharoahe Monch]
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-follow for now
For no formidable fights I've been formed to forget
For Pharoahe fucks familiar foes first
befo' fondlin female MC's fiercely
Focus upon the facts that facts can be fabricated to form lies
My phonetics alone forces feeble MC's into defense on the fly
Feel me, for real-a
Let's get the skrilla's out the hands of these gorillas
Make the whole world feel us
From the crack to the cap peelers
to the niggaz in the back shootin craps wit the axe-wheelers
Relax till it's, time for the immaculate miraculous
Thirteen, OOOWWW, THE ILLEST!!
To all my niggaz who been shitted on, let's get it on
Think I'm gonna let it hang, and sit it on
the desk of any redneck record exec
I strike em wit the right hand send em a step
And this is Hell! this is Hell!
This is Hell!9x
This is Hell, incest kids under pressure
In the corner clutchin they genitals by the dresser
A hundred CC's of the uncut cleanest
In the vein, twenty-four hours of intravenous
To the left, we have right wing extremists
On a screen a man exposes his breasts wit no penis
Martinez, probably
Just as raw as Lady Saw Esocidae this is Hell!
This is Hell!8x
This is, this is, this is, this is
This is, this is, this is, this is
[Canibus]
Yo yo I feel like I'm one of the livest
One of hip hop's finest, elite rhymers
And I plan to graduate wit honors
But one day we'll all be a bunch of old-timers wit Alzheimer's 
Lookin at our label's roster wonderin how the fuck they forgot us
After we done recorded dozens of albums
And made em hundreds of thousands of dollars, they still dropped us
We givin niggaz what THE FUCK they want
A holocaust, stompin niggaz wit a thousand man march
I ain't livin in hell, hell's livin in me
That's why I'm always screamin on you fuckin MC's
The shit that I quote, float wit the buoyancy of a boat
wit the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat
Overdose that's extremely fatal
Doctors in white labcoats scramble for an antidote to save you
You can't breathe, your chest feels painful
Your skin color's goin from dark brown to beige-blue
Your whole room's full of angels
All in your ear tryin to tell you which God you should pray to
You pray to Je-sus, but He don't wanna save you
Cuz you unfaithful, so He gives you to Azazel
You're paralyzed on the operatin table
Prayin for Canibus to slice you from head to navel
You banned from TV, banned from CD's
Banned from DVD's and downloadable MP3s!
