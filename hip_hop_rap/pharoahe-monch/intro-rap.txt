Intro Rap
Introducing, the star of the show
Bring it on if you think you can hang
Represent one time time time
May I have your attention, please
What you are about to hear 
is undoubtedly the most incredible MC of the year
Nononono no wait no please no wait no listen um
All that I wish to do is to display 
a braaannd new rendition of style that I have
It'll only take a moment of your time - four minutes!
Then it will be beneficial when it is replenished
But then again, you might never return to the shit you're hearing on the 
radio get burned
I have a dream, one day we will get to the promised land 
Then the president will be me
The government will be Shabaam, Mos and Kweli that's it
All whackness is now banned
Obtain access through retinal scans
Voice verification enhancement, the man who moves his hand 
And will motion light detect you
For genetic confirmation, DNA verification

CODENAME 13
RESIDENCE SOUTHSIDE, QUEENS
ARMED AND DANGEROUS
Smack the nigga in the mouth stabbed his mother in the eyeball
I brawl like Mike Tys - in his prime 
My advice - you think twice before you grime
Cuz I'll wink once one time your bitch is mine
Cuz she's feeling the flow best believe I'm drilling the hole
Heads high kill em wit the low
Revealing, chillin, filling up position to be killing the show
Stoppin em on top feeling plus I'm grilling the dough
For a couple of million or so I'll be willing to blow
Pharoahe look up in the air and a million niggaz are feeling em on the low
Every syllable of mine is an umbilical cord through time
For the sick typical niggaz who choose to pick pitiful rhymes
Spit, shit it's more dimes to get 
More higher levels of spirituality to reach
And I'm trying to win
REFUSE TO LOSE!! 4X
