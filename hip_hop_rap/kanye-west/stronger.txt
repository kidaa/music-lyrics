You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
Awesome, the christian and and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go ape shit
Especially on my best stand on my bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey, take six, and take this, haters

I don't know if you got a man or not,
If you made plans or not
God put me in the plans or not
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me

So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's,  there's only one of me
I'm trippin',  I'm caught up in the moment right?
This is Louis Vuitton dime night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a klondike
Well I'd do anything for a blonde-dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it harder, better, faster, stronger

N- n- now th- that don't kill me
