Man I promise she so self consciouss
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out her parent's look at her funny
Now tell me that an't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurr an't picked a carurr
She's like Fuck I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexis 
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail

[Kanye West]
Man I promise I'm so self conscious
Thats why you always see me with a least one of my watches
Rollies and pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, yo pass the versace
Then I spent $400 bucks on this
Just be like N**** you an't up on this
And I can't even go to the grocery store
With out some ones that are clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to the riches and the diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss because they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper look how we'll stoop
Even if your in a benz you still a n**** in a coup

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I say F*** the police thats how I treat them
We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom
We buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need them
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cuz they made us hate ourselfs and love they wealth
Thats why shorty's holla where the ballas at?
Drug dealer's buy jordans crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But i an't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause f*** it I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before i had a house and i'll do it again
Cause i wanna be on 106 and park pushing a benz
I wanna act balerific like its all terrific
I got a couple of past few bills won't get specific
I got a problem with spending money before I get it
We all self conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Syleena Johnson]
Oh when it all...
It All Falls Down
And When it All Falls Down Who You Gunna Call Now?
Im Tellin You All ..

Cmon Cmon And When It Falls Down
