While y'all was in limbo i raised the bar up

Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
Y'all braides names catch the garter
On nights when ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That i gota do that yayo dance

After each and every show a couple dykes in the van

But with my ego ,i can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fukin hero

Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whippin my momas volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The ___ man that shit that you dont floss

House on the hill
Two doors from tracey ross
And i'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinny ones
She askin bout the speed boats yeah i admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
