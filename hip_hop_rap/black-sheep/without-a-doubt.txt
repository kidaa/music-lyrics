I don't know why it is you point at me that way
I know I have not sinned
At least not in my eyes!
Why can't you all just lead your own sweet lives
He never touched me that way
He never came as I lay
He never even appeared to my eyes
What more do you want me to say?
Will you please listen while I speak in my defence
For you are all mistaken
Or you are surely mad
Would you condemn a girl you think so bad?
These things you say I've done are quite hard to believe
Been sleeping with the Devil
Suppose you know him well
I guess you think I'm going to burn in hell!
