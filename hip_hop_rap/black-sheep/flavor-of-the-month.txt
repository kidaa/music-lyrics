Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper :

There are reasons and fouls to fax and those who get caught in the act
Get the axe, yet, my style is known to catapult like a jet, like a F-15
Yo! my gleem is bright and hard when it strikes
Niggaz get caught in the dead of the nightmare! Ah! you're scared, duck away
Don't get too close or you might just get roast, roast! ha!
I come with the pharaoh, the sparrow, the crow
Just like an arrow to the bone, oh
I piss through your toe, your knee and your cap
Wouh! Decapitate and scatter it, Wouh! Batter it theives and villians, those who aren' t
killin,
that's, there's the willing
Lord, thats the way they choose when you are bound to lose

RZA:

Throw your hands in the air.

Tonite is a special nite.
Throw your hands in the air.

I said : Throw your hands in the air.
Tonite is a special nite.

Throw your hands in the air.
Tonite is a special nite.

Grimreaper :

Well it's the grimreaper, yes I heap fools ,
I keep a low and meager profile and show my style

RZA :

Loose and smile broke up is wild
Slow escapade, they wanna get paid after the show
So, away we go to the MO-tel
Oh-swell
The part is so swell, up and speedin'
And the girls that a been scheming: gonna get the cream and
When I say I'm coming in the house,aahhhaa I am cumming in the House
I'm out..

Throw your hands in the air.
Tonite is a special nite.
Throw your hands up in the air.
Tonite is a special nite X4
