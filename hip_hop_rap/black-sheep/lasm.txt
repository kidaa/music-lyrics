She got less than me
She got less than you or I

Ballin' all night ballin' all day
She won't ball on me
Ballin' all night ballin' all day
She won't ball on me

She will laugh
She will die

Cryin' all night, cryin' all day
She will cry for me
Cryin' all night, cryin' all day
She will cry for me

She will

Smile
She will smile
She will laugh
She will die
She don't care
