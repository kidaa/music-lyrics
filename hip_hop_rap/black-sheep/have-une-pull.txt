TANYA:

You're so hot

Teasing me

So you're blue but I can't

Take a chance on a kid like you

It's something I couldn't do

There's that look

In your eyes

I can read in your face

That your feelings are driving you wild

But boy you're only a child

Well, I could dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

But does your mother know that you're out?

And I could chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

But does your mother know that you're out?

PEPPER:

Take it easy:

TANYA:

Take it easy

Better slow down boy

That's no way to go

Does your mother know?

PEPPER:

Take it easy

TANYA:

Take it easy

Try to cool it boy

Take it nice and slow

Does your mother know?

I can see

What you want

But you seem pretty young

To be searching for that kind of fun

So maybe I'm not the one

Now, you're so cute

I like your style

And I know what you mean

When you give me a flash of that smile

But boy you're only a child

EVERYONE:

Well, I could dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

Does your mother know that you're out?

And I could chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

Does your mother know that you're out?

PEPPER:

Take it easy

Better slow down girl

That's no way to go

EVERYONE:

Does your mother know?

PEPPER:

Take it easy

Try to cool it girl

Play it nice and slow

EVERYONE:

Does your mother know?

Well, I could dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

But does your mother know that you're out?

And I could chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

But does your mother know that you're out?

Well, I could dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

But does your mother know that you're out?

And I could chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

But does your mother know that you're out?
