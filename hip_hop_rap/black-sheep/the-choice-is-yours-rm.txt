As I sit and wait
I can't rest my head
I light my fire
as I smoke another cigarette

your want everything
but you break apart
there's no compromise
inside your purple heart
inside your purple heart
iside your purple
inside your purple heart

I smoke another cigarette
inhale it into my lungs
yes it takes my life away
and then it turns around

oh, I'm gone into the next life
and far beyond
oh, I'm gone into the next life
and far beyond
