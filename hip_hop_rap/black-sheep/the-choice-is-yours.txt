I can hear those lonesome midnight sighs in your sleep
I can hear the freight train's whistle crying's tellin' me
It's telling me, oh darlin' can't you see
Here comes that same old line
Here comes goodbye

Here Comes Goodbye, tonight
Put a hold on all your lies,
It's just not right
It comes as no surprise, this time
Any fool would realize,
Here comes goodbye

Better take some time to talk it over again with me
Better get all your things together now if you leave
It's killin' me, oh darlin' can't you see,
Here comes that same old line,
Here comes goodbye

Here comes goodbye, tonight
Put a hold on all your lies,
It's just not right
It comes as no surprise, this time
Any fool would realize,
Here comes goodbye

I can hear your footsteps movin' slowly across my floor
I can see your shadow look back at me outside my door
What'cha waitin' for?
Oh darlin' I know for sure,
Here comes that same old line,
Here comes goodbye

Here comes goodbye, tonight
Put a hold on all your lies,
It's just not right
It comes as no surprise,
This time
Any fool would realize,
Here comes goodbye

Any fool would realize,
Here comes goodbye
