I know the way the west wind blows,
The way temptation grows,
The way that fortunes flow.
La la la la la.
Wired on emotions,
They don't understand,
But we know better,
I know the way the preachers pray,
And who the angels save,
And where the devil plays.
La la la la la.
Wired on emotions,
They don't understand,
But we know better,
High from motions and we pave the way,
And we know where we want to go,
We know better.
Four hands making plans,
Making signs, conversation,
Two minds lost in time,
Yours and mine.
Wired on emotions,
They don't understand,
But we know better,
High from motions and we pave the way,
And we know where we want to go,
We know better.
