Quatro/Tuckey
You messed my mind
Destroyed my soul
How was I to know about the power of love
You were wiser and older than me
How you touched my heart
Then you ripped it apart
You changed an innocent smile and girlish laughter into crying eyes over night
Good luck I hope you realise
What I gave to you
A virgin's love
A child of trust
Makin' love was something new
You found me so young
And taught me all you knew
But I'm leaving 'Cos I'm wiser than you
I remember when
I thought you were my friend
I believed all those lies you said
She doesn't understand
You're the only one for me
Secret rendezvous
Stolen nights for two
Then suddenly something happened and I realised
I'd given it all to you
Good luck I hope you realise
What I gave to you
A virgin's love
A child of trust
Makin' love was something new
You found me so young
And taught me all you knew
But I'm leaving 'Cos I'm wiser than you
Good luck I hope you realise
What I gave to you
A virgin's love
A child of trust
Makin' love was something new
You found me so young
And taught me all you knew
But I'm leaving 'Cos I'm wiser than you
Good luck I hope you realise
What I gave to you
A virgin's love
A child of trust
Makin' love was something new
You found me so young
And taught me all you knew
But I'm leaving 'Cos I'm wiser than you
