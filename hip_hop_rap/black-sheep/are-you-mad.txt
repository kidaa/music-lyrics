I will follow you. I will swallow you.
I must have all of you. There's nothing you can do.

I will make a weapon of you yet.
I will make you into my own pet.
I will make a wreck of your deepset.
Eyes, and leave you sad and wet.

I will ruin you for every next.
A mess of malfunctioning sex.
I will destroy you dream by dream.
I will addict you to extreme.

I die with every night. I fall with every knife.
I kill with every breath. I trip with every step.
I swallow, flinch and hiss. Lying in my own piss.
I suck with every lick. I drink and slam and hit.

I will make a doorknob of you yet.
I will make you want me to invent.
A better form of this abuse.
And fuck you five ways from obtruse.
I will make a weapon of you yet.
I will make you into my own pet.
I will make a wreck of your deepset.
Eyes, and leave you sad and wet.

I die with every night. I crash with every flight.
I tumble, slide, abrade. I fumble, cry and fade.
I kill with every look. I drill with every hook.
I am the huddled mass.
Love has only ever kicked my ass.

I grow with every use. I know with each abuse.
I blow and suck the juice. While you are blind amused.
I turn with every chance. I tuck with every dance.
I hide and horde and fill. I plan to break your will.
