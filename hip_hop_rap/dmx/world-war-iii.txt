Holly hos, Scarface an 
Bringing terror wit this beretta, I clutch in my palm

Cause disrepected, you dont disrespect me nigga 
I'm the one these niggas call on when negotiations are halting 
and time come for the beating up the bosses 
Make them an offer that can't refuse, they don't comply 
when I walk out they stank these fools

And that's fouler that swalling pork
