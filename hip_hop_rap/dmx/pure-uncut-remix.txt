[Eightball] 

DMX McGruff and Canibus. 
You know where you heard it first. 
My man Cardin, G Black, Ralph, Universal Records. 
Uh [all echoes]. Pure Uncut, 
Eightball [DMX barks in background] 
DMX What DMX, McGruff, McGruff, and Canibus, baby. 
Yeah, its the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw. 
Its the Pure Uncut, raw we keep it raw. Listen... 

[DMX] 

Niggas at Ruff Ryders is the illest, baby gorillas 
And shit we do today is gon' catch up with us and kill us 
Long as I feel this, motherfucker's head is shot 
Fucking lead is hot, and leave them dead to rot 
Ruff Ryders cut the shit up, like raw keys 
Like that crystal aching my last name is Raheed 
It can happen niggas, dog keys, and still gun it down 
Only cause I know how you look up to a nigga, from the ground 
Running clown, you no better, than a braveless heart 
For my kids I thank you God 
And if you don't know, ask a nigga, that they just put in the ground 
Slugs ran out of him, so I must've put in a pound 
At least! I gave it to another nigga for lookin 
Money, could never stop my slugs from cookin 
Remember me, cause I'ma be there when they bury, you 
Leave your skeleton in the cemetery 

[Eightball] 
Dum, du-du, dum 
Who got the, who got the bum bu-bu bum 
We wrap it up and smoke it, sixty green 
I'm a fiend for this rap thing 
Down South hustiln' and we all about the cream 
Stick em up, mad face, car chase through the city 
Fuck the police, I'm mad plus I'm going off that gritty 
Frank Nitty got a mob down to murder with me 
Catch one to stick me, believe it or not, I cripply 
I rip thee, back into a stack and flip it like a tech 
Pure uncut, tie it up, and watch the fiends come back 
Bucklin, real dogs stay around for troublin 
Eightball, pick up the ball, when them tricks start bumblin 
Rumblin vrooom much room, cloud trippin 
Victims who lie there die when I be speakin, releasin 
You heard me, are you worthy 
To ride with the Suave House and get down and dirty 

[Chorus Eightball] 

Its the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw [2X]
Baby Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw 
Its the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw 
What Nigga, Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw 
[repeat]

[McGruff] 

Yo; where the fuck is the dough its time to bubble and blow 
If I spit this from the back, have em clutchin they toes 
Once smoked my lungs out, but now I fuck with my nose 
Perform shows, bad bitches crunchin my clothes 
Yo I'm 'Gruff, street thug beyond the speakers, beyond the rap 
Man I'm on a car and my gat, swarm attack, sip Don and Cognac 
Ain't just me, my whole freakin army strapped 
Aiyyo, fuck that! And fuck you! Who the fuck you 
Touch you, you act like you want trouble 
Money don't know you, don't rub you, I got' eat, that's like trying to tell me don't hustle 
I gotta blow a couple, niggas away just to show the muscle 
Yo, I squeeze till your vocal tussle 
Niggas please, I got keys, coke, and snow to bubble 
Hoes to cuff you, fuck you, suck the shit out your dick 
Sucker for love, think you can fuck with McGruff 
Now listen mister 
Gruff put your soul in a twister 

[Canibus] 

Just got off the payphone, on a three-way line, with Eightball and Tony Draper 

Askin me for a favor 
Now let me take it from the top I touch your knot, with the rubber glock 
Then I take your title, nigga, fuck your spot 
Peace to the players who crush a lot, but they call me Canibus because I bust a lot 
You can suck my cock, and got the same transmitted disease your mother got 
Being a favorite with me right before she was forced to pop 
She came home at four o'clock, was shot, she was riding me on top 
I told the bitch to keep the door locked, I know your heating up hot 
Because I touched the sure spot, you got defeated and dropped 
I punch you in the jaw-ops 
You talk dirt, you get dirt thats how I stand on niggas networks 
You think that best works You think you can't get hurt 
The bitch in you, makes you run for cover when I spit at you 
A man-to-man zone Allen Iverson couldn't dribble through 
Rapid fire syllables, you gotta bribe me with a mill or two 
To keep me from killing you with the lyrical 
All you chief executives ampin answer wreckin shit 
See, what goes around comes around, bitch
