[DMX] 
Same old shit dog, just a different day 
You know how niggaz do, when we play, how we play 
IT IS NOT, A FUCKING GAME! 
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do 
If it's fuck me nigga, you know it's fuck you 
I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand uhh 
Hit him with work, cause yo, that's my little man uh-huh 
He asked a few questions bout the game and I told him yeh 
So when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him aight 
Never told him nuttin wrong, kept it fair 
Didn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin to the air damn 
Everybody makes mistakes, a mistake is aight 
But if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight 
Nobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship 
but shorty's fuckin up big time, I HATE THIS SHIT 
I'm caught in the middle of, havin love for a lil nigga 
knowin what's expected of me as a, real nigga damn 
My next move is crucial, what do I do? 
How do I keep it real with shorty in my crew? 
Didn't want to kill him, so instead of puttin the Mac on him 
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him aight? 

[Chorus: DMX]

Here we go again.. 
Same old shit dog, just a different day 
Here we go again.. 
You know how niggaz do, when we play, how we play 
Here we go again.. 
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do 
Here we go again.. 
So if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you 

[DMX] 
Niggaz that I fuck wit, wanna get him dead 
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live 
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man 
but I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand ooh 
Go about your business uh-huh do what you gonna do uh 
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through aight? 
I can forgive I just can't forget 
You're on your own lil' man don't ask me for shit no 
If you paid attention to what I taught you then you good uhh 
If I see you again, GET IT, understood? 
Go 'head before I change my mind cause you know you should be dead 
"I just wanted to say --" AIGHT?!!!! GO 'HEAD! 
Instinct told me to kill him but the saviour is 
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor hmm 
But I also knew, the decision I just made yeah 
went against the rules of the game that we played damn 

[Chorus]

[DMX] 
I should have, followed my first instinct, cause I knew 
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do 
Now this nigga's fuckin with the competition WHAT? 
Ungrateful motherfucker, shoulda got him missin WHAT? 
This nigga got the nerve, to take my kindness, for a weakness 
Gotsta get back on some street shit so I can creep this 
rat, when I act, take one, set him up, to take two 
get him there, take three, get him done 
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him 
{*barrel spins*} BZZZZZZZT, CLICK! There was a bullet in one of them 
Feelin lucky? CLICK, looks like you are 
CLICK CLICK CLICK, luck ain't goin too far 
What you did was put on another pair of shoes 
and they just happened to be too big 
What you did was stupid damn real fuckin stupid aight? 
Well shorty I gave you a chance and what did you do? 
Threw it back in my fuckin face so FUCK YOU TOO BLAM aight? 

[Chorus 2X]
