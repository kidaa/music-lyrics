I come to you hungry and tired 
you give food and let me sleep 
I come to you weak 
you give strength and that's deep 
you called me a sheep 
and leed me to green pastures 
only asking that I keep the focus 
between the chaptures 
You give me the word and only acts I interpet 
And give me the eyes so I can recognize the serpent 
You know I ain't perfect, but you'll like me to try 
And just like the devil who wants me to lie 
Till I die 
Lord why is it that, that I go through so much pain 
All I saw was black and all I felt was rain 
I come to you because it's you that knows 
To show me that everything is black 
Because me eyes were closed 
You give me the light and let me bask in your glory 
So it was only right that when you ask for this story 
I put together to do all dogs some good 
All dogs being all the brothers and sisters in the hood 
Plenty of times you sent help my way but I hit 
I remember once you held me close but I slip 
There was something that I just had to see 
That you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be 
And I think I am seeing it but I don't feel the same 
Matter of fact I know I have seen it I can feel the change 
And it's strange almost got me beating down your door 
But I have never known love like this before 
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain 
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain 
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone 
I know real so I wipe away the tears son 
And I almost lost faith in you when you took my man Monty 
Pass over chase a brother down 
And I fear that what I saying won't be heard until I'm gone 
But it's all good, Cause I didn't expect to live long 
So if it takes for me to suffer for me brother to see the light 
Give me pain till I die but please lord treat him right
