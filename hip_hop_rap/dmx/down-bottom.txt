[Juve] Mmmm hmmmmm 
[Drag] Ha ha hah 

Oh! Damn, now bop to this 
Yeah, uhh, uhh, y'all know what this is flame on 
Juvenile, Drag-On flame on 
And now.. Swizz Swizz Beats, yea! 

[Drag-On] 
Me and my niggaz done licked shots, even done hit cops 
Betcha niggaz can't wait til my shit drop 
Treat you like your momma, give you lip a pop 
Nigga you don't want my clip to drop 
Cause that means I'm empty, and you're full of it 
Check what the bullet did 
Missiles gonna hit you get you, rip through tissue 
Shoot another rhyme just cause I missed you 
I make plus cash, you little niggaz can't fuck wit Drag 
Got the chain out, so his muscle grabs 
Nigga fuck that, you better bust back 
'fore ya monkey-ass land where the dust at 
Ride like the girl but you can't trust cash 
Spit line of fire and he can't touch black 
All you can do is cuss back 
in your weak raps bout how you bust gats 
Nigga we don't need that, I don't care about your feedback 
Y'all niggaz don't feed Drag 
Til a motherfucker pull out, bust a bullet out 
in the safe house, nigga where the keys at 
Nigga where the stash at, nigga where the weed at 
Nigga pass that 'fore I pull my trigger 
Matter fact where the ass at, cause I got the "Rough Rider" 
and I ain't talkin bout my niggaz 
Cause nigga we can go hoe for hoe, toe to toe, blow for blow 
and when you feel your nose crack 
That mean I broke that, I fill a po'-po' wit a flame thrower 
like I told yo' befo' ya know umm - you can't handle 
You can put me on wax but my fire burn candles 
And who that nigga Ruff Rydin, Drag-On 
Y'all niggaz and Southsiders 

[Chorus: Drag-On + Various repeat 2X]

Do y'all niggaz bust y'all guns 
Hell yeah we bust our guns!! 
Do y'all fuck them til they cum 
Damn right we make them cum!! 
It's for the North HEY South HEY 
East HEY West HEY 
Ruff Ryders gonna show y'all niggaz who ride the best 

[Juvenile] 
Hmmmm, hmmmmmmmm 
In the late night, we be cockin high and givin you stage fright 
Yo head might explode, when I bust with the lead pipe 
Now say it right, Juvenile, HE tight 
Stay hype, now page Mike and make sure he got all the yea, aight 
I'm tired of you niggaz, be thinkin that you usin me 
Runnin with them petty-ass niggaz lookin like fools to me 
I'm workin wit some change aiy 
And aint afraid to put fifty up on ya brain yay 
You bout warrin over yo' people I'm the same yay 
Look, I'ma have somebody sayin that's the shame yay 
But if them people come they ain't gon' give no names yay 
Play with the number one stun'na don't play no games yay 
Come outside and see nothin but camouflage and bricks 
Them gather up boys strapped with cannons 
tryin to knock off yo' shit, you stanky bitch 
I'll Ruff Ryde your ass then, Cash in for Money 
Juven' ain't gettin nuttin ha ha hah that shit is funny 

[Chorus]

[Drag-On] 
When my niggaz get knocked we gonna bail them out 
When it come to my gun my shells is out 
You better get the message, cause I done mailed it out 
that I'ma bang it like a hammer and I'ma nail the South 
East West, and write letters for my niggaz up North 
My guns made in China, so you better dust off 
Comin to getcha, you gon' bleed ketchup, I always got cheddar 
I never ass bet ya, and I won't even sweat ya 
You won't roll four and better 
My dough is never low, but if Drag is down on his last 
I'ma reach in my sweater, bet my Baretta 
Make a nigga feel the heat in the cold weather 
Can't stand a nigga hype, throw me his bitch 
Bitch come to my shit, you betta come get her 
Be like a dog with a bone I run with her 
Y'all make me so tired 
Y'all niggaz still rappin like you don't know my flow is fire 
and y'all ain't got ya suits, ain't got ya boots 
Probably gotta gun that ain't never shoot 
When we come you better hope they don't name you 
Cause like two sticks rubbin I'll flame you 
Don't try to be me cause I ain't you 
'fore I have your spirit with the angels 
My shorty keep a gun on the ankles 
Wanna fuck Watch out she'll bang you 
cause I taught her well, y'all players better haul to hell 
But you niggaz couldn't borrow a belt 
Whoever wit you is goin to jail 
Do you niggaz bust your guns Oh you ain't bustin none, huh 
You wanna fuck em til they cum, huh 

Drag-On, Juvenile, Double R, what you want huh 

[Chorus 2X]
