Ugh Dmx 
Clueminati 
Is ya'll motherfuckers ready for the Ruff Ride! 
Grrrrr! 

[1st Verse]
When I speak I'm understood, my decision is wood 
See what I'm able to see, ugh cuz my vision is good 
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man 
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam 
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent 
Then to open your mouth and remove  cuz if it came violent 
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore 
You don't really want what you asking me for 
It's a war ugh, when it's on it's on, when I'm long what 
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long 
But while I'm here, ugh ya'll niggaz gonna burn 
Be  after this money what and ya'll niggaz gonna learn 
All this fucking weak you've been talking about that driveby 
And they did nothing but driveby's 
Listen shorty I'm telling you this for your own good 
Uhh Everybody is the man in they own hood, for real 

[Chorus x4]

Yeah cuz if it's on it's on 
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!! 

[2nd Verse]
I always keep my enemies the closest uhh 
Always make sure I know where the toast is uhh 
Always cover my tracks when I creep 
Always get away when I'm done to relax to D 
I always know the rules of the game before I play 
And always keep enough dough to know I'm good for the day 
Always walk my dogs off the leash and 
Always get my thoughts off the streets and 
Always will ever lend a hand in borrow 
And always no matter what plan for tomorrow 
I always pay my respects to the dead 
I always take at least one blunt to the head 
Now always know -- cut off is gonna end up getting fucked 
And always know-- cut off is gonna end up getting stuck! 
I'm always strapped; I'm always cracked 
I've always rapped; it's always that 
Always black 

[Chorus x4]

[3rd Verse]

Never try to knock off rock on the block that ain't yours 
Never take a man's life cuz you hate yours 
Never become so involved with something that it blinds you 
Never forget where you from someone who reminds you 
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift 
And if I sleep on -- cut off left that nigga stiff 
Never turn your back on -- you don't trust 
Never turn your gat on -- and don't bust 
Never expect to give away with cent -- more than twice 
Never forget you could get it too for a price 
Never bring a two and -- if you scared to die 
Never gonna do it -- if you scared to drive 
Never gonna be another day it gets dark 
Never get it -- here for the heart 
Never say never, cuz I never thought, this never thought never 
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with doing better, Dmx! 

[Chorus x4]

Uhh Dmx
