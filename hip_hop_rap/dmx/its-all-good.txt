It's All Good 
Love my niggaz, but wheres my bitches 
I love my niggaz, but wheres my bitches 
Love my niggaz, but wheres my bitches 
I love my niggaz, but wheres my bitches 

[Chorus]

It's all good 
It's alright 
Fuck all day 
Fuck all night 
Call my bitches, cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the west coast, all my bitches 

Yo 
Chickens is good for plucking 
So I'm stickin' bitches, fuckin' 
Got 'em trickin' while they suckin' 
Give 'em dick and they ain't buggin' 
I've done it all 
From mackin' 2 hoes, on a three-way 
Dominican hoes on B day 
Country hoes in V-A 
And they all say 
The same about my game 
It's tight 
Thats why every night 
A different group of bitches start a fight 
Over some dick that they don't even own 
All I'm givin' them is the bone 
Blowin' up a niggaz phone 
But ain't nobody home 
I'm in a zone 
Tryin' to do things 
But turns into a cruel thing 
Whats up girlfriend, you game 
No wonder why 
When I leave at night 
It's cause I theive at night 
I'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right 
I fuck they head up with some slick shit 
Hit 'em off with some long dick shit 
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit 
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a thursday 
Knowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first day 

[chorus]

Flocks of bitches by the dozens 
From sisters to cousins 
Got 'em doin' shit they said they wasn't 
Ever gonna do 
Like knowin' I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to 
Still gave up the ass and dough 
She was supposed to 
Pictures of bitches 
And flicks of chicks 
Videos with the baddest hoes, sucking dick 
It's the dog in me that makes me do wrong 
 can't help but get strong 
Cause the game is too strong 
I like 'em greedy 
Black like edi 
Eyes beady 
Willin' to give to the needy 
I done ran through 'em all 
From around the way bitches 
Outta state hoes 
And even hitting gay bitches 
All I tell 'em is "let me get that" 
Then it's on 
Knock her mothafuckin' boots 
And then I'm gone 
I got the white bitches sayin' "It's a black thing" 
Cause I leave that hoe with no dough 
And plenty back pain 

[chorus]

Bitches who get props 
Cause they know who can get got 
And they can get shot 
By the way ya niggaz flip drop 
Walk up in the spot 
Knowin' what she want 
Strictly 
When hun wants the dickly 
Hun comes and gets me 
It's amazing 
Does it get crazy 
Known to be swayze 
Cause thats daddy's baby 
i keep them hoes in check 
Like the government 
Hittin' 'em off with nothin' but the dick 
Snd they lovin' it 
Huggin' it 
Like it's they best friend 
Cause it is 
Word to mix 
Fuckin' with tricks is just biz 
I deal with strictly dimes 
Got 'em commitin' they first crimes 
Cause she suckin' dick for the first time 
And ain't no secret 
'Bout how i freak it 
When it's sleek it 
Never knew how I peeped it 
Then creeped it 
That's how I know this must be that shit 
I tell them bitches "i'll be back" 
And they believe that shit 

[chorus x4]

Love my niggaz, but wheres my bitches 
I love my niggaz, but wheres my bitches 
[repeat x4]
