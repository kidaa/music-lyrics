[Talking] 
Please give me the strength I need to live... 
Bear with me 
Amen 

We each walk the path, that we've chosen 

[Chorus] 
I'm ready to meet him 
We're I'm living ain't right 
Black hate whit 
White hate black 
It's right back 
To the same fight 
They got us suspecting a war 
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord 

Lord, you left me stranded 
And I don't know why 
Told me to live my life 
Now I'm ready to die 
Ready to fly 
I cry, but I shed no tears 
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years 
Snakes still coming at me 
Just missing 
Sometimes I think all you doing me is just listen 
I thought that I was special 
Thats what you told me 
Hold me 
Stop acting like you don't know me 
What'd I do so bad that it sent you away from me 
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me 
My child I'm here, as I've always been, it was you who went away, 
And now are back again, what did I say 
Follow your word, and be true 
What did you do 
Well:what I wanted to do... 
What have you seen 
Darkness and hell at a glance 
What do you want 
All I want is another chance 

[Chorus]

Just because you went away, my doors are not locked, wanna come back home, all you gotta do is knock 
Ya see, I left home a boy, I returned as a man 
Full grown, and I'm still not able to stand 
I gave you a hand 
Well...but I was looking the wrong way 
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray 
And that prayer, took me from here to over there 
Back to over here 
Now they got me like where 
Do I belong 
Do I fit in 
Things on my mind, where do I begin 
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart 
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start 
Thou shall not steal 
But, what if he stole from me 
Thou shall not kill 
But what if he's tryin' to kill me 
Thou shall not, take my, name in vain, no matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain 

[Chorus]

Our father, who art in heaven 
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance, at 27 
No longer afraid to knock on your door 
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war 
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the lord 
Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword 
And now that I've seen, what I need to see 
Please take me, where I need to be 
What have you learned 
It's better to tell the truth than to lie 
What have you learned 
To love my life until I die 
What have you learned 
Violence isn't always the key 
What have you learned 
You can't always believe what you see 
What have you learned 
It's better to forgive and forget 
What have you learned 
Give as you expect to get 
What have you learned 
That I can't go on without you 
What have you learned 
I musta been a fool to ever doubt you 

[Chorus]

I'm ready to meet him
