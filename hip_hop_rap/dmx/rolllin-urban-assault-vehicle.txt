People in the house put them hands in the air 
Cuz if you don't care, than we don't care 
See I, aint givin a fuck, quit pressin your luck 
Untouchable, branded unfuckable 
So keep me in this tape, until you run that mouth 
Then I'ma hafta play, and break the fuck out 
And then we'll see you slept after one round wit X 
And what am I bringin next, just know it's Red and Meth 
So where the fuck you at punk, shut the fuck up 
And back the fuck up, while we fuck this track up

[HOOK]

[Method Man] 
Oh what, y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me 
Check my, dangerous slang atrocious 
When I let these nuts hang, focus, it's Wu Tang 
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish 
I wave my black flag at the roaches 
Who approaches, these twin, supersoakers 
Who have poisonous darts for culprits 
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered 
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted 
So what, I drink and smoke too much 
So what I cuss too much, *shut the fuck up!* 

[Redman] 
Yo, yo, now when we roll 
You motherfuckers tuck in your gold 
Cuz for the platinum, I'm jackin niggas up in limos 
It aint nothin, for bullets to unbutton your clothes 
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose 
You bitches, swing the vine on the bathroom nuts 
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattoed up 
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what 
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts 

[Method Man] 
My name is, Johnny, Donnie, Brasco 
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow 
Yell if you want money, funny 
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me 
Doc and Hot Niks, bodies in the mosh pit 

[Redman] 
Yo, and I'm the D.O., you lookin at the raw invented 
On Friday, I spit 35 to 40 minutes 
Smell up, the bathroom like Craig Paul was in it 
Endin up, on your back, Wu swords up in it 
Anyone can match me I crack 'em all to Guinness 
Fuck how many thugs, players, and ballers in it 
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners 
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it 
PPPPPPP P- P- POW! 
[AAAAAAAAAHH!] 
Yo we said c'mon!! 

[HOOK]

[DMX] It just don't get no darker than that kid with the barker 
Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark 
I'm a fair nigga, but aint nann nigga 
Quicker than the hand trigga, so if you dare nigga 
It'll be like your man tryin to hold your brain to your head 
But you'll be shittin on yourslef cuz you already dead 
And at the funeral you won't need a casket 
Leavin just enough of him to stuff in a basket 
Just get the casket, I really need my ass kicked 
My mom never let me forget, that I'm a bastard 
I aint never been shit, and aint gon' be shit 
That's why I taste shit, whenever I see shit 
It's just that D shit, D's short for do what I wanna do 
And that's what I'm gonna do, right here in front of you 
And I'll be runnin you and your man straight up out 
And y'all niggas aint runnin a fuckin thing but your mouth 

[DMX bark] 
AAAAAAAAHHH!!! 

[HOOK]

[Durst] 
You, wanna mess with Limp Bizkit [yeah] 
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit [why] 
Because we get it on, [when] every day and every night [oh] 
See this platinum thing right here [uh huh] 
Well we doin it all the time [what] 
So you better get some better beats 
And uh, get some better rhymes [oooh!] 
You really, really, really wanna get shit started 
Well people everywhere just get retarded 
Get retarded, get retarded, people everywhere just get retarded!
