[Verse One]
Hey yo D, it's your nigga D
Uh-huh
What the fuck, you forgot about me
You've been eatin real good lately
Didn't get a shout out on your last album, what you hate me
Arrrf
Said I was your dog
Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Arrrf
Said I was your mans and them
And any problem that you had I would handle them
Aiyyo dog it's like this, I fuck with you lightly uh-huh
Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep you'd bite me uhh
Get mad at me, send niggaz wantin to fight me uhh
Whole time you fucked with me you didn't like me
Oh where you hear that
Pssh, niggaz talk
Plus you know how shit flow in New York
Walls have ears, buildings heard
Supposed to be shhhhhh but spill the word

[Chorus]
Everywhere that I go, everything that I see
Every place that I touch I feel him fuckin with me
I'm gonna fly.. arrrf
Why you lie  Feel me get with Ryde or Die
I'm gonna fly.. arrrf
Eye for an eye - what happened to my piece of the pie

[Verse Two]
Now dog, you know me better than that
I could put you ahead of the pack, instead of the back
I could have niggaz sellin tapes, instead of the crack
Could have niggaz fallin down, with lead in they back
Ain't much that I can't do when I want to
I don't really need you, nigga fuck you
WHAT!
Nah I'm just playin, got a wife and kids
Little Dame ain't come across dem triflin kid
Yo what you mean by that
Mean by what
Youse a grimy nigga f'real, I see whassup
I don't even know why I fucked with you from the door
Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more
I coulda got it from him
But you woulda hate to wait
But I wouldn't have the weight
C'mon, don't hate
What happened to the right hand, Light Man
Nah that's Dark Man
Well let's get it right then

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now I see for who you are, it's like I know you uh-huh
So I can't trust you as far as I can throw you uhh
Oh you, don't know you are the reason
that I go through what I go through, let me show you
Didn't I promise you again, to slight your friends
Countin these pairs of Timbs, these endless ends
But what did it cost me c'mon
My life to be taken softly, man BACK THE FUCK UP OFF ME
Don't fuck with me like that when I fuck witchu like this
Don't come at me like that when you know that you might miss
Go on about your business
If any cat you send me way, ain't gon' be no witness
LORD JESUS
C'mon dog, look who you're fuckin
PLEASE HELP ME
Whassup dog  Man you buggin
KEEP THE DEVIL
Thug life, thought we were tight
OUT OF MY LIFE
I'll be back aight  Psych

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
