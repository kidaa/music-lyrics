Y'all been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
fuck around and I'm go'a bite you and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me 
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever 
The closest thing to me is gonna get it
but, never Will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boone
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin mother fuckers, stay on the floor
4-4, that's what I get sick wit rrrrrrr
Four more, now all this is liquid rrrrrr

I thank the lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm The best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the dog house leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin
But I don't like drama so I say to myself,
 Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses 
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish with a cat 
Two glowin red eyes, everything else is black

When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge, With the buck shots, faggot
You've been lucky all day thats when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, go into you and your mother
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by 
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, Why ask why when you know
Nigga when its your time to go, You go
