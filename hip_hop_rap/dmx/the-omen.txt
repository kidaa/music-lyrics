[Barking] 
You, right here shorty, told you, I got you 
Like the way I scooped you, when those fagget niggaz shot you 
I'ma hold you down, and I mean that, for real 
But everytime you beef with a nigga, I end up havin' to kill 
Ain't like that, and hey, forget about them 2 kids 
'Bout to do a deal, somethin' nice as you is 
Oh you think 
Nah, I'm just playin', what's up 
I got some new bitches, I know you tryin' to fuck 
Not really 
What I ain't your man no more 
Because a nigga, don't need a hand no more 
You know how we do, if one goes sore 
You'll take the pussy and go up in the roar 
It's like now 
Where you goin' 
I ain't trying to take it 
Fuckin' with a nigga like you, I won't make it 
It'll be what it is 
Yo, you in for the night 
I'm 'bout to take it to the crib 
You get home alright 

[Chorus - Marilyn Manson] 
The snake 
The rat 
The cat and the dog 
How you gonna live 
When you're in the fog 

[Dmx] 
Yo 
I ain't fuckin' with this nigga, no more 
Word to my mother 
Fuck 'em, so ya know 'em for sure 
Word to my brother 
It's like he's gotten worse than before 
Son of I wonder 
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under 
Then I get a call 
Yo! 
X, Luis just killed your cousin, underneath the projects 
Don't get back, them niggaz will pay, then I got you, told you I got you 
Yo, I got you 
I'm in a catch 22 
But them niggaz gotta pay 
But I know he's gonna be askin' for a favor one day 
But fuck it 
I ain't got no choice in the matter 
Them faggets killed my peep 
And I wanna see him splatter 
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, we ain't on no bitch hit 
And use the same gun that you killed them 2 kids with 
Is that hard to live with 
Nah 
See, you still a playa 
But what you want from me 
Uh...I'll tell you later 

[Chorus]

Shit is all over the news 
Bomb goes off in central 
What the fuck have I gotten myself into 
My mental is like 
Get the fuck outta there 
I'm out 
Hey, goin' somewhere 
Nah 
What the bag for 
Fuck it, what you want 
Can a nigga come inside for a minute, and puff a blunt 
Here we go again 
After what I just gave you, with you actin' like that 
when you asked for that favor 
Yo, I ain't ask you for shit 
Oh yes you did, when you really needed something, and you was out, you did 
You sold me your soul, when you didn't say no 
Just let a nigga go, and give me what you owe 
Fuck what you think, ain't shit for free 
And a mothafucker you know, can't defeat me 
Forgive me father, for I have sinned 
And with your help I know, the devil won't win 

[Marilyn Manson] 

Here we are on our way to hell 
We're gonna do it, and we do it well 

This is Marilyn Manson, Dmx, Ruff Ryders
