Uh, uh, uh 
Niggaz gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about 
Suckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in they mouth 
And then I snuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did 
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid 
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that 
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that 
Where ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit 
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets 
Bits, and pieces are all thats that left 
Niggaz so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath 
til I pass, cause they asked/assed, and I smelled em 
The S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em 
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head 
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead 
Red alert, niggaz is about to get hurt, do work 
to skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF 
Night time is the right time for creepin 
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin 
I been off the deep end, since I was semen 
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon! 
SCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off 
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off 
a couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven 
That's about eleven hundred as of now 
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and 
the-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20 *sing-song like Nice and Smooth* 
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot 
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot 
Fat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with 
the jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools 
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin 
Niggaz caught me tail end cause the weight that I be sewin 
shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE 
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state 
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different 
You turn around you ask the nigga, "The FUCK is you be sniffin" 
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin 
Gots to say nuttin, niggaz know they get had 

Motherfucker, Funk Flex, volume three, the final chapter 
Ruff Ryders, Irv Gotti, Def Jam.. 
Right here, where my dogs at 
Got them all for you baby I got them all 
I gots them all..
