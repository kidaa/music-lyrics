[Intro: Jay-Z]
Whut the Fuck

Bitches, Ya'll ready for this 
Ha, alright. Let's bounce 

[Verse 1: Jah Rule]
I'm startin' to flow

That's what niggaz wit do do, yo 
Red means stop, Green means go 
Right now I see green 
You wanna stop 
Oh No 
What are you anyway nigga, Friend or Foe 
Don't Fuck wit me, or I-N-C 
Nigga, what the fuck, are you crazy 
Can't believe dat shit, tryin' act swayze 
You'd be better off lazy 
So shut the fuck up right now, and maybe 
Murder I-N-C will show mercy 
Cuz first b 
We don't fuck wit' dem, uninterested niggaz 
You know who I'm talkin about 
Those niggaz that started to bust out 
Soon as our first joint came out 
Holla Holla, if I could have a Dolla 
for every Nigga that hated me soon as I-N-C was on Blaze 
But I don't give a fuck 
I said not a flying Fuck 
Ja Rule, Murder I-N-C, make ya say Whut Whut 

[Hook: Jay-Z, Ja Rule, and DMX]
The Murder I-N-C

Whenever the I-N-C is in town [3x]

Gonna fuck you up, just cause they like to 
How the fuck you gonna fuck around wit' organized crime 
God damn, we live what we speak in every fuckin' rhyme

Now, back to this murder shit 
Light my fuse, my teeth begin to grit 
Party wit' my crew, fuck you 
You ain't playin' wit no screw, or a smack

Anything bad I do or say, cause yo that shit is wack 
And I just luv when you niggaz bring your whole crew 
It's just sme more beef to stick you to 
and Fuck You, now it's plain to see, 
It ain't to smart fuckin' wit' Murder I-N-C 

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Dem Niggaz ain't prepared 
For dis shit we prepared 
got every nigga scared 
cause of all the fuckin' shit that we shared 
And don't none of them niggaz 
wanna fuck around 
We're never gonna find a common ground 
Many niggaz wanna know, does murder sound like this 
We're three Hip-Hop Philanthrapists 
but, we don't give no muney, we don't give a fuck so... 
When the light is green 
It's time to go 
I don't care who you know 
You still payin' full price, to our show 
Fuck no, I won't give 'em to you free or with a discount yo 
Cuz 
You ain't gettin' nada from us 
Cause niggaz always get a lotta money from us 
That ain't the thug way 
Nigga, don't try and play 
Hold the fuck up, are you gay 
No 
Well anyway 
It's time to say 
final goodbyes 
and one more thing, this shit I just rapped about 
and none of it are lies 
Next step is to come in, fuck your boo 
when I'm through 
all she'll be able to say is Jigga Whut Jigga Who 
and ask her who her man is 
she'll tell you 
She'll put her finga on the trigga 
pull and yell Jigga my Nigga
