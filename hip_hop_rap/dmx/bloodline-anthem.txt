I like my blunts heavily hashed, bitches heavily assed
Joints ready to stash, got 'em ready to blast WHAT!
Give 'em plenty and pass, the thing off woo! toss that
Get pulled over, we already lost that, of course black uh!
Floss that, lose that, get that  Come up off that
You ain't choose that, but you with that, now spit back c'mon
Y'all niggaz got me all wrong WHAT!

But when I come back, c'mon dog, respect my slot UHH
Ain't no get in where I fit in, bitch I'm straight to the top aight
And whoever don't like it, FUCK YOU FAGGOT, bring it! WHAT!

I don't play with you cats like I used to
Cause well I ain't your father uh-huh
This time it's gon' be a little harder
Told niggaz to "Do You", courtesy of Flex
Put out "... And Then There Was X" and then there was X
And then there was X again, ain't my next of kin
Just some hardheaded dickridin grown-ass men uhh, uhh
C'mon with the bullshit WHAT! please, don't touch that
You might, bust yo' gun dog but we bust back aight
And what's that, a lot of dead homies

Respect the nine or catch a wreckless twenty-nine ahh
For every bone in your spine ahh make a nigga recline ahh

Peep niggaz starin, but they don't want NUTTIN
