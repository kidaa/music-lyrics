Shut 'em down [4x]

[Verse 1:]

Yo shut 'em down start the violence 
We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found 
Washed up on Coney Island 
When I rolled up, this niggas heart slowed up 
That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump 
Thirty-two shots and ducked out 
So look out 
Left that cat for dead his body smoked out 
Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid 
I'm goin' all out 
Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it 
Gmae play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted 
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest 
Have you layin' with a dead rest 
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death 
And I swore forgiveness when I did this 
there was not no witness but he should understand 
Cause even God got a shit list 

[Verse 2:]
Beat downs anonymous 
I spit like a shiny silver nanabus 
Niggas fond of us 
We the kind that rush, those that hold back 
Takin' your whole stack 
Grimy street cats 
Niggas bald head like Kojak 
Go gat for gat 
Coat that 
You could smoke that 
Or cut black dust 
Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack 
Betta know me 
1-3, one and only could be never phoney in any ceremony 
I'l tear you homey 
Shut 'em down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em down 
Shun sees takin' your time 
Makin' your mind 
Got this nigga on the low 
defecatin' with rhymes 
Breakin' your spine 
Got you movin' from the flurry, time to worry 
I'ma bury the bullshit 
I'ma bury the bullshit 
I'ma bury the bullshit 
Feel my full clip 

[Hook] 

[Verse 3: DMX] 
Aiyyo I bet you this muthafuckin' double barrel will blast his face 
Be on the look out for a basket case 
Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat 
Had you thinkin' shits sweet 
Now you up shit's creek 
Cause your shits weak 
How mich is your life worth to someone important 
Cause I be extortin' 
Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in 
From back in the days of Gordon 
Niggas was gettin' robbed 
The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job 
with his own little mob 
Was it worth goin back to the Earth so soon 
Worth makin' my shit go boom 
To your own doom, from the graveyards 
Till there's no room 
Fuck you know about a pine box 
Money goin' out with nine Glocks 
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots 
Feel like killin' for your crew 
I ain't gon' rest 
It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best 
Then watch your loins spill out your vest 
You best get on some act your age shit 
you a little kid 
That run for faces 
More niggas get killed like that
