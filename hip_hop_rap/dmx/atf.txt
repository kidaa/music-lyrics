[DMX] 
Got me on the run 
Uh, uh 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, open the door, ATF 
To late to send my girl downstairs to say he left 
To the basement, go through the replacement door 
Come up in my neighbor's yard, wit' a taste for war 
You know I laced the four, wit' the hallows 
Crack the safe, got the bottles 

[Girl] 
Whatchu want me to do 

[DMX] 
Beep Callows 
Two houses over, by the tall black fence 
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this 
There go Priest, yo, deal in, you drive 

[Guy] 
What the fuck you doin' nigga 

[DMX] 
Tryin' to stay alive 
Cops on every corner, I lay back and try to cruise by 
Who the fuck could'a snitched Must'a been a new guy 
SirenDamn, in back on our ass 
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast 
Tryin' to pull up on the side, but I'm packin' to blast 
Tryin' to take the niggaz heads off, fuck crackin' the glass 
GunshotsHey, look out, bark, damn 
Came so close, you almost hit that bitch 

[Guy] 
Like you said nigga, almost 

[DMX] 
Shit, the cops hit her, and I know they ain't gon' leave her 
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather 
breathing sounds 
Drop it on the floor, BOOM 
Got it through the door, peddle to the floor, an office line 
Death is in the air, and I don't know if it's mine 
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is 
And all I can think of is what about my kids 
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick! 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips 
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout 
Run through the fire, pull a gun from my boot out 
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear 
I'm goin' out fast and the last thing I hear is 
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, open the door, ATF
