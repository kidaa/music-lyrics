Baby I got many problems
But my momma won't help me solve them
So I come to you you
But your ass don't wanna be bother
So I come around trying to be down
But you acting like a silly clown
Asking me for $50..
Saying to myself "I Be Damned!"

Why you trying to give me such a 
Very very hard time
When I spend the money on you 
I Can't get a little Bump 'n Grind
It must be another man
Holding your hand hand
Please tell me baby baby
I will understand

[Ginuwine:]
I'm tryin to go on with out you here
In my life
I don't wanna except the fact the you're
No longer mine
Just to know that somebody else is 
Holding and Kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like
I'm a fool
sooooo.....

[Chorus:]
I'll do Anything
Anything you want
Yes my word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me 
For what I've Done
I'm Sorry

all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes I am

I'll do Anything
Anything you want
Yes my word is bond mm hm
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me yes
For what I've Done
I'm Sorry

[2nd Verse:]
I'm trying to take over these emotions
everyday day
I realize it's to late now
you're gone away
Is there something that I can do
to reasure
That I won't hurt you like this 
anymore
sooo......anything....

[Chorus]
mm..hmm
Oooh
Please forgive me
Baby what do I have to do
Hmmm
I'm begging you on bended knee

[Bridge:]
I'll Do Anything I'll so anything
That's my Word is Bond and that's my word is bond
Please forgive me Can't you tell
I'm sorry Can't you tell by the look in my eye

I'll Do Anything 
That's my Word is Bond 
Please forgive me Please, Please forgive G'
I'm sorry everything I've done...I'm sorry baby

[Chorus 2x]

[fade out....]
