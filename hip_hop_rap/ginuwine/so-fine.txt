She's so fine, fine, fine
She's a dime, dime, dime
She's so fine, fine, fine
She's all mine, mine, mine

She can make you lose control, but I'm a keep it on the low
Just to see her pretty face makes you want her want her
Can't explain the way it feels, but I know the feelings real
I can't wait to get her home so I can love her

She's so fine, fine, fine
She's a dime, dime, dime
She's so fine, fine, fine
She's all mine, mine, mine

She's the only one for me, treat her like she's supposed to be
Love her from her head to toe, she's my boo, girl boo girl
Give her everything she likes - even bought her all her ice
Ain't nothing that I won't do 'cause I love her

She's so fine, fine, fine
She's a dime, dime, dime
She's so fine, fine, fine
She's all mine, mine, mine

Look:You'll she's the beautifulest thing to me
If you don't believe just take one look
When you do you see you will be hooked
You can't deny, she's the baddest thing and OH SO FINE
If you don't believe just take one look
When you do, you see you will be hooked
