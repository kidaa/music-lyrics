[Intro:]
You know what, baby
I need to tell you something
And...it's something very important
You know...
I want you to take this time out and just listen
And hole me close
You hear me
Listen

Can I have you for a minute
Don't get shy 'cuz my heart's in it When I say
You got me strung out
I don't know and I can't call it
But whatever it is you've got it Naw babe
Without a doubt, yeah
Never been the one to cling 
And I don't like to be needed But now
I guess that's all changed
That's why I get mad at your phones 
'Cuz I don't want you to go Naw babe
I want you to stay

[Chorus:]
You can say I'm trippin' but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you all to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it
You're the only one, with the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me, I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me

[Verse 2:]
Listen Baby, tell me how you do it 
'Cuz you got me so into it
I'm gone, but I don't understand
So amazing, captivating, elevating 
Any way you try to put it I wanna be your man
So if you if you wanna put me on
I don't mind it's alright, I'm for it
I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on more than being with you
Baby, I'm not trippin'

[Chorus:]
You can say I'm trippin' but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you all to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it
You're the only one, with the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me, I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me

Do what you want
Anything, anything
I am all yours
You can do no wrong
Everything, everything 
I do because I'm so wide open

No joking, you got me right where you want me to be
I just hope you feel the same
'Cuz I don't want nothing to change
This is where I wanna be
So if you wanna put me on
I don't mind it's alright, I'm for it
I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on better than being with you
Baby, I'm not trippin'

[Chorus 2x]
You can say I'm trippin' but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you close to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it
You're the only one, with the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me, I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me
