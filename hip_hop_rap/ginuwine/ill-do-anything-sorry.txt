Timbaland: 

Baby I got many problems 
But my momma won't help me solve them 
So I come to you you 
But your ass don't want to be bother 
So I come around trying to be down 
But you acting like a silly clown, askin me for $50.... 
Saying to myself "I Be Damned!" 

Why you trying to give me such a 
Very very hard time 
When I spend the money on you 
I can't get a little bump and grind 
It must be another man 
Holding your hand hand 
Please tell me baby baby 
I will understand 

Ginuwine: 

I'm tryin to go on with out you here 
In my life 
I don't want to except the fact that you're 
No longer mine 
Just to know that somebody else is 
Holdin and Kissing you 
It makes a guy like me feel like 
I'm a fool 
soooo....... 

Chorus: 

I'll Do Anything 
Anything you want 
Yes my word is bond 
Baby I was wrong 
Please forgive me 
For what I've done 
I'm Sorry 


all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes I am 

I'll Do Anything 
Anything you want 
Yes my word is bond mm hm 
Baby I was wrong 
Please forgive me yes 
For what I've done 
I'm Sorry 

2nd Verse: 

I'm trying to take over these emotions 
everyday day 
I realized it's too late now 
you're gone away 
Is there something that I can do 
to reasure 
That I won't hurt you like this 
anymore
soooo.......anything......

*Chorus*
mm..hmm
Oooh
Please forgive me 
Baby what do I have to do 
Hmmm 
I'm begging you on bended knee 

Bridge: 

I'll Do Anything  I'll do anything 
That's my word is bond and that's my word is bond 
Please forgive me Can't you tell 
I'm Sorry Can't you tell by the look in my eye 

I'll Do Anything 
That's my word is bond 
Please forgive me Please, please forgive G' 
I'm Sorry everything I've done...I'm sorry baby 

Chorus 2x 

fade out....
