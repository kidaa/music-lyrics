[Chorus]
I'm gonna make it happen 
Ginuwine 4 Ur Mind [x3]
I'm gonna make it happen 
Ginuwine one time 

I wanted to tell you how I feel 
So you can know the real deal 
I want me a lady 
So I can carry on cuz my love is strong 
Run deeper than the water's deep 
Tell me baby can you get with me 
I'm lookin' for someone whose down 
to have my back and always stay around 

[Chorus]
It's Ginuwine 4 Ur Mind 
Can you feel me 
I'm gonna make it happen every time 

Come with me coz I'm scoping you 
Only I can do the things I do 
Fill you up until you say when 
I'll take you round the world 
And we'll go back again 
 I'm feelin' big cuz I've got much to give 
 I satisfy cuz that's the way I live 
You're dealin with a real man 
And only things can do the things I can 

[Chorus]
Ginuwine 
You 
Ginuwine 4 Ur Mind 

[Bridge]
Give me just 1 chance 
I'll fulfill your needs 
I'm just a real 'G' 
Can you get with me
