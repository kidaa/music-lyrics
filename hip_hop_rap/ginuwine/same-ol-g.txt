From Dr. Dolittle Soundtrack

verse I 
the only time I drink a 40 is when I wanna drink a 40 
and usually when I wear a suit 
I leave with not one but two 
I'm not trying to hurt nobody 
you only live once they told me 
you can't be mad at me 
I can just be  G  

chorus: 
even though I got my own c.d. 
maybe even on T.V. 
there ain't no changing me 
I can only be me me me 
even though I might be on T.V. 
cause I got my own CD 
all you will ever see 
same ol'  G  

Verse II 
I used to be the main one clubbin 
but now I choose to stay at home 
most of my friends still thuggin 
this time the  G s full grown 
I'm thinking 'bout my future lately 
whatever that may be 
but now it's clear to me 
I can just be  G  

chorus: 

Timbaland: 
hello ya'll 
yeah this that Timbaland coming to ya one mo 'gain 
you see, people say that we're changing 
but really it's the people around us that are changing 
you see, we aint tryna hurt nobody 
people tryna hurt us 
but you know what 
I'ma keep being me 
that's all I can do in this life time check it 

Ginuwine: 
day after day 
I continue to be 
me oh me 
that's all I can be 
oooh day after day 
I continue to be me oh me 
thatsame ol'  G
