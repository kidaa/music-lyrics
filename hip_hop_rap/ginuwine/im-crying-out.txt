Can't believe you're gone
Can't believe you're gone

[Chorus:]
What did I do the deserve this pain,
I'm crying out
I'm so alone without you here
What's this about
[Repeat]

[1st Verse:]
I can't go on, 
I need you here right next to me
My life ain't complete,
I'm dying inside I feel so weak
I'm puring out my heart to you
Feel my pain it hurts so deep
There's no need to go ahead
My life is gone, I'd rather be dead

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse:]
I'm still amazed
Despite everything I still have love
What's keep the feelings deep within in me
I thought they'd be easy to get rid of
There's no one I'm wanting more
You're the reason why I love, yeah
I'd give anything just to have you girl
Cuz you make you whole, you are my world

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Can't believe you're gone
Are you coming back
Tell me what I've done
But I love you so...
[Repeat]

What did I do to deserve this pain, I'm crying out....

[Timbaland Talking:]
Hello baby...why you got my man cryin out....That's not a nice thing to
do...You know, he loves you. But you know what, I love you too. Don't hurt
him baby.
