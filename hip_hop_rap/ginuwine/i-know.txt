[1st Verse:]
I caught your eye looking my way
But you seem so shy
Don't be scared, I won't hurt you
And darlin' that's no lie
Believe I can do things to you, you never dreamed
I won't give up till you posses, in life the finer things

[Chorus:]
I know, know what you do want
Honey stop the fakin'
Come on and get with me baby, drive me crazy
Feel me, hold me, love me, squeeze me
[Repeat]

[2nd Verse:]
With you it seems to be
Me you want, but you've been hurt
I lived those days so you know, I want just one and only one
Playin the field seems foul to me, If you have love to give
In life there is no time to waste, and that's not the way to live

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Be my lady
I'll never treat you wrong
Drive my Mercedez
All that I have, you can own
You're so precious
You're my queen
You're my baby
You're my baby

[Chorus till fade]
