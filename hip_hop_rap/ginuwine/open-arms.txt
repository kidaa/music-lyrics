MMMmmmm yeah
Hey hey
MMMmmmm

Listen baby, it's been a while since I've talked to you 
And you've talked to me
So this song is especially for you and I
Listen closely baby

Why can't we sit by the fireplace and play love with you
I wanna read your mind and see if you're thinking about me
It's been a while since I've sat down and expressed the way that I feel
But I'm about to cry cause it's too late and the pain is real
And it's too much to bare and I'm so awfully scared
I need someone who feels me
I need someone who loves me

Why do I stay a while with you
We can give back what we've been through
To one another to each other
There's nothing I'll keep from you
Why don't you reach and grab my hand
I'll be the one who understands
You can count on me
I won't do you wrong
I'll be here with open arms
You can count on me
I'll be here with open arms

The way that you were talking you
Telling me that you're just so hurt so hurt
You're insinuations are screaming to me
That you're really hurt so hurt
I wanna be a mechanic and fix everything that is wrong
For you to be crying and feeling so down baby that's so wrong
And it's too much to bare yeah
You seem so awfully scared
You need someone who feels you
You need someone who loves you

Why do I stay a while with you
We can give back what we've been through
To one another to each other
There's nothing I'll keep from you
Why don't you reach and grab my hand
I'll be the one who understands
You can count on me
I won't do you wrong
I'll be here with open arms

We'll need no more
Without each other and not willing more
No pain just love
With you that's all I see and nothing 'cause
And for you I'll give my right and left arm
I'll forever be a man who won't do you wrong
Forever love you that's no question
You're the one girl I'm confessing

Why do I stay a while with you
We can give back what we've been through
To one another to each other
There's nothing I'll keep from you
Why don't you reach and grab my hand
I'll be the one who understands
You can count on me
I won't do you wrong
I'll be here with open arms
You can count on me
I'll be here with open arms
You can count on me
I'll be here with open arms

Oh yes I will yes I will
I'll be here with o-pen arms.
