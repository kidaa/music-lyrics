Come here shorty, hey 
Girl you're lookin' fine 
I heard your searchin' for a real love 
And I'm really Ginuwine 
I come to move your body, hey 
Keep it jumpin' like a party, hey 
Come on everybody 
were gonna do it my way 

*Chorus* 
It's a G thang, hey 
Came to party till the break of dawn 
Watch my speakers bang 
Until daylight comes and we wanna go home 

I like me a buzz hey, hey 
But I don't want to smoke a weed 
Why smoke a box of Philly Plums 
When she can get high on G 
Go pick up a girlfriend 
They can ride in my benz 
Cause I'm taking everybody 
Where G likes to party 

*Chorus* 

*Bridge* 
set it off on the left ya'll 
set if off on the right ya'll 
set it off 
set it off by subjection 
set it off on the right ya'll 
set it off, set it off
