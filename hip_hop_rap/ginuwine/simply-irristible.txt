Simply Irrisitible 

Oh, oh yeah baby 
Oh, oh, yeah, oh 
Hotter than New Orleans 
In summertime you're so fine 
You walk by now I wish I could press rewind 
You shining like a disco ball 
I can't say no 
Can't say no 
We probably could break some laws 
And not be wrong 

1 - Simply irresistible 
That is you, that is me 
Can't wait to get physical 
I want you, you want me 
Now it's getting critical 
I need you, you need me 
I'm so tired of typical 
And that ain't you, that ain't me 

Picture us in Florida 
In the big beach house, full moon out, hey 
We probably would melt the couch 
When we sit down 
And probably take it to the floor 
Back and forth back and forth 
We light up the room like we had a torch 

Trust me when I tell you 
I anticipate us as one 
Next we'll break to see your face 
See my face, I'm for real 
My good taste and your good shape 
They relate no question 
Hold my hand, I'll hold your waist 
We'll be straight face to face 

Repeat 1 2x 

Hotter than New Orleans 
At twelve o'clock we so high 
We turn heads at every spot 
With what we've got 
What we've got 
I know we got something good, something real 
Us as one, just ain't fair 
No way cause we're 

Repeat 1 till end
