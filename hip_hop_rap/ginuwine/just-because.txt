Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because,boo,I got game,doesn't
mean I'll forget your name 
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a playa like me,could treat 
you like a lady ....... Just Because

Hearing my name every other day, 
people gonna say what they wanna say
But they don't really know me babe,
hate on me 'cause a brother paid
Only known you for a short time, things that you're 
hearing weighing on my mind
If you feel me, here's what I suggest, let
me put your fears to rest

Baby I admit it, I usrd to, hit it and
I quit it 
But I' trying to, learn to be committed, to 
you and only, I'm your man

I can understand why you're insecure, doing 
all I can just to reassure
Seeing all these women at my stage door, screaming
'G' is the one that we're here for
I know if we go by my history, this might be 
hard to believe 
But they don't mean a thing to me, I am
still the same ol' 'G'

Baby I admit it, I usrd to, hit it and
I quit it 
But I' trying to, learn to be committed, to 
you and only, I'm your man

Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't

Just because,boo,I got game,doesn't

Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip

You're the one I wanted, 'cause them 
other chicks 
Couldn't much on it, see you kept it real 
So you're gonna get rewarded, no doubt,
I'm your man... check it out

Baby I admit it, I usrd to, hit it and
I quit it 
But I' trying to, learn to be committed, to
