Why not me
Is that I'm too ghetto for you
Why not me
Girl there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me
I'm here to give you all you dreams
I'm dedicated
No time wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

It ain't a thang
I'm far from lame
Girl it's all to the good
You're playing hard to get now
That's probably why you're by yourself now
But I caught your eye when you walked by
And you persist to try to entertain
All of them thing that you probably just heard
None of it's true and that' my word
Baby don't believe a thing you hear
The haters are always on my back now
But you feel me and this I know
So won't you just let go 
Tell me why

Why not me
Is that I'm too ghetto for you
Why not me
Girl there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me
I'm here to give you all you dreams
I'm dedicated
No time wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

I'd like o think that I am a good guy so tell me why
Not me
Can't blame you though if all you're ex-
Boyfriends did you shady
But don't take that out on me girl
Oops I got to take it back it's your world
Baby I'm just that guy I'll show you why
If you just give me one try
I'm telling you I don't get down like that

Can't play the role
Or play myself
I just got to get in that's for sure
Got a little money
I spit game to the honeys
But your all a nigga needs
I won't give you chicken feed

Why not me
Is that I'm too ghetto for you
Why not me
Girl there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me
I'm here to give you all you dreams
I'm dedicated
No time wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

You should tell me something, something
Can't imagine me just wanting
Put your cards out on the table
Baby I'm willing and able
Picture that me dippin on you
What the use if I'm up on ya
I'm the one you searched so long for
Give me one chance you'll want no more

Why not me
Is that I'm too ghetto for you
Why not me
Girl there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me
I'm here to give you all you dreams
I'm dedicated
No time wasting
I'll fulfill your every need
