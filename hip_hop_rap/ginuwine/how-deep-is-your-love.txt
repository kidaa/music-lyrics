How deep is your love girl let's get serious
How deep is your love girl I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl can I fall in it
How deep is your love girl can I get close to it

We've kicked it for a little while you know
I think it's time for us to start to move ahead
We both been patient and that's cool and all
But I'm in need of you and you don't seem to even care
We've been in slow mo
Never swung an episode
So what's man to do
Stay or go cheat on you
Tell me baby what are you so scared of
I'll be real gentle when I'm making love to you

There ain't a thing you can't get from me
Whether it's ice, money come what may
I did everything you asked of me
But you must simply do not feel the same way
How longer do you need
Can't you easily see that I'm the one for you
Tell me what I should do
Whoever hurt you made it rough for me
But you are you, I am me, he was he

This love can't go unspoken
You got me wishing, hoping
You must let your judge lout
We've been through it all before now
This time we make that move now
Somewhere, somewhere, and somehow
Let's not play, not yo games
Don't live, die - don't live die
We're too grown
