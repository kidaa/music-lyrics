Yes, I've been through a lot of things and 
I lost my mom and I lost my dad and the pain 
never goes away and there are only two reasons that I cry 

Two reasons I cry 
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone 
And I'm all alone - I'm so all alone 
There are two reasons I cry 
Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's gone 
And my heart is torn - I'm so all alone 
There are two reasons I cry 
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone 
There are two 

Daddy I miss you, it's hard to cope with my life 
Didn't want to go on without you daddy Still at night I cry 
I still can't understand why did you have to leave me 
Why couldn't I just have seen all your pain - now I blame myself 
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, cause when your parents 
Are gone it's hard to believe 
That is part of life - that you must go on 
They would want you to still be strong 

Two reasons I cry 
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone 
And I'm all alone - I'm so all alone 
There are two reasons I cry 
Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's gone 
And my heart is torn - I'm so all alone 
There are two reasons I cry 
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone 
There are two 

Momma when you left, felt like my soul had gone 
I still remember the day, had no words to say my heart was gone 
Still at night I cry 
You were the reason I lived, you gave me life that was pure 
Always kept me so sure of everything - I miss you so 
I looked down on you and no one ever knew I almost took my life 
So I could be with you - I miss you so, one could never know 
And I am lost and I'm feelin' so alone 

Two reasons I cry 
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone 
And I'm all alone - I'm so all alone 
There are two reasons I cry 
Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's gone 
And my heart is torn - I'm so all alone 
There are two reasons I cry 
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone 
There are two
