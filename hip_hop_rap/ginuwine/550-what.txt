Timbaland: 
Chillin' on the corna' wit my man Ginuwine 
Speakin about my problems 
Speakin about what's on mah mind 
Neva had a true reason whether I'mma be a hit or leavin 
Neva had an adress 
My life aint been nuttin but a F'in mess 
Talkin to to a whole lot of people 
Tellin me that my life is not gon' be creative eitha 
But my man Jafar 
He had a bunch of plans 
Ran to JD he ??? the plan 
Then what what Michael Capriland 
He hooked us up with Polly and he signed the G man 
Back to the basis 
L West had to let my legal statement 
She means so much to me 
She hooked us up with Ron Sweeni 
Workin together as a team 
Tryin to make the address complete our dreams 
As it seems 
Life cannot be defined in many 
There will be situations messin life's ??? candies 
To the left to the right 
550 baby, ya all right. 


I've been searching for so long 
I've been searching for so long 
I've been searching for so long 
I've been searching for so long
