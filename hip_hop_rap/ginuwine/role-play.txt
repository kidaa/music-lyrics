Let's play a little game; a forte'
Here's a little fantasy and roleplay
No lips ever the same
so let's play
a little fantasy and roleplay

Come right in 
and take off your skirt
Sit right down and let 'G' go to work
'Cause, being my patient 
has its perks
Come and show the doctor 
exactly where it hurts
You say the pain 
it hurts right there 
So come and lay it down 
right over here
You see with me, 
the fun will never end
Playin' my little game of roleplay pretend

Let's play a little game; a forte'
Here's a little fantasy and roleplay
No lips ever the same
so let's play
a little fantasy and role play

Take 2
Come right in with the handcuffs on 
I planned a lot of kinky stuff 
to the break of dawn
Were' gonna do it nice and rough 
'til your fears are gone
I'm a be the one to flip it up and rub it down 
and that's my wore, its bond
'Cause I'm your master 
and you're my slave
everything I say you will obey
You see with me, 
the fun will never end
Playin' my little game of roleplay pretend

Let's play a little game; a forte'
Here's a little fantasy and roleplay
No lips ever the same
so let's play
a little fantasy and roleplay

Now I can be your cowboy
Ride in my rodeo
I can be your dancer, baby
See my exotic show
I can be your teacher
And you can be my pet
Or I can be you director, baby
Get nake on the movie set
Whatever your fantasy, whatever your dream
Just set the stage, girl and let's start the scene
Tonight's the night I'm gonna give into you
The way you wish those other guys would do

Let's play a little game; a forte'
Here's a little fantasy and roleplay
No lips ever the same
so let's play
a little fantasy and roleplay
Let's play a little game; a forte'
Here's a little fantasy and roleplay
No lips ever the same
so let's play
a little fantasy and roleplay

Let's play a little game
fantasy and roleplay
