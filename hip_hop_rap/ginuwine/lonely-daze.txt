Oh Oh....
Can We Try...
Oh...

[Chorus 2x]
Can we try to make up for the Lonely daze
I love you baby come what may
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

Listen....
Sit back relax your mind your dinner is waiting
The more I see you girl my heart beat is pacing
New lovers mentally we knew what we were thinking
No waiting all night long let's start the love making
Can we try....

[Chorus 2x]

Cause I love you
I'm gonna make you stay
Can we try

One chance is all I need to have you forever
I'll wait forever girl until the 12th of never
If I could do it all I'd carry your baby...nine months long
But I'm a man no doubt Darlin'
And you are my lady

[Chorus 2x]

Can we try
To make up for the lonely daze 
I'm gonna make you stay
all the things I wanna do to you baby

I'm tryin to figure out
what this love thing is all about 
Can we be as one
Help me to know your so fine baby be mine
I wanna tell you girl
It's you love I only seek
It's the one that's meant for G'
Baby I'm sorry please stay don't you leave 
Stay don't u leave me

[Chorus 2x]

Cause i want u baby
Anything i've done i'm sorry
I'll climb a moutain,Swim a shore 
Anything you want from me
i'll give you that & much much more 
Yes i will baby
Come on 
If you want I'll kiss the ground that you walk on
Cause that's just how much I love you
All I ever wanted to do is make you happy baby
Tonight I want you by my side
