World Is So Cold 
Written by: E.Lumpkin, T.Mosley 

The world is so cold 
Why did you leave me standing there 
Alone in my shadow 
Looking for your prescence 
But it's not there 
Repeat 
One thing's on my mind 
The thought is having you 
To have you next to me 
Thats where you want to be, baby 
You're a diamond, you're my world 
Tell me where did you go, baby 
How could you leave that night 
And leave me all alone 
Already the world is so cold 

Chorus 
I'm lost and all alone 
No doubt I'm miserable 
Got much good love to give 
Alone's no way to live, baby 
You made me feel so whole 
And now I've broke apart 
I can't believe you're gone, baby 
It tore apart my heart 
The world is so cold, baby 

Chorus 

why did you leave me 
I've never done anything to you, why did you leave me baby 
ooh 
There's already pain in my life 
I didn't need no more from love 
Now you've given me ? 
Yes you did 

why did you leave me 
I've never did anything wrong to you 
why did you 

The world is so cold 
I miss you 
The world is so cold 
I love you 
I don't understand why 
What I've ever done to you
