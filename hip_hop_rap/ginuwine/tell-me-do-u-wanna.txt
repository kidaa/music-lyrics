Check me out Baby 

Chorus: 
Tell me do U wanna go home with me? 
Tell me do U wanna come creep with me? 
Tell me do U wanna get wild with me? 
Tell me do U wanna go home? 


Tell me do U wanna go home with me? 
Tell me do U wanna come creep with me? 
Tell me do U wanna get wild with me? 
Tell me do U wanna go home? 


1st Verse 
The dance floor is jumpin' 
The music is pumpin' 
I'm checkin out your grooves 
'Bout to make my moves 
Across this crowded room 
Cause I'm scoping you 


I'm feeling confident 
I just came from the bar 
Sick of wondering 
Who the hell you are 
Cause I want you 
What a Fella gotta do 
Tell me. 


*Chorus*
Tell me do U wanna go home with me? 
Tell me do U wanna come creep with me? 
Tell me do U wanna get wild with me? 
Tell me do U wanna go home? 
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me, Tell me 
Oooh Aaaah 


2nd Verse 
You wanna have some fun? 
Come ride with me, Let's chill 
I'll take you to a place 
And both of us get ill 
Cause I'm feeling you 
Just tell me what to do, Baby 


Take my hand lets go 
That's all I wanna do 
Fellas wondering 
How to step with you 
Cause my game was tight 
Everything turned out right 
That Night, Tell me 


*Chorus* 
Tell me do U wanna go home with me? 
Tell me do U wanna come creep with me? 
Tell me do U wanna get wild with me? 
Tell me do U wanna go home? 
Tell Me, Tell Me, Tell Me 
It ain't Nuthin but a Thang 
You ain't said nuthin but a word baby 


Bridge: 
I'll break you off 
till the sun comes up 
Baby, come and get this thang Gyrl 
Won't tell a soul 
It's Down Low 
Trust Me, I'll give you what you want Baby 
Let's go get freaky 
Cause I'm in the mood 
Get Nasty, get wild on my side Baby 
Wanna get in where I fit in Baby 
Baby, Tell me do you wanna go. 


*Chorus*
Tell me do U wanna go home with me? 
Tell me do U wanna come creep with me? 
Tell me do U wanna get wild with me? 
Tell me do U wanna go home? 
I gotta have you all to myself, Yes I do 
I've been peeping U 
I like your style 
I like the way you move 
Yes I do 


Tell me do ya, uh?echoes   fades 
Tell me do ya aaah? echoes, fades   ends
