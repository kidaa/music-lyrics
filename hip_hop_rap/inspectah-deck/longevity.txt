[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Uh, yea.
In my time, I've seen a lot of people come and go.
A lot of new faces, been to a lot of new places.
Wherever we went, we always held it down.
While we conquered new grounds. It's a universal sound.
The Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game.
Yo...
[Chorus x2: Inspectah Deck]
Not many last in the game
Wu-Tang come through, breakin out the same way we came
This is not an act, this is actual facts
Nothin but experience placed upon the tracks
[Inspectah Deck]
We stand perpendicular with no flaws
Breakin all laws, plus jaws, the writin's on the walls
Heartless, starvin artists, out to get our's
Regardless, marvelous doctrics, we shot this
Fist of the black lotus, bustin out the steel cage
Iron Mic Duel made the front page
Outlaws, out for your's, get down on all fours
Rebel with a cause, without a force to the score
Pillagin with 'donna Cap's, the personna raps
Hittin like a quarter back, blistered on the track
Fully-auto, cop the mic blow, strike low
High-caliber flow move the crowd, twist your torso
2009, block party, Bobby Digital, pop corks to us
and the God's we trust, it's adjust
To the highs that we bring with the lows
and the Mr. Hell speakin out in morse code
Runnin wild like dogs out the kennel through the venue
Simple chemistry, vitamins plus the minerals
Organic vowels, consonants, syllables
Condition critical, ill individual
Paint a picture too vivid for the visual
Material rips through to the gristle
[Chorus x2]
[U-God]
Yo, the measures in my music grab you, stuck in my sentence
Got to spit from the bottom less pit, speakin my vengeance
Masked avenger never surrender my heritage
Killah Hill resident, 5'10"; be my measurement
On land we stand under flags as confederates
You think you rule, pitty the fool when the shell drops
Hot bodies scream to the extreme, damn, I'm delicate
We livin irrevant, intelligent, dirty habit
Lake full of fragments, abandon all 10 commandments
Damage is done as the records spins, hatred in my features
Untamed, thus these cold blooded creatures bust
Architect gladiator radiates the power
Erupt with corrupt minds, locked in the tower
The crook's pressure cooked invasion be destroyed
Self-employed paranoid androids
[Inspectah Deck]
My rhyme cold winds clear streets and slams shutters
Basic Instinct to tear the roof off the mother
Drastic verbal gymnastics, far from the average
Hold the planet like Galactus
Lone Ranger ancester scroll with zone bangers
Never met a force deadly as my own anger
Clutched performer, raised on the blood soaked corners
A real life with real tight feds, they brain on ya
And not many last on
