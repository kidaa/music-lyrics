I'm drivin' 
Benz 190
2.5 and you know where to find me
Driving down the highway 
Girlies behind me
Jockin' blindly
No need to remind me
Who I am I know you know me
Stop screamin' and yellin' and pointin' I'm low key
No I ain't got no time for a picture
But slide your number 
And I'll get wit ya
You wanna ride 
Ya shouldn't of said that 
You played yourself
And I know where your head's at
Drive my car don't make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek maybe
But I ain't trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Here's the deal so spread the word
No, 
I ain't got no girlfriend
No,
I ain't buy no car
No,
I ain't got no babies
A lot of ladies
Naw, they want money
And I can see'em a mile away
And when they push up
I just smile and say
Back up off me
Smell the coffee
You're screamin' and plottin'
And I'm killing you softly
Watchin' you melt from the second I kiss ya
Hear dollar signs in your careless whispers
I know the game it's old and lame
You're holdin' a flame for my name and my fame
Livin' like Givens schemin' on Tyson
But she got lucky cause he was a nice one
But I ain't nice and I don't play that
If it ain't tax I don't pay that
You think you're in cause you turn me on
Here one minute and the next you're gone
I made rhymes
I made cash
Why get married and you take half
No, 
I ain't got no girlfriend
No,
I ain't buy no car
No,
I ain't got no babies
A lot of ladies
Naw, they want money
The police I'm givin' them fits
A young brother in a Benz legit
I don't sell no drugs and take no shh
Park my ride and the ladies hit
So many ladies the cops had a hint
They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all wanna get with
The man with the money
So they wanna get with
The microphone master
And ride shotgun
So people can see ya
And think I got one
No sorry nothin's happenin'
Moe Dee's single while he's rappin'
If girls keep lyin' and crashin' my party
Ya'll gonna make me hurt somebody
No, 
I ain't got no girlfriend
No,
I ain't buy no car
No,
I ain't got no babies
A lot of ladies
