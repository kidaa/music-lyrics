No place to hide, no placy to cry,
no place for future, no place for presence,
no place for war, no place for win,
no place for sun, no place for moon,
no place for love, no place for hate,
no place for flower, no place for tree,
no place for man, no place for woman,
no place for children, no place for human,
no place for animal...
no place for you, no place for me.
It is time for machines...
