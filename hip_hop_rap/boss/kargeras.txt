Once a long time ago they lived
somewhere...
I'm drawing back the dark
curtain of time,
over the land ancient and lost,
forgotten in immense depths of ages,
where nothing begins and nothing ends.
With mix of love and sorrow,
I'm watching beautiful land
thats already by its birth
was ordained to come to an end.
Why? It disappeared under the layers
of millenniums, not even a recollection
has remained.
Where went the living and dead
so beautiful and yet mortal?
It only lives in my mind,
the woesomely sad recollection
of the cruel fate and my beloved.
Proud nation - KARGERAS!
