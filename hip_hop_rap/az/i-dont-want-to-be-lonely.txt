My bags are packed and I'm about to go 
You said you need the time to be alone 
But just incase you have a change of mind 
Here's my number where I'll be tonight 

You know it's hard for me to understand 
But I'm gon' try to be an understanding man 
I'm hoping you will have a change of heart 
'Cause without you, I'm gon' fall apart 

1 -    I don't want to be lonely 
       I don't want to see a day without you 
       Don't want nobody else in your arms 
       Don't want nobody holding you 

       I don't want to be lonely 
       I don't want nobody laughing with you 
       Don't want nobody else in your heart 
       Don't want nobody loving you 

I left an address on the kitchen door 
With a set of keys, both mine and yours 
I'm hoping I won't need these keys for long 
'Cause I'm praying you'll ask me back home 

Repeat 1 

Oh baby baby baby baby 
Don't walk don't walk from me from me 
I know that you will need, some time to yourself 
I'll give you give you what you what you 
Hope you need from me
I will give you the space, girl, whatever it takes 
I don't wanna be here alone so alone 

My bags are packed and I'm about to go 
I'm giving you the time to be alone 
But just incase you have a change of mind 
Here's my number where I'll be 
Baby, baby, baby 

I don't want to be lonely I don't wanna be lonely baby
I don't want to see a day without you not a single day without you
Don't want nobody else in your arms I don't want no one in your arms
Just me... Don't want nobody holding you ...And you

I don't want to be lonely don't let me be lonely baby
I don't want nobody laughing with you my sweet, sweet baby
Don't want nobody else in your heart 
Don't want nobody loving you 

My bags are packed and I'm about to go 
My bags are packed and I'm...
