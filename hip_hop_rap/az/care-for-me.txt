[Babyface]

Looking in your eyes
It's written on your face
I can read your mind
You feel the same as me, baby, girl it's
Time you face the truth
You're in love with me
And I think it's time that you came around

Girl you care for me
Like I care for you
And you think of me all the time
Girl you want from me
What I want from you
And you dream of me every night

There's nowhere you can run
Nowhere you can hide
Can't you feel it girl
You're running outta time, baby, girl it's
Nothing but your fate
You're supposed to be with me
So start acting like you're my baby, girl

[CHORUS]

It's really not good for you to
Deny the feelings deep inside you
You're really overdue, you need to open up
Truly girl, it's time for you to
Come to terms with what's inside you
This ain't no time to run away from love

[CHORUS]
