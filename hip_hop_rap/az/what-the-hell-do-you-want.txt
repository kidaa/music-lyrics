I gave you the best year of my miserable life 
Every penny I made went to making your day 
and making you smile 
Now the well has run dry

'cause I'm losing my head

There's many other fish in the sea to be caught 
So let me tell this, baby 
I'll be catching when I set it off

Stop blowing up my beeper 
You made the choice to creep 
but I got to be strong
