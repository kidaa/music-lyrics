[Babyface & Keith Andes]

Take it from me
That you're gonna be in love
Just give yourself some time
You're just in a shaky frame of mind
Take it from me
That everyone's not that way
Just out to break your heart
So baby don't fall apart

I know that it hurts sometimes
But girl if you let me ride
I'll make you feel the way you want
I'll make you feel like you're in love
Don't want you to compromise
We can just take our time
Whatever makes you feel you're loved
That's all I want

Take it from me
You're gonna love someone
I can see it in your eyes
Somebody's gotta treat you right

Take it from me
Your life is bound to change
He'll never, ever break your heart
You'll never have to feel that pain

[CHORUS]

You have this tendency to blame things on yourself
Has it not occurred to you, that it may be someone else
There is an urgency to change the way you feel
Well I'm here to make the way for you
Girl you're not by yourself

[CHORUS]
