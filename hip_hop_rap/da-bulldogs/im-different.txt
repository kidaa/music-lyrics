It's starting to look like Junkion,
The garbage dump in space
We live like rat's on Junkion,
There's so much fucking waste
The poison, the poison
You're killing your own children
Wake up, wake up
You're burning down the forest
We're running out of oxygen,
We won't get out of here alive...
It's too late, the damage has been done
The toxins will get us all one by one
There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
It's like lookin' down the barrel of a loaded gun
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
No more poison, more poison corrosion
No more toxic, atomic explosions
No more jeaks of insane radiation
No more goddamn pollution cause I can't breathe
No, no way, ouinow...
We need a change, a change like skunk, skunk
It changed my life, could change the world, the world
Watusj, Watusj, the doobie was a doozy
I'm smoking, I'm toking, I'm really fucking hoping
If I get out of here, I'll be so very fucking high
