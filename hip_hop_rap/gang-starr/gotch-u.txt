[Guru]
Here's the jam I slam to make it known that
I diagram, write out my own rap
Cast the line, watch me shine, I'll assign
you to do this, you can review this
convention that comes from, combining sums from
equations or phrases, cause I begun some
exploratory digging, I'm thinking big and
I'm taking all your words, cause your site is blurred
and you're selfish, and rather immature
I've always felt this, that's why I'm giving more
I am sure, that you find that I'm the Guru
With this particular style I'm running to you
I gotch u

Keen is my site, and keen is my brain
I campaign to gain my domain
and vocalizing techniques, emcees are deadbeats
and drop to the ground then, I stomp em down with sound
I'm a pacifist, but they won't last with this
dope beat combined with lyrical energy
You can rewind this, play this again and see
just how I kick the, rhymes that hit ya
snug in your mug, while I depict a
scene that is hype and, I'm title swipin
If you're loungin, I'll take the mic and
show you how it goes in, I'll leave you frozen
I gotch u

I live my life with adventure, because I went for
the road seldom run, cause it was meant for
me to hold the spot here, your rhymes are not clear
Focus, on the way that I wrote this
I'm crafty, so how you gonna outlast me?
With your bogus crap, you're gonna have to note this
while I rap, and then I quiz you like a teacher
Give a speech to you while I impeach the
ones with the crowns and, my voice resounds and
take it from me, then you will see, I got the G
The Keith double-E, I got the know how
And I will show how the hip-hop will grow now
I gotch u

I got nothin to fear, nothin to hide
Bein conquered with the micraphone, I take you for a ride
and slide glide to the hoop and scoop you like
Clyde, Drexler, your girl I wanna get next to
Hold up I gotta flex to the stage, then engage
to do the knowledge, then backstage is where I'm headed
Don't sweat it, sit down clown and just let it be
Set it free, get it see
I got G, cetainly, and I gotch u
I gotch u

Once again, we got the GangStarr out in total effilzneck
I got my man DJ Premier... peace...
