[Verse 1:]
Get with this get with this 
get with this cuz you got no choice
Rappers sometimes you'll find make dough 
but yo you know they've got no voice
get him off the podium he ain't no speaker
yes he's just a phony and look at his sneakers
played out of style out of rhymes
he's out his mind
lost his way lost his pay
I'm takin' his props so call the cops
you can call 'em but I know 'em
Sweet MCs I think I'll ho 'em
cuz they front so very hard and big or small
I'll break 'em all
Ain't gotta say that I'm the best
my skills will show I passed the test
when it comes to beats and rhymes
we come correctly everytime
and stay tuned

[Chorus:]
stay tuned...

[Verse 2:]
with information like the CNN
I can take you there and then
the rest is up to you to choose
the bottom line is win or lose
suckers suckers suckers don't be listening
so I can't be waitin' on 'em
I ain't got no time to play, do you?
look at the state of things and tell me true
in the city any city life's a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
living by the gun or by the rifle
think they got a reason that ain't really sure
the death toll rises more
it's trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
but for a fool I have no pity
there'stoo much suffering too much struggle
too much injustice and don't it bug you
enough for you to press on harder
against the odds the wayn our forefathers
made away but foolishly we go astray
think about it and stay tuned

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
as my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
just for you to blast around the way
play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hitting '92 and on
showing how to make a dope rap song
doing this while some disperse
then dissolve like specs of dirt
our music pertains to those who remain
down with the real not wealth or the fame
peace out, we'll be back, stay tuned...

[Outro:]
Please stay tuned
