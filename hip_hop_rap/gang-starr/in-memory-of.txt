To my man G.O.V., I remember how you used to be
You were the illest man alive now I'm reading your eulogy
Eyes so serious, you told me hold my head
Pursue this rap shit and go forward never backwards
While you gripped Tec's tight, and ran niggaz out of town
I ripped up mics, showin wack niggaz how to sound
Still your essence, was callin
By two gunshots, at close range, your frame had fallen
Now like a angel you've risen
And you will stay in my heart, and yo I wish you were still livin
Word... this is in memory of

You were the flyest in the club with three bitches doin rub-a-dub
You was the pimp of all panderers
GQ, Johnny Presley, fuckin up the elegances
So many hookers on your schedule
Slammin Cadillac doors and mackin whores on the regular
You used to boost, the slickest of suits
Climbin through the back windows on the bus, you was ill Dukes
Until that chick you vicked, for the Cutlass
started snillz-niffin ki-daine, and went to cut cha
That freak shanked you six times in your sleep

To all my brothers doin time, whether or not you did the crime
You know the system is devised to keep you deaf dumb and blind
Like Scarface said, them cats are smart
In order for things to change we must all play a part
It's easy for us to blame society
But now it's way too late, and we must take responsibility
To all my brothers in the streets
I know you feel you gotta hustle cause your peeps gotta eat
Makin moves right and exact; don't wanna see you layin flat
Don't wanna see ya catch a bullet black
If we don't build we'll be destroyed
That's the challenge we face in this race of poor and unemployed
Freud, a philosopher, but I'm a realist
So philosophize this, without love we won't exist
To those who passed out there, in the deserts and the jungles
with pain on their shoulders, and heavy bundles
I pray each one will, ascend to new heights and new enlightenment
And this is why I'm writin it
Yeah... this is in memory of
