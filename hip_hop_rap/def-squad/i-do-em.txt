[Erick Onasis]
No game, for no-names
On the mic I spit flames, Rockwells to Janes
I'm the nicest without me in the game
it's a crisis - I control all mic devices
Scratch and E yo, we keep shit poppin
Control the mic, keep spittin and keep droppin
Lose 'em or bruise 'em, ruin 'em
Keep the madface screwin 'em
Keep pursuin 'em, keep doin 'em
all night til the crowd start booin
and when we get thumped by uh, Nuf and Clue and them
Yo, I keep shit comin from the bassment
Make hardcore cats take the route that Mase went
Not the God, but just plain quick
from fuckin with that D-E-F Squadron shit
This is my house, I told you before
Trespass on my shit, I catch you at the door
Jump off the rail, from the second floor
and kill you in here, without breakin the law
I do 'em, do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
DJ Scratch came with somethin mean
My jewels be gold, dough be Mitch Greene
[DJ Scratch] Awwwwwwww shit!  
I fucked up and did somethin STUPID right there
{*mumbling*}
[Erick Onasis]
Let's go!
Scratch came with somethin mean
My jewels be gold, dough be Mitch Greene
Rock Air Nike's with a ?? jean
Fresh black .45 tool by the spleen
Yeah, who wanna Abdul like Kareem?
I'm in the game of death, I'll cave your chest
Yo Scratch got the beat pumpin - iron
Reppin in sets of ten, I catch my wind
so I can, thicken for those who thinkin me hard-est
No forgivin, I'm leavin 'em scared
Pull you card, jump, go 'head catch a nitfit
You a bitch walkin around with smudged lipstick
I catch wreck cause I'm better than
anyone bring it South with the Mexican
Boy I bake like ovens, refresh like Tropical Plug-Ins
out the wall I'm ready to brawl
Siamese gat spittin, y'all hold y'all gats sittin
Take care witcha hardware
Are you a dope MC or relevant?
All y'all lightweight; me - I'm elephant
Top that!  Sy Scott, Khyree and me
Meet the new arsenal nigga, for 2G
I do 'em, do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
Yeah, yeah.. word up..
