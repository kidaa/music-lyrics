Daddy Daddy tell me a story of how you took out that wack MC
		No Daddy, tell them how you beat down that bootlegger
	Daddy Daddy tell us a story!

[Big Daddy Kane]
Heh heh, alright, alright, alright y'all OK
Come on y'all, crowd around Daddy now OK  C'mon
Y'all just sit there and listen
I'ma tell you about the MC
and I'ma tell you about the bootlegger, OK
Here we go children

It happened at a jam, some kid tried to sham on the program
So I had to silence the lamb and show him who I am
So I just set it off on my competitor
Freakin the funk as I hit em with crazy metaphors
Like back up off me Dukes, because you're trippin
You better dry your cranium off, cause your brain is slippin
You beatin me is somethin that I doubt
The only way you could bake Kane is workin in a crackhouse
No man alive can withstand the Kane flow
I kick so much flavor that my shoes look like a rainbow
You need a whole lot of practice, you thought that you was
on the money so I took you out like taxes!
Now you can Flea Off, releasin me G, easy be
to keep the great MC
Then I throw em I lean and mean record to spark
So I can school that ass just like Joe Clark
next I translated, my rap is more educated
and made it complicated for him to illustrate it
My dexterity, put him in fear of me
and had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin see
That was enough to slow his whole train of thought down
So I just speeded the pace up more than enough for him to come around
I triple the words, when makin the rhymes, whatever the rhythm
Puttin his mind in a prison
And oh yeah, that's how I did em

That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HEYYYYYYYY

I was out flex, lookin cold sex in a Lex'
Sippin on a Beck's, pumpin the remix of Das EFX
Drive down 125th with my man
And what did I see, bein sold at the stand
A bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it
So I snatched everything with my name on it
And give me that Kool G. Rap tape, and give me that Ice Cube
and all the Wu-Tang joints, cause they're my boys too
A man tryin to make a livin, I can't knock it
But now you tried to take money out of my pocket
Word to Miz, what the problem is, is that the kids
didn't buy it from The Wiz, they bought your shaky fibs so
now it's time to move him off the block
Pass me the glock cause I might make a body rock
And I'll break down sixteen shots
That's One + Eight + Seven on a undercover
bootlegger, you're worse than a beggar
Makin a fake profit, stop it
Cause I work hard for the money, to make cash flow
to have another come along and take my dough
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
So I just told my man, aiyyo
throw the tapes in the Lexus
Then we burned his whole stand down just like Waco, Texas
And then I jumped on the brother, with rage
Crushed his ribcage, damn did he get slayed
Cause I don't think he even know whatever hit him
Bootleggers beware, cause yeah I did em

That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HEYYYYYYYY

Give it your best shot, bring it with all you got
And watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot
Cause it ain't wise to address me
I wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me
Cause I don't just do em, I run through em
And I don't just hurt, uh uh, I body work em
Lyrical torture, never could support ya
For steppin to me, agony is what it brought ya
Cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
that could never be touched, and I mean this
So one love, I'ma leave you with the rhythm
Ain't no need to go off, cause yo hon know I did em

That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HUH that's how I did em HAH
That's how I did em HEYYYYYYYY
