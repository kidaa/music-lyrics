[Kane talking]
Here's a little food for thought,
as I tell it, cause if it happened to this cat,
then it can happen to you,
do the knowledge

[song starts]
I was sittin' outside double parked after dark,
I think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark,
That's when this stray cat walked up to me,
Now I was sure he would be,
but you woulda thought he'd know me,
tellin' his life story to me,
he said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life,
days of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype,
he rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot,
when I came out, he had a flat-top,
and when Naughty came out, a couple years ago,
he even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho,
vexed and down, you know next he found,
Heavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds,
no thanks to that, they ranked him wack,
only thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap,
so now he rhyme about the keys being sold,
the G's being fold, the trees being rolled,
now sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood,
talking thug game and had his record sales doing good,
and so now, you on the road to riches,
referring to the womankind as hoes and bitches,
yeah, you the man now because you rap is for ,
but you got your 7 year old daughter listenin',
the twist begin,
when that the image you projecting,
it starts to reflecting on your shorty cause she checking,

[Chorus X2]
Do you really know,
what's the path that you really need to go,
and what example you really need to show,
the good rep or the hood rep,
while she's walking in her father's footsteps

It be that excess drama, wonder rhymer,
that could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper,
that acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style,
plus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child,
you thinking that it couldn't happen,
but then it happen,
and now you're rappin, came back to haunt you,
because you want to,
be in her face puffin' li with your crew,
you even let her take a sip or two upon your brew,
instead of tryin to shed light, to keep her head right,
so that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might,
oh now you never did consider tho,
your kid could go,
trying to do the things she saw you do up in your video,
you went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able,
slipping, left your glock sittin' pon the coffee table,
so as you hang, with your gang, doin your thang,
BLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang,
came down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw,
right there, layin in blood across your livin room floor,
so now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief,
cause everything that ever mattered,
to you is all shattered,
instead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be,
you should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi,
cause if you would have stayed aware,
to whose in your care,
she wouldn't be no casualty to your career quot;

[Chorus X2]

Where did they find you,
you came into this game and let this new trend blind ya,
A amp;R's was wrong to sign ya,
you gotta be true to this game to stay in the art,
but guys like you get bent apart,
because you ain't got it in the heart,
representing who you better not be getting new,
how you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo,
your whole persona's theatrical,
ain't nothing bout you natural,
here, show me now, how many gats you pull,
cause when you talk that talk,
you gotta walk that walk,
or leave it up to the real OG's up North,
cause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised,
you couldn't handle 3 to 5,
cause many seeking fortune and fame,
got caught in the game,
thinking the thug status was supporting the claim,
all you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks,
but relax, cause this is just wax,
tell em again,
you gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks,
but relax, cause this is just wax,
one more time,
y'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks,
but relax, this just wax, nigga, damn

[Chorus X2]
