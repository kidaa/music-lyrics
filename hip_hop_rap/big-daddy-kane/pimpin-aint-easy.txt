Chorus:
	Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go:
	Pimpin' ain't easy Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zyyyyyy 6x

[Greg Nice]
One-two-three-four, to five-six-seven
eight, nine-ten, then ya got eleven
Twelve, thirteen, start your age;
fourteen-fifteen-sixteen, the pubic stage
Like an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum
better get off the virgin before I cuuuuum!
Pick up my pants and thump and thump
I think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some
Watch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum
I say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a
'Specially if the hoochie's on birht control-a
Lift her up just like a pick up truck
then I sat her down and we started to fuck
Made whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, YO-O-O-O-O!
I hope this time I don't make a cookie
Brothers everywhere be callin' me a rookie
Two from the Greg Nice from the o-o-old schoooooool
but bullshit, I ain't no fool, cuz
      Chorus
[Big Daddy Kane]
Well, I say...Extra! Extra!
Here is a bachelor comin' straight at ya
I see trim and bag it, take it home and rag it
the Big Daddy law is anti-faggot
That means no homosexuality;
what's in my pants'll make you see reality
And if you wanna see a smooth black Casanova -- BEND OVAH!
Cuz I don't half-step when it comes to broads
The K-A-N-E 'll go the whole nine yards
There's no time for coversation my dear
[MOAN!] is all I wanna hear
So let's make a move, as I get smooth
cuz the purpose I serve is to soothe
I'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk
Even white girls be sayin'  quot;Ooh, Kane's a hunk! quot;
Even Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi
Some try to copy, but they look sloppy
So imitators who wanna step to a
brother like me, lick my manure!
      Chorus
[Smooth B]
I'm just goin' and I'm flowin' like a gigolo
and when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Hoe
But now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-C-E
and if the girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee
I love bonin', and all my friends they will agree
that when it comes to pimpin' hoes...it ain't easy
First name: Smooth.  Last name: B
WHen I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly
I like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg
and when I take off my clothes, the I form a third leg
They rub it with oils and suck it with ice
Now I'm sweating....my mind is in paradise...
      Chorus
[Scoob Lover]
Tip-tip-toein', Scoob Lover's out hoein'
Braggin' to the fellas how my flattop was growin'
buyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin'
right in front of me...mmm...not even knowin'
A brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty
Nametag earrings readin' off  quot;Tootie quot;
Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams;
from my eyesight that was what it seemed
I said, uh,  quot;Come a little bit closer quot;
To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said  quot;Hi
Hi...hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak quot;
I said,  quot;Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate quot;
So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder
went for Tootie cuz the girl was much older
East to the Benz, I slowly walked;
clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
Sex in my mind, I was sure of it...
I wanted to tax that ass like the government!
      Chorus
[Ant Live]
Well, it's Friday night, ain't a damn thing funny --
Bitch better have my money
