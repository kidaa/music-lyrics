Whoa...whoa...whoa...oh...ho...ho...
Ooh...ooh...yeah...
Ah, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

Girl, I love you so
I promise you I'll never let you go
Till the end of time
You will always be forever mine, baby

We will share our joy
We'll care and understand each other, boy
A love that's built on trust
I'll never love again, you're the only one

You give me all that I need
And I can't get you out of my mind
We have the love everyone wants
And we know it's real 'cause the way we feel
It was so hard to find

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Our love is strong and stronger we'll get
Like a hand in glove, nothing's closer than this
That's what love is {Oh...oh...baby...oh...}

Your touch, your tender kiss
Your smile I can't resist
No one can love me better
Until the end of time we'll be together

You're a special part of me
A tender far beyond what one could see
Keep on lovin' me this way
Forever in my heart you'll always stay, baby

Oh, you give me all that I need
And I can't get off of my mind
We have the love everyone wants, see and-and
And we know it's real 'cause the way we feel
It was so hard to find

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Our love is strong and stronger we'll get
Like a hand in glove, nothing's closer than this
That's what love is Oh...
Honey, honey, honey, baby, baby

Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

I love you forever, together for better
Caring and sharing, please don't leave me never
{No way}

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Our love is strong and stronger we'll get
