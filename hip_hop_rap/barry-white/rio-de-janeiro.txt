Have you been there?
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
What're you talking about, man?
I'm talking about Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio

I've been to Rio de Janeiro
I love the fun in the sun and the people
In Rio de Janeiro, it's so exciting to see
No matter where you go

Any time, day or night, everything is so alive
Music there is really hot
You should see them do the Rio rock
Nothing like it nowhere else
It's a feeling that I've never felt
Never stops, never ends
It blows your mind just being there

In Rio de Janeiro
I love the fun in the sun with the people
In Rio de Janeiro, it's so exciting to see
No matter where you go

I went to Sugar Hill the other night
From the top you see the city lights
Took the cable car to the other side
The moon above was big and bright
Then I saw this huge crowd
People dancing and singing loud
People smiled as I walked around
I felt so good, so I got down
In Rio, Rio de Janeiro

I've been to Rio de Janeiro
I love the fun in the sun and the people
In Rio de Janeiro, it's so exciting to see
No matter where you go

I've been to Rio de Janeiro
I love the fun in the sun and the people
In Rio de Janeiro, it's so exciting to see
No matter where you go
