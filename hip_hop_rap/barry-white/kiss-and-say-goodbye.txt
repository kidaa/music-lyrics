This is got to be the saddest day of my life
I call you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you anymore
Because of my obligations and the ties that you have.

We've being meeting here everyday
And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you, just one more time.

When you turn and walk away
Don't look back
I wanna remember you, just like this
Let's just kiss and say goodbye.

I have to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'til I'm through
This is something I hate to do.

We've being meeting here so long
I guess what we've done, all was wrong
Please darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye.

Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
I'm gonna miss you I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do.

It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye.

I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
I'm gonna miss you Understand me, won't you try
I'm gonna miss you It's gonna hurt me I can't lie.
