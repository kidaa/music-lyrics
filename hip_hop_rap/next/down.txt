K. Green
Breath down my neck but don't take a bite
My blood's not sweet enough for you
Reel me in hook line and sinker
Throw me back I'm not big enough for you
You should know by now
Giving up is the easy way
Giving up is the easy way out
You should know by now
Giving up is the easy way
Giving up is the easy way out
Where's the challenge in running
Where's the strength in blowing it all to the wind
For all that we've been through
For all the sweat and tears
Just try and send me packing, Dear
Nothing's gonna take us down
Nothing's gonna break us down
Like a bullet in your barrel
Like an angry superhero
Nothing's gonna take us down
You should know by now
Giving up is the easy way
Giving up is the easy way out
You should know by now
Giving up is the easy way
Giving up is the easy way out
Nothing's gonna take us down
Nothing's gonna break us down
Like a bullet in your barrel
Like an angry superhero
Nothing's gonna take us down
