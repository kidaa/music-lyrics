You couldn't even bring yourselves to stay around 
You had to go spoil it all 
And now you had to go 

Now I find these endless nights 
And all the blightful days to think 
You never will 

*Take this life, take it all 
In your hands 
If you were mine I could smile* 
Again, stay, fine 

Again I dream you come to me and comfort me 
And now I dream 
Where did the smile go 
Where did the smile go 
Didn't bother go oh 

And then 
You had to go and spoil it all 
And now I've learned 
You never will 
Repeat* 
Here, come, stay, fine 
Repeat* 
Again 

Just what you said was cool advice 
I discovered sticks could be knives 
I discovered I could die in your chains 
Still I feel so won't you stay 

Repeat* 
Here, come, stay, fine 
Repeat* 
Again
