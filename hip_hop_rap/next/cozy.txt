Yo, whassup baby
It's me, R.L. the real
Yeah, I know you all heard about me
It ain't even like that, boo
I ain't livin' like that
And I know you think I just want you to come over
So I can hit the skins

Nah, I just want you to lay back with me
Get real comfortable
Get real cozy
And just chill, till you're ready

[1] - Ready, set for the Moet
Put on some Next
Cuz we're about to get real comfy
And cozy

Yo, T-Low, tell 'em what I'm trying to say

So what's on your mind
Girl, I can see it in your eyes
You're thinking I wanna come inside
But that's not why you're here tonight
Girl, we can get it on
But we don't have to take our clothes off
I'm not all about that boom-boom that zoom-zoom
I just wanna chill and maybe settle down

[Repeat 1]

Don't cha know it's on tonight

[2] - Lord have mercy
Pour the Hennessey
Come chill with me
And we can both be 
Real comfy and cozy

Girl, lets get a little closer
Some dull conversation helps to
Resist the temptation
We can break out the lubrication
I'm gonna rub your back where it's safe, yeah yeah
Girl, you know that I respect you, yeah
And I can wait for the skins, it's cool
I'm just gee
To finally be here alone with you, oh

[Repeat 1]

You can feel right at home with me

[Repeat 2]

On the next album, watch me now
Making much smooth sailin' tonight
Oh, we can just chill tonight, yeah
Do the thing that I wanna do
Is puff a little light
And being real high, baby
Nothing but smooth sailin' tonight
Only thing that I wanna do is sip a little wine

[Repeat 1]

Can ya sway with some Alehze` baby

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]

[Repeat 1]

Ready, set
