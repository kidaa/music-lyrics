K. Green, B. Lincoln
There's more than one girl in here
To deal with all the pleasures
and all the pain and all the guilt 
they bring
There's a knot in the string
that links my childhood 
with my present
It blocks me
Yet, the passion remains the same
They just keep changing names on me
There are things I refuse to deal with
Scary things that come out in awkward ways
Fake it, do I fake it?
The Dreamer Girl fakes it better than I do it for real
Yet, the passion remains the same
They just keep changing names on me 
On me
There must be something on me!
Little did I know I was 
Standing on a rock that has now turned to sand
Turned to sand
And it's about rejection and it's about shame and
It's about walking away with what little dignity you can save
And it's about approval and it's about making it
To fill this jealous empty hole inside
Yet, the passion remains the same
They just keep changing names on me
On me
There must be something on me!
Little did I know I was 
Standing on a rock that has now turned to sand
Turned to sand
