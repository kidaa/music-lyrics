Can you hear my heart beat in this bond 
Do you know that behind of this bond 
Lies the deep desire I'm in love hey 
Make a wonderful love if I may 
All my dreams to be all I can do 
Only I love, only love 
And you say I knew we should find a new way 
Make a wonderful love if I may

Do you know that behind of this hurt

And you say I knew we should find a new way 
Make a wonderful love if I may 

Can you hear my heart beat in this hurt
