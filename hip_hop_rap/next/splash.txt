Welcome to nextasy baby
ohh yes
I've gotta know can I 
splash-splash-splash
baby I wanna jump and dive and splash
in your love yes
Can I splash in your love baby

I used to be afraid of water
til I got a life jacket
now I always seem to find myself 
laughin and splashin oh yeah
theres no waters that fall quite like yours
how I love to swim your sticky shores

[Chorus:]
Can I.....
Splash
can I take a dip, can I take a dip
inside your love
I just wanna swim, baby let me swim
let me come
I just wanna splash in your lake of love
[repeat chorus]

Can I splash
As I used to play across your choclate beaches
I would always vision your love canal
dreamin I could reach it
oh yeah
and as I wait in your waters of passionate cream
I realize its not a dream
I can finally splash I dont have to ask
nooooo

[Chorus:]
Can I.....
Splash
can I take a dip, can I take a dip
inside your love
I just wanna swim, baby let me swim
let me come
I just wanna splash in your lake of love
[repeat chorus]

Let me die inside your love
can I splash inside just once
let me go
I'll make you come
oh let me come

S is for sexual
P is for pleaseure
L is for love me-cuz baby you bettah
A is for anytime
S is for special
H is for happiness whenever were together

I could splash
just to get the chance
to get in your pants
to make sure that you feel good
I wanna know I'm out for your love
and you know when I'm asleep
I'm a sexual freak
gotta meet
come and see me baby
when it come to sex

so incredible which me tweet and tlow
wannna know can we splash

Can I take a dip inside your love
you gotta let me

[Chorus]
[repeat 3 times]
