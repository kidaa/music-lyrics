alright homies legalize reefer leaves and nines
some of them say we evil a little sumthin sumthin for my people
and though I know that weed will even out your debt

ohh yeah time to smoke said so I know high day come around on friday
toke the bowl breath deep boy yes then we pray
as the reefer help me see more everyday

verse three
thug that talkin till we love that love that that
dont legalize cuz they know we can
gettin high just to get by 
through all the suicides and homicides 
and genocides drivebys walkbys gonna multiply
and chalk lines in the towns in the h-double-o-d hood and it would rain
and it aint all were it aint all and it aint all and it aint all good
I started at eleven stealin weed from coppers 
and even though you beat us I gotta thank you for the reefer
neva mess with white girls but I roll those white boys 
niggas come out the pen and they roll some tight joints tight joints
my shit is swollen you shouldnt be rollin
livin on green leaves that will make your heart bleed
just go and let me split up the weed and be silent and sober
no jokin when the nieghbers door is open you want to come over
we smokin tokin and now we chokin tokin and then we chokin chokin chokin 
chokin chokin chokin chokin chokin
I'm so high
