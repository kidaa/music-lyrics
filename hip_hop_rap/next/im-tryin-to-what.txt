[chorus]
Your body is killin
Im saying whats up what's up
We chillin, some drinkin
Come grab you a cup grab you a cup
Can you quit trippin
Come show me some love
We're leavin, just listen
Go hop in the truck
Your body is killin
Im saying whats up
We chillin, some drinkin
Come grab you a cup
Can you quit trippin
Come show me some love
We're leavin, just listen
Not trying ta what...

How could you
Walk in here
Knowing everyone would
Look at you...
Tightest fit I've ever saw on
Had no bra on
I want you...
To come pop a squat
Have a couple shots
Let me talk to you.
Get a little buzz on
Then we can do what grown ups do.

Stop the actin
Feel the attraction.
What's happnin
Let's get this crackin.
I'm nasty
What's up Miss Jackson.
Got some hot candles
and a real cold mattress.

[chorus]

And it's so loud I can hardly hear
But shorty best believe I see your body clear.
No bra, my high, no underwear
Got me thinkin bout
what's under there.
Ma, I can't lie when I peep the rear
And I tie just cause mommy u aint represent
I die my cranberry and Belvedere
And I pulled you near

[female]
And said
Let's get out of hear...

Stop the actin
Feel the attraction.
What's happnin
Let's get this crackin.
I'm nasty
What's up Miss Jackson.
Got some hot candles
and a real cold mattress.

[chorus]

Me and my guys 
are parked outside.
And we
Tryin ta get into something tonight
Like outta these clothes
If it's alright.
Like at the Mo
Hugged up real tight, right...

[female]
Me and my girls
Just gettin our dance on
Makin you
wanna take dance on
Boy stop
I think you bettah take your hands off
Maybe Not...

Let's go...

[chorus]

[female]
Boy I been checkin you
Checkin me out
Know you want me at your house
Kissin me all in my mouth
Yah...

Baby I can't lie,
I,I've been checkin you out
Thinkin bout
What I'd do to you
Cause your bodies killin me

[chorus Repeat 3x]
