K. Green
When I died you came to me
Leather straps bound my arms
I couldn't reach you
When I died all was wild
Poppies grew in my head
Everyone was red like the dead
Stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened like this
Stranger things have happened...like this
When I died something pried my eyes wide open
I saw stars all around whispering my name
When I died my past flashed before me
My future was a stage I couldn't leave yet
Stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened like this
What am I doing here?
You adore me
Stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened like this
What am I doing here?
You restore me
If not for you, I wouldn't be here
If not for you, I would leave here
If not for you, the circus would have skipped this town
If not for you, I would have drowned
If not for you, If not for you
If not for you, I would have died...near here
Stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened like this
Stranger things have happened...like this
Stranger things have happened
Stranger things are happened now
What am I doing here?
Thank you for the strange things
