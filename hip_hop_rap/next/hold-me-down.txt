Ghetto...
Yo...
Hold me down...

[Chorus]
All I ever need is my wifey
And some real niggas behind me
A lady to hold me down
My niggas will hold me down
Someone that can ride in the passenger side
Ride or die
Cop the cake
Then we define
Cant nothin hold me down...
yo...
Cant nothin hold me down...

The sun dont shine, sun dont shine
If I, can't wake up next to mine
Wake her ass up, tap her one more time
No more baby sleepin, but she don't mind
She's ghetto
But she keeps a nigga level
Even when I'm short on change
She won't complain
Even got an extra job to maintain

[chorus]

I use to be real friendly with everybody
Til somebody tried to take my baby
Now the only niggas that hang with me
AreA chosen few My chosen crew Cause
Some niggas are slimy dude But
You know who, I'm talkin to you Trust
Real recognize, real for real, this is Robert, we fell, way before the deal

[chorus Repeat 2x]

No matter how hard it is
Or how bad the storm gets
I promise this...
That I will always be right here...
If it's a dollar it's fifty cent apiece
If it's a million you get five hundred g's
Cause we are family...
I'll ride for you, if you'll ride for me...

[chorus Repeat 2x]
