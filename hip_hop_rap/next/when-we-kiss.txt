Remember when the first day when I met you
I looked in your eyes
That's when I truley knew
Could not say a thing cuz I felt the same
I didn't even know your name
But I already claimed ya
You were so nexcellent So nexcellent
Magnificent Magnificent
So eloquent So eloquent
You must have been heaven sent

You were so marvelous Marvelous
So damn mysterious Mysterious
Got me delirious Delirious
Make me wanna get serious, oh
So turn off the lights, oh

[1] - Cuz right then I knew it was on, knew it was on
Cuz when we kiss
It was on, it was on, it was on
We fell so deep in love
We fell in love with one kiss
And when we touched
We were makin' love, makin' love, makin' love
Until the break of dawn
We fell in love with one kiss
We fell in love with one kiss
We fell in love with just one kiss

So meaningful, so sexual
My heart and soul, the love is fire
Can't wait to get you home
Yeah, you know it's on, the love is strong
And when we kiss I gotta say I'm lovin' it

Girl, you're beautiful
And you remind me of a diamond the way you shine
You know that I wanna make you mine
So come home with me for eternity
Forever be in L-O-V-E
So turn off the lights

Let's set the mood for kissing all night
Oh, I love to kiss you
