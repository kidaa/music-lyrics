[1] - Do you think about me
When you're laying next to him
How I used to flex you right
How I used to hold you tight
How you get all stickey with me
And making love all night

Do you think about me
When you're laying next to him
How I used to flex you right
How I used to hold you tight
How you get all stickey with me
And making love all night

You there with him
Said I live for less
Knowing your second best
I toss and turn, can't rest
I know you think of the night
You slept with your head on my chest
I can't imagine you're happy with him
I confess, to have had a chance to love you 
I feel blessed
But I see my princess
And my heart pounds in my chest
I just can't let you go
And I gotta know
Do you think about me, yeah

[Repeat 1]

As I reminisce of the love we shared
Baby, you know I care
Anything you want, anything you need
Baby, I'll be there
Guess he dirty macked
You left but I'll take you back
Don't know what it is
I guess ya just gotta like that
Ya got me open baby
Ya got me going crazy
Just wanna hold on
This love I got is so strong
I just can't let you go
And I gotta, I gotta, I gotta know
Do you think about me

[Repeat 1]

Girl I know he can't love you like me
I wanna love you
Completely, sweetly, baby
I got more love than you'll ever need
So girl now let me show you, yeah yeah
Oh girl, listen to me, yeah
