feat. Adina Howard

Rockabye baby and it don't stop
When the shirts fall, the pants will drop
Down will come bouncers, panties and all
It's on, it's on, its on

Yo, huh, this is R.L.
What we tryin' to do right now
Is figure out
Who the freak of the industry is
And we feel like next got the flex
But Adina, we gotta take the reins
You know what I'm saying
So what we about to do is put it all on the line
You get yours and I'mma get mine
Yo Next, Adina, sup

[1] - You can't handle
What I'm 'bout to give you
A Next experience
ah, go 'head daddy
I'm all about it but Adina Howard can sleep
I just wanna touch and clutch and feel you
Put some whip appeal in it
go 'head daddy
go 'head mommy

Boy peep this freak in me
Testing out this feather weight
Who can't handle this heavy weight
Some talking I'll just perpetrate
I got what you need
Come and get a load of me
I'll make it hurt like baby birth
When it's on girl, I put it work
Even when I'm gone we can flex
You call me collect
We can have phone sex cuz
cuz what
You can't handle it, no, no, no

[Repeat 1]

Between my thuggin' I'm butta lovin'
Hips bumpin', lips like she just finished licking something
She say ya take beat
Just to peep a freak stunting
Bowl mamma's doing tricks
Like the Globetrotters 
Politicking while I blow scama's
Uh huh, I'm rippin' rappin' dough dotters
Giving strow rhythm cuz his flow proper
And like it rough like some more vodka
Know she freaked out
but can't knock her 
And I can be a freak until the day
Until the dawn
Baby, don't front when it's time to bring the bomb
I'll make ya feel it in your tummy
Word is bond, I'll have ya walkin funny
Talk is cheap just give me a beep
We can peep boy you'll get freak
Tell ya what baby, beep
Let's come next week
I'll make ya reach your peak, yeah

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Nasty, my type like it
Since it's Adina, yo I might bite it
Mad excited, pop the G to peep inside it
Let and divide it
Don't play the road way
So watch Rat while we four play
and pour more Alezay
Now your neck make ya crack let
Could sweat all day
Stuff the garcia
With dar tree
The guard see
While our positions harshly
I throw it in you to the end boo
Knees to chest, and next is next to flex

[Repeat 1 until fade]
