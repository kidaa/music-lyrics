[1] - I still love you babe
I'm still for you girl
I'll never leave you baby
Cuz I realize I need you in my life

Girl it just ain't right
What we said last night
Cuz I know we didn't mean it
You feel the love is gone
Cuz we don't get along
But I can prove you wrong
Girl I swear 

Cuz everytime I close my eyes I see you
And how I wanna live my life with you
There is no one 
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love

[Repeat 1]

In this relationship we spend alot of time
Now it would be wrong if everything was always fine
Girl, I know we've had our share of ups and downs
But it doesn't mean that we can't work this out
Oh baby girl, I care, yeah
You know I do

Cuz everytime I close my eyes I see you
And how I wanna live my life with you
There is no one else
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love

[Repeat 1]

No, oh girl, I know I need ya baby

Cuz everytime I close my eyes I see you
And how I wanna live my life with you
There is no one else
You're all I want and all I need
The only one I'll ever love

[Repeat 1]
