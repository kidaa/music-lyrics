Baby...
I can't sleep...
Can you tell me a lullaby...

Uh...
Heh...
A Lullaby...

Excuse me sista
Plus im wit ya
Let me holler at ya
Try to paint a picture
Of you and I
Champagne in ice
Little candle light
To set the mood right
Can you picture that
Wit ya hat
And wit ya coat
Cause we can roll
Back to my spot
I'm in the parking lot
Come on let's drop the top
Cool you off...
Cause girl your so fine...

[Chorus]
Your body is so
I gotta get you
I want you so bad right now
Cant wait to be alone cant wait to be alone
And have you in my room
So I can turn the lights out on you
Your body is so
I gotta get you
I want you so bad right now right now
Cant wait to be alone No
And have you in my room
So I can turn the lights out on you

Excuse me Mami
You here with somebody
I know you are probly
Cause your such a hottie
There's a private party
Back at my place
No ones there
Let's get outta here
I got the G-5 outside
valeted, ready to drive
Just say the words and we can ride
We can take 35, W, 494
Turn right on Candlewood and we're right in the door
cause....

[chorus]

I can't describe in words 
how much I love your curves
This is it
Come out of this
Come here lets kiss
And hit the switch

[chorus Repeat 3x]
