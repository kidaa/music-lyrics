Maintenance of these wheels on the rotation 
Carry me for house, in order to see my trunks 
Sing Songs over the south 
I miss Alabamy again 
And I think its a Sin, 

Well I heard Mr. Junge to sing over it 
Well I heard ole Neil to set it down 
Well I hope Neil boy me remind 
A southern man does not need it somehow around 

Sweet Home Alabama 
Where the skies are so blue 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lord, I come home to you 

In Birmingham they love the automatic controller 
Now we did all, what we could do 
Now Watergate does not disturb me 
Does your conscientiousness disturb it? 
Say the truth 

Sweet Home Alabama 
Where the skies are so blue 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lord, I come home to you 
Here I come Alabama 

Now the Swampers has muscle masses 
And it admits, in order to select a Song or two 
They receive lord me away as much 
They fetch me, if I feel blue 
Now as over it? 

Sweet Home Alabama 
Where the skies are so blue 
Sweet Hauptalabama 
Lord, I come home to you 

Sweet Home Alabama 
Oh sweet main baby 
Where the skies are so blue 
And the automatic controller applicable 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lordy 
Lord, I come home to you 
Yea, yea Montgomerys the answer receive
