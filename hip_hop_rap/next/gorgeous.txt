I hate to break it to you, we had nothing in common
We were so far apart
You liked Top 40 radio and I had my Joni Mitchell
We were helpless from the start
You wanted something more than I could ever give
You wanted to feel my kiss from the heart
But I only loved you because you're gorgeous
Long, long sleepless nights so unsatisfied
Never wanted a car or your money or a diamond ring
I never asked for anything from you
But I'd take honesty over jealousy any day
Something that you could never give to me
Anyway, I only loved you because you're gorgeous
I only cared because you're gorgeous
Last night you came to me in a dream
I thought my therapy had rid you from my memory
I was wrong
Everyone says, ";I love you";
Everyone says, ";I need you";
Everyone says, ";oh, darling marry me"; so casually it seems
But I only loved you because you're gorgeous
Said, I only stayed because you're gorgeous
Everyone says, ";I love you";
Everyone says, ";I love you";
Everyone says, ";I love you"; so casually it seems
But I only loved you because you're gorgeous
Said, I only smiled because you're gorgeous
Mmm...you're gorgeous
