Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 

I saw you move 
Moving on the dance-floor 
I really like 
I like what I saw 
In time I'm yours 
Anyway you want me 
Isn't it time you're the one 
I've been looking for 

You cast your spell 
Magic running through me 
The music plays 
I'm in heaven boy 
I've got what you want 
I am the girl for you 
No time to lose 

* Do it, do it, do it to me baby 
Do it, do it, do it to me baby 

** If you wanna 
Right the rumble with me babe 
All through the night 

[Repeat **] 

If you wanna 
Keep it comin' 
If you wanna 
Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 

Come on to me 
Take me home tonight 
Ain't nothing wrong 
It could feel alright 
Let smooth control 
Turn it inside out 
We could be getting it on 
'Til the morning light 

Don't have no doubts 
Take a chance on me 
I'm ready boy 
I may make you scream 
I've got what you want 
I am the girl for you 
No time to lose 

[Repeat * , **] 

Do it, do it, do it to me baby 

[Repeat ** , ** , ** , **] 

If you wanna 
Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 
Keep it comin' 

[Repeat ** , ** , **] 

*** If you wanna 
If you wanna 
If you wanna 

[Repeat ***]
