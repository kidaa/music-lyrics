Counting ships crossing Lake Blue
You don't seem to notice the light house has blown out
In my need, I'm crying for you
In my bleed, I'm dying for you to sail on
Crossing bridges but I just keep crossing over you
In a limousine in my mind
All that I am is everything you are
I'm your mirror, you're my scar
And I was innocent in your eyes 'til you went blind
I was a real saint
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain?
Putting the pieces together contradicting every word
Believing everyone is against you
";We'll all get you!";
What's that I see crossing Lake Blue
A battleship surrendering to the darkness inside of you
I was innocent in your eyes 'til you went blind
I was a real saint
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain, Boy?
I already said that I was wrong
In exile I'm already gone - if that's what you want
If that's what you want then I'll give it to you
I was innocent in your eyes 'til you went blind
I was a real saint
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain?
I was...counting ships crossing Lake Blue
