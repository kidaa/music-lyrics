Now I might not have
5 or 6 cars in my garage
But would you settle for a nice massage
And the love of a lifetime
Girl...
I swear to God that
With a whole lot of love
And little bit of faith
That we can make it
You just gotta believe that...

We could roll till the wheels fall off And
I'mma love you till my soul's gone on 'Cause
It can happen, baby, just hold on
Close your eyes and dream And imagine that

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolates and champagne just for you to taste
Close your eyes
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

Imagine Benzes in the parkin' lot
A different chauffeur for every car you got
Islands to settle on a private yacht Just close your eyes
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

I know you deserve
More than I got right now
But baby, there's no doubt
'Cause you've always stayed down

I swear to God that
With a whole lot of love
And a little bit of faith
That we can make it
You just gotta believe that

We could roll till the wheels fall off And
I'mma love you till my soul's gone on Hey
It can happen, baby, just hold on
Close your eyes and dream And imagine that

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolate and champagne just for you to taste
Close your eyes
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that And imagine that

Imagine Benzes in the parkin' lot
A different chauffeur for every car you got
Islands to settle on a private yacht
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that Close your eyes and imagine that, girl

{Some day} Just have my back and I promise that
{Some way} I'll work to try to cop you that
{If we pray} And believe, you will see that
{It'll be okay} You just gotta dream and believe

Imagine that
I can, can you, can we
We dream, ooh
You can have anything you need
A dream
But you've got to imagine that

Imagine that
I can, can you, can we
We dream, ooh
You can
If you close your eyes and imagine that

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolate and champagne just for you to taste
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that

A different chauffeur for every car you got Oh, oh
