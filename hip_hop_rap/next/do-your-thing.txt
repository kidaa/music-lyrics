Yah...
Don't stop now...
We done did it again...
I see you there from time to time...
I know whatchu lookin for...
I can give it to you...
Go on do your thing...

[chorus]
Go on do your thing mama
Just enjoy yourself
You aint gotta be all by yourself
Your not lookin for a man
You want a special friend
To lend a helpin hand tonight
Go on do your thing...

Baby your sure comin on strong
But aint nothin wrong
With going after whatchu want
How that you've been workin all week
Now your workin on me, feelin on me, buying me drinks
And your tellin me...

[female chorus]
I'm not a ho
Cause I slept with someone
So I'm not a trick
If I want a lil dick

I'm not tryin ta judge ya
I just wanna love ya

[chorus]

Girl the way your lookin at me
I can tell your a freak
And baby, I like what I see
You say it's been too long
You don't mean to come on strong
But you really need a tune up from someone...
Oh Girl...

[female chorus]

I'm not tryin ta judge ya
I just wanna love ya

[chorus]

We do it like this, like this...

Where all the ladies all alone in here
That wanna have fun tonight

Where all the fellas all alone in here
That can make my body feel right

Well Ma, I'm right here

Sometime I need somebody

Come and touch my body, sexy oooh

Sometimes ya need somebody
That'll touch your body
And that somebody should be me...

[chorus]
