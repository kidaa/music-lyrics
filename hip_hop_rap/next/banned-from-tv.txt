[Intro]
Man, I could kill this bitch
And this bitch nigga too
And what I can do
Yo, yo

Stressed out, went to smoke both
Pull the shit from my coat, let my gat blow
Nigga just came home
Smell smoke smoke, heard Barry on the stereo
Then I heard you moan, hoe
Opened up my bedroom do', oh no
Saw clothes on the floor
Looked on the bed and saw you

Riding him and he was callin' you boo
He was putting it all in you
I was blind and never woulda knew
Can't believe the both of you
He was 'spose to be my crew 
Watching y'all with a real good view
Tell me, tell me, what would you do

[1] - Should I do A, go about my way
Or B, find something to say
Or C, go straight up crazy
And do some banned from TV

Should I A, go about my way
Or B, find something to say
Or C, go straight up crazy
And do some banned from TV

Rolling up in my black Benz
Unlock the door to the crib and I walked in
That's when I smelled incense
On the stereo, Pac's rappin'
Suddenly I heard laughing 
And I heard somebody say "Action"
That's when I walked in
And saw it, you're kissin'

You with two other bitches
Handling the business with the quickness
Should I dismiss it, say we're finished
Or jump in it
I couldn't believe it, your face was in her cat
Should I come and bust that ass or pull out my gatt
What would you do

[Repeat 1]

Maybe I should join in
Crazy things happen to all of us
The ones we love get caught up in some crazy stuff
The one you trust could be somewhere, twisted love
What would you do

Nowadays, everybody seems to be on the hush
Your best friend could be somewhere up in her
If you busted him or if you busted her
What would you do

[Repeat 1]

I don't see what I see
And maybe have to pull out that thing thing
And go bang bang
In fact take off my damn ring
