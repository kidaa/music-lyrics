Problems
Problems with your girl today
Problems 
Problems with your man today

Situations
Hard to handle
Got me going out of my head
There's so much pressure
I just can't deal
You think it's all about
You and that sex appeal

But I got problems
Slickin' around on the "L" to the hotel, all around town
Let me know
Who's it gonna be, him or me
It can't be three

[Coffee Brown]
Here we are
The two of us together
Taking this crazy chance
To be all alone
My man don't know
That we been loving each other
Cuz if he found out
We'll have nothing 
Nothing but
