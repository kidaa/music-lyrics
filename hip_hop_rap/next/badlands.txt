K. Green
Tears ripping through the badlands
Tearing a hole in my heart
I want to wrap myself in your shadow
But I trip and fall on my head
Now I'm standing upside down
Now I'm staring at the sky
Safe and sound in your embrace
Your day old shoulder suffocates me
With that familiar sweet smell of your body
Possesses me like a ghost
Now I'm standing upside down
Now I'm staring at the sky
Life makes you tumble and frown
God made the feeling; so down
Life makes you tumble and cry wondering why
Now I'm standing on my head
Now I wish I could forget you
Life makes you tumble and frown
God made the feeling; so down
Life makes you tumble and cry wondering why
Tumble and frown
Tumble and frown
Tumble and...
Like a ghost with tears ripping through the badlands
