Oh, it's raining, it's pouring the old man is snoring
I'm inspired by the rain
It's raining, it's pouring the mirror man is snoring
I'm inspired by the rain again and again
I'm funny
Can't you see my knees are all diseased
So, I cover them
How I wish that I could look a lot like her
Can't you see that I can barely breath in this bubble of
dreams that I could look a lot like her
Oh, it's raining its pouring the lucky grave is snoring
I'm inspired by the rain
It's raining, its pouring the millionaire is snoring
I'm inspired by the rain again and again
I'm ugly
Can't you see my hands are all diseased
So, I cover them
How I wish that I could be as rich as her
Can't you see I'm losing sleep over sobriety
Oh, how I wish that I could throw up my vanity
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me, is this fair at all?!
Can't you see, I'm ugly
My knees are all diseased so, I cover them
How I wish that I could look a lot like you
Can't you see I'm losing sleep over sobriety
How I wish I could throw up my vanity
How I wish I could throw up my vanity
How I wish I could throw up my vanity
