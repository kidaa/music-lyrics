Feels Good...Oooh
Oh So Good...Oooh

Im in the E five-O-O
Goin out
One-0-0 listenin to the radio
Turnin up my stereo
I'm...
Bobbin to the beats
Headed to the beach
Calhoun
Ill be there soon with all my friends
Barbeque with Heinekens
Dont it feel good...

[Chorus]
Feels Good...
To feel the sunshine
Being with loved ones
Havin a good time
Feels Good...
To be in love
Havin someone that you can trust
Feels So good...
Spendin time wit yo kids
Showin em what feelin good is
And it feels good...
Just livin your life
Knowin everything is gonna be alright

Rollin, Jordan's
Them Twenty-three's
Top down, Hangin out
Gotta feel the breeze
Leanin back in my fresh throwback
Air Force Ones, don't you know that
Just, shine on, that tape put in
Lookin for an ATM, cause my papers thin
At the bank for my peoples
Cause I'm meetin them
And it feels good...

[chorus]

Call all the ladies, I call my guys
We can meet up and have a good time
Break out the new kicks, shine the ride
Cause we gonna roll tonight
We got grapefruits, cooked food, liquor in the cooly,
Dominos fool, no dice and spades
C'mon ya'll, it's okay
Don't it feel good...

[chorus Repeat 2x]

Feels good...
to roll the ride
top down with a dime in the passenger side
Feels Good...
To see haters eyes grillin me
Mad cause im wit you, damn why you killin me
Feels Good...
To turn my stereo up
With the beat bump bump
We just lay in the cut
And it feels good...
To know my family's okay 
So tomorrow I can say...

[chorus]

Don't you feel good...
