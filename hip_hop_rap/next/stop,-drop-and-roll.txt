Oh, it's six o'clock in the evening
I just wanna be on top with heavy breathing
Oh, baby are ya thinking what I'm thinking
I'll take off your Victoria Secrets
Yes, I just want you to undress
Roll on top, put your hands on my chest
Baby are ya ready for daddy get blessed
Stop, drop and roll with me oh yes

[1] - Stop, drop and roll with me
Baby, you know you got me in heat
I'm on fire

Now I know exactly what you're thinking
No, I'm not Dion, one of a psychic friend readers
But boo, I can tell by you moving closer
Puffin the trees, and pouring more mamosa
Baby please don't tease yourself or tease me
Daddy can freak ya completely like E.T.
Check me out, tongue in your mouth
How 'bout some in and out right now

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 1]

Everytime I think about your love
I need it
You got me heated
I need some squeezing
You make me shiver with a touch
When we clutch
I'm heating up
Hot for your love
What's his name, lets get to freakin'
There ain't no speakin'
Just heavy breathin'
Don't keep me waiting
Come on lets go
Baby stop and drop and roll 

[Repeat 1 until fade]
