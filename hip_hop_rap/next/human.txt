K. Green, B. Lincoln
There are lessons I have learned about my beauty
Did God strike me down?
Some only want me for their own devise
But are you different,
Did God strike you too?
Nobody's perfect
No, no, no nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect except we are
We are perfect for each other
Oh, I can't help it, my feelings are strong
Some will stay and some will go on
I have lived without you for so long
Now, here we are
Let God strike us down
Hey you
Won't you come and play with me tonight
I won't run away
Share your deepest darkest secrets
I can see it in your eyes you're scared
After all you're only human
After all you're only human
After all you're only...scared human
Nobody's perfect
No, no, no nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect except we are
We are perfect for each other
...Perfect
