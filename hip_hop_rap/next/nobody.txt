feat. Mysonne

[Intro]
This is a story
Though the names have been changed
The facts remain the same
On this arista track next there gonna let u know what's going on listen
You see, you always hear about a no good man
And there's alot of no good woman out here
And this story right here is gonna show just what im talking about
Now T-Low come on

[T-Low]
I always said I would never trip on no female
Found myself dropping down on your hair and your nails
I was at the mall carrying bags for instances
I was in love so I said oh well
Never thought about the money that I spent on you
So into you there was nothing that I wouldn't do
Spend mad sheets on shopping spree's
Pulled out my visa just to please ya
Oh oh yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody ever put you on a list Nobody
Let you know with ice all on your wrist
How i kiss your lips and put you in the mix
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love you
Ain't nobody ever gonna sacrifice for you come on
Put it down, the way a player do
I cant believeI cant believe the shit you put me threw
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love

[RL]
Cant believe when you suffer the way that I did
Even told me you were caring bout that im the kid
I Worked 3 jobs even broke the law
Never had second thoughts you know I never went wrongNo
9 months later a baby comes that don't even look like me
The blood that shows its real is the sweetest baby
I gave you everything and you cause me so much pain
Never have a love like mine again
Oh Oh

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody ever put u on a list Put you on, put you on
Let u know with ice all on your wrist
Ice on all your wrist Oh Oh yeah
How i kiss ur lips and put you in the mix
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love youlike I do
Ain't nobody ever gonna sacrifice for youSacrifice
Put it down, the way a player do
I cant believeI cant believe the shit you put me threw
just cant believe Oh yes
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love Break it down, break it down
Just cant believe you did this to me
One day you'll see one day you'll see
Cause Ain't nobody gonna love you

[Mysonne]
No no
Ain't nobody gonna do what I did for you
Im almost caught a bid for you
I live for you, bust my gun thats some shit for you
On the run and I hid for you thats how you do
You probably really think you played me too
When the only one you played was you
I made you boo
Before you came I played them games
So what I gave you things I gave you Rings
All the clothes the boots and shit
When all that was boosted bitch I knew you shit
Im not dumb I know your type wife in the day,
Hoe at night always Right
He told me you was sneaking hot its all good to me you died
See you bugged, I Ain't stressed
Im off to the next dime you got something good keep it next time

[Chorus]
