[Intro]
Take your clothes off
Lay down
Please
Freakin' me
And I wanna do it with the lights on
I wanna see your body
Come on my freak

Oh, do you like when I'm doin' those things
Racin' back and forth in your love lanes
Well let me unbutton your jeans
Put a towel on the bed so we don't leave no stains
I wanna do
Things to you
Things you like
I will try
Let's start tonight
I'll do it right
I'm goin' insane
I need your love things

[1] - Can I take off your shirt now baby
Can I take off your pants now too
Can I slide off your Victoria Secret
Now hush, let me just look at you
Wanna lay you down and touch your body
You're so sexy, you tie me on shorty
Got you hopin' and you got me so horney
It's just the freak in me

Hey, can I tailor your birthday suit
Clothes off, I'll take off mine too
I got major things I wanna do
Knock knock, it's me, let me inside of you
Lookin' in my eyes
Read my mind
Search and find, feel me rise
Take your time, it's alright
Just say the word so you can be 

[Repeat 1]

Come here baby
You know what I wanna do to you
Everything

Now that we're alone
Promise you will do those things
Do me 
To me
Girl come on Oh, Tweety sing
There's nothing wrong
Setting your mind and body free
Baby love me
It's the freak in me

[Repeat 1 until fade]
