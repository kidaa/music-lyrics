[female]
How do I know you wont hurt me
What makes me so different

I spent my whole life
Just wonderin around
Lost in love
Until I was found by 
you...
And I thank you
You showed me...
what What life is all about
You've turned my whole life around
Changed all that I do
It's all because of you...

[Chorus]
I threw away my players card
I put my girl before my card
I believe that I can reach the stars
It's all because of you all because of you
I swear I'll never fool around
Won't hang out late night trying to clown
Right now I wanna settle down
It's all because of you...

Lovin you
Is such a beautiful thing
Got me thinkin bout coppin you that ring
Your such a queen
You've given my life new meaning
It's like a dream
How could this be
Someone like you, for me
I've never felt more complete
Than I do when I'm with you

[Chorus]

I promise a day wont go by
That I wont say that I
That I love you love you
And I need you need you Baby
There nothin that I wont do to please you nothing, nothing
Girl, you've changed me changed me
I just wanna make you happy oooh

[Chorus]

Everything that I am everything
Everything that I'll ever be all
Is all because of you all because of you
All because of you all because of you
All because of you all because of you
All because of you all because of you
All because of you all because of you
It's all because of you all because of you
All because of you all because of you
It's all because of you all because of you
All because of you all because of you
I love you...
