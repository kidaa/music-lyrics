I Like that...

You tellin me you wanna come over
But girl I done told ya
I dont know if I could control myself
I'd love to just kiss and hold ya
Movies, popcorn, and soda
But imagine us all by ourselves
We'd be kissin, skin to skin, wearin nothin nothin
Who knows where we end help
But you can stay
If you really want...
It's Okay...

[Chorus]
It's okay
It's alright
You can spend the night
If you promise that you'll hold me
Tight
And I would like
For you to love me
Love me
Baby, it's okay
It's alright
You can spend the night
If you promise that you'll hold me
Tight
And I would like
For you to love me
Love me

I Lately I've been thinkin to myself
If I ever had you alone
What I'd do to you
What you'd do to me
Everything in between
But wait...
I don't wanna hurry you
Don't get it twisted though, Babygirl
Cause I aint scared of you
There'll be kissin kissin, skin to skin skin to skin, wearin nothin nothin
Who knows where we end help
But you can stay
If you really want...
It's Okay...

[chorus]

Cause...
Baby I wanna make love make love
But I don't wanna rush rush you
You mean everything to me though
To make you...happy...is what
What I want to do
I dreamed of this for so long
And if it's what you want
C'mon now...
kissin kissin, skin to skin, we'll be wearin nothin
Who knows where we end 
But you can stay
If you really want...
It's Okay...

First comes off the shirt

Then comes off that pants

Then comes off the bra

First comes off the shirt

Then comes off that pants 
then
Then comes off the bra

First comes off the shirt

Then comes off that pants

Then comes off the bra
