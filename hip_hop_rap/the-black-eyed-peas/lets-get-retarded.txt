In this context, there's no disrespect, so, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks.
We got five minutes for us to disconnect, from all intellect collect the rhythm effect. Obstacles are inefficient, follow
your intuition, free your inner soul and break away from tradition.
Coz when we beat out, girl it's pullin without. You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out.
Burn it till it's burned out. Turn it till it's turned out. Act up from north, west, east, south.

[Chorus:]
Everybody, everybody, let's get into it.
Get stupid.
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded.
Let's get retarded ha, let's get retarded in here. Let's get retarded ha, let's get retarded in here.
Let's get retarded ha, let's get retarded in here. Let's get retarded ha, let's get retarded in here.
Yeah.

Lose control, of body and soul.
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow.
Don't get ahead, just jump into it.
Ya'll hear about it, two peices to it.
Get stutted, get stupid.
Don't worry 'bout it, people will walk you through it.
Step by step, like an infant new kid.
Inch by inch with the new solution.
Trench men hits, with no delusion.
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'.
