I'm hard to handle like bikes with no bars 
We excite stores that got dikes leaving stores 
Unlock the heated 'cause they know when I sex well 
Left them breathless now they're waiting to exhale 
Waiting to exhale with some competition 
So come in and test well 
The next one gets hung and chip of a chisel 
I'm making chicks' nipples sizzle 
There's no question to the way I rip the riddle 
I'm awesome, I bring on monsoon when I bloom and blossom 
And run over niggas like opossums 
Froze on the road with my bike on they ? 
Man I'm warning ya, look, the Black Eyed Peas is formin up 
Ring the rhyming dope that's made up of razor blades 
Put the slice and let nice and easy humble days 
On out, over, well known Casanova 
Can I put on an army, quick to take it over 
Nine on my niggas, count all my figures 
Money on the street went entertainment 
Nowadays brothers are getting paid doing nothing 
Reciting the same line with the lame rhymes 
Frontin rappers actin like their powers over ?run em baka? 
They quick to go pop 
But when it's time to fiend for the green they flop 
We do it from the heart like blood 
Create rhymes like that flood, and blow up like a scud

My Flowation over tracks matching like no other disciples 
Rythmical action satisfaction brought to you by 'APL' 
Alligator now, 'bout to take you on a lyrical voyage 
Embarrass your form, I Recite, True ready fat 
The Alligat is on the move 
I rhyme to be exact, not exactly on the groove 
Savoire plus kinetic, My feet energetic when we set it 
You wonder why, we put our frames bodies on Calisthenics 
So check out the theory, I'm lickin'shooting off misery 
Supply you with remedies for all these sick whack MC's 
They sickest on lyrics, now time to go to work 
Dissintegrate the ignorant, Or shall I say the Jerks 
time to motivate now, Dig right to the Core 
All this sickens me, but I'll still rip it raw 
With the composition, with the position on steady 
I'm ready for the mission if he's still actin' Shitty 
Converse you with the energy enemy I focus on ya 
Every styles you make I will take and break in front of ya 
Iradicate your presence, You'll get replaced by my essence 
And sentenced to the bottomless pits that we produce 
Reduce negativity, Abilities are used 
To bruise up your brain with lyrics 
Ungh, ungh, ahh, uh, aarggh, ah, ahh, uhh 
You can bop your head like this Ha

This is who we is a 3-D, can he get back from where we enter 
Lovely entertainment's what we enter 
Feel the force, where we enter like Splinter 
Black Eyed Peas be the fools that'll injure 
Whole career and your body will be injured 
Get dealt quick, and I got one for, uh 
How you like me now 
W-I double L rippin up a style 
That's cool and calm, we droppin a bomb 
And you can nod your head to the rhythm where we are 
Some whole new uh that's well improved 
When I'm over 'cause you know I'ma relax in a rule 
That soothes your body, really really hardcore 
Double-double Ta-ta for a while or for raw 
Tap-a-tap a skill, it's the whip appeal then 
APL-APL coming-coming in with ? 
Let's rock this set exceed to terminate 
Time to eliminate the whack that you create 
Arm atticulate, when I circulate over tracks 
Let me get down and just relax 
We gettin down y'all 
We gettin down y'all 
We gettin down like this
