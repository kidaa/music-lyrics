Cannabis Sativa, ha ha, or in the heart of L.A. known as the Chronic
Not to be confused with the Bionic
Even though, it does cost six million dollars
Man, understand, ah, ha, ha
Now, we're working with some new improved shit on this track
Nevertheless, not no stress, sucker ass niggaz!!
So now we're gonna move on and uhh...
Light a big fat one up for the world; and hit this
Once or twice and you'll be twice as nice, get it?
This is the Chronic, ahh, hha, hha

Make my Bud the Chronic, I wants to get fucked
Make my shit the Chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the Chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my Bud the Chronic, before I take it home
