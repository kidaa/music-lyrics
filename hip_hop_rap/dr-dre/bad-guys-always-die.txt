[Intro]
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ah ha, ride

[Dre]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at 1
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'mma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood run cold
It's time to reload this old 45 Colt
And the wind gust, it's hot and muggy, dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
I sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I could hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'mma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head and this is what he said

[Eminem]
You never met me and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim
You want revenge? Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head, too
Cuz when you

1 -     Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
    When life ain't fun, when you're on the run
    Got your gold and you got your gun
    But life as an outlaw just begun

    Got your shotgun by your side
    Got your horse and you got your pride
    You ride 'till there ain't no place to hide
    It's sad cuz the bad guys always die

[Dre]
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said

[Eminem] 
You need bullets, hurry up run

[Dre]
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned

[Eminem] 
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want

[Dre]
I figured he was telling the truth
That's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do? It's on you

[Eminem]
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?

[Dre] 
The Chronic

[Eminem]
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it Who?
Some old dude, he's got 26 plagues and he already sold two

[Dre]
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun

[Eminem]
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us

[Dre]
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it coming

[Eminem]
He ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs and spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

[Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang in a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing
I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray
It's eighteen hundred, he proves a AK
Hollow tips started flying every which way

[Eminem]
That's when I seen Dre in trouble, then came the brigades
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plagues and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Always die
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ah ha, ride
