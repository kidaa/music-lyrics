Yes, it's coke I've laced inside every beat
Shit, I'm tryna get ya high
You been sittin in the waitin room far too long
Too late for- ay, ay, you're far too gone
I know you can't take these awful songs
Like a punk full of bullshit
Nigga hell nah
They want some real shit
They want the real
Relax, I got you
Good thing I had a couple hundred tums layin around
Nigga dispenseries, servin by the pound
Back in business, bigger than we ever was
It's aftermath nigga, you know you heard of us
We're leavin narcotics on every note
We just struttin the streets, like when the levis broke ?
I got the antidote
I got ya hands goin up and down
You done fucked up now
But it's hard to go back to that bullshit
And whatever's on the bar, Dr is gonna push it

Legs spread out, like I'm mixin a ?
