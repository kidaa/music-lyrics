[Verse One: Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Creepin down the back street on Deez

Now soon as I said it

By some nigga with a Tek 9

I make a phone call my niggas comin like the Gotti boys
bodies bein found on Greenleaf
with their fuckin heads cut off
Motherfucker I'm Dre
so listen to the play-by-play
day-by-day
rollin in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
clockin all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cuz I'm too hard to lift
and no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin D-R-E
from the CPT

Hop back as I pop my top ya trip

[Verse Two: Dre, Snoop]

Just another motherfuckin day for Dre

No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists

makes a gang of snaps
Uhh, word to the motherfuckin streets
and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
that I hit ya with
that I get ya with
as I groove in my '4 on Deez
hittin the switches
bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
but before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin like indo-nesia
bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
Cuz my '4 on hit
pancake front and back, side to side
and all that shit
so when I crawl I comes correct
now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
as I dip a nigga trip to the south side

Right back up in you it's the D-R-E
Witta ounce as we bounce thru the CPT
Diamond in the back, gators on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin in switches
Niggas gettin jealous cuz hos be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So the '4 won't blow
