I remember, wasn't so long ago 
We had a one room shack and the livin' was low 
And my mama by herself raised me and my bro 
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go 
Worked hard while the suckers cool every day 
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray 
Gave us pride to survive, really showed us the way 
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say 

She said, "Son there'll be times when the tides are high 
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry 
Just never give up 
You can never give up," uh-uh 

In this life you could lead if you only believe 
And in order to achieve what you need 
You can never give up 
You can never give up 

And this hope 
That keep me holding on 
On and on 
And this hope 
That makes me carry on 
On and on 

Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone 
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own 
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone 
And my mama for the love that made my house a home 
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be 
All this for a humble little guy like me 
And all I ever really wanted was a family 
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me 

She said, Son there'll be times when the tides are high 
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry 
Just never give up 
You can never give up, uh-uh 

In this life you could lead if you only believe 
And in order to achieve what you need 
You can never give up 
You can never give up 

And this hope 
That keep me holding on 
And on 
And this hope 
That makes me carry on 
On and on 

Me not gonna suffer, things are for better 
Never make you  by the pleasure 

See the man and watch 
Blaze like fire, we nah go retire 
Got nuff sleep and I am a expire 
We haf a retire, that we require 
We haf a make a mark before the time is gone 

And this hope 
That keep me holding on 
And on 
And this hope 
That makes me carry on 
On and on 

And this hope 
That keep me holding on 
And on 
And this hope 
That makes me carry on 
On and on 

There's hope, yeah 
Hope keeps it alive, yeah, uh 
Hope keeps it alive, yeah, uh 
And it strikes an iron, uh 
Hope keeps it alive, yeah, yeah 
Hope keeps it alive, yeah 
Only the strong survive, yeah 
Keep it carry on, keep it carry on, yeah 
Uh-uh 
I'll keep it carry on, yeah 
I gotta carry on, gotta carry on and be strong 
Uh-uh-uh 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh 

And this hope 
That keep me holding on 
And on 
And this hope 
That makes me carry on 
On and on
