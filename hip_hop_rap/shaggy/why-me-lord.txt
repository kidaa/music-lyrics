[verse 1]

Early Sunday morning in the spring of 96
Chilling on the couch watching the bulls against the knicks
My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick
It seem she found my shirt with lipstick
I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures show me some other chicks
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She ask me if I can spell the word evict 

[chorus]

Why me lord situation looking kinda bad
Why me lord I lost the best girl I ever had 
Why me lord I'm homeless and I'm feeling kinda sad 
Why me why me why me why me 
Why me lord how you member massa god so quick 
Why me lord when trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit 
Why me lord is just because you don't know when to quit 
Why me why me why me why me 

[verse 2]

Just the other day when I was rolling with my crew
Made a little flex around by flatbush avenue
Calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue
Pulled us to the side why I don't even have a clue
Looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition and a loaded thirty two
I can't believe what I'm going through 

[chorus]

Why me lord here I am I gotta face the time
Why me lord though the evidence ain't even mine 
Why me lord I swear I ain't guilty of the crime 
Why me why me why me why me 
Why me lord how you member massa god so quick 
Why me lord when trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit 
Why me lord is just because you don't know when to quit 
Why me why me why me why me

Take heed never take advantage of the thing you need 
Never let yourself be over come by greed
Walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed 
Get you act up to speed
And try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye
Everybody else deserve a piece a the pie
Honesty the best policy no sell no samfie
You no need fi wonder why 

[chorus]
