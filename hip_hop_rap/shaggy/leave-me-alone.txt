I know he's home
I just seen him go in
He's really trying to play me
What he think
It's just over like that?
It just ain't that easy
Trust me... I am not the one
Hmm Hmm Hmm... whatever... I got all night

Go Figure
How you turned out to be a real gold digger
Why you don't get it
You a pain to paint the picture bigger
You ain't my main squeeze
And it's 5 in the mornin'
Why you callin' my phone
Keep the sweater
Just leave me alone
No more love letters
Gotta blame myself
Cause I shoulda known better

Just leave me alone
Stop calling my phone
Invading my home
Why don't you leave me alone

What a bummah
Met this girl on South beach last summah
Mommie got back
But she ain't no stunnah
Chat for awhile
And I had a few drinks
Well next thing ya know
We were fogging up the hummah
No this chick's banging on my door like a drummah
Stalking my house
Decked out like a plummah
Coulda kick myself
Cause if I'd thought with my brain
I woulda left her alone
She got laced
The opportunity was right there in my face
Her dress was how she played it out
Back at my place
I wish I could go back and correct this fatal mistake
I wish she'd...

Just that girl alone
Man.. I should have never took this girls' number
Don't call her from you phone
Damn... Caller ID
Just leave that girl alone
And to think I thought this was the one
Don't dare pickup your phone
Fatal attraction... ah shhh...
