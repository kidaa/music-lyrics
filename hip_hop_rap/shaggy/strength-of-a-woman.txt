Ugh
Wah
Ugh
Ummmmm
Yo
SHAGGY
Ugh
Yo
This one goes out to all my women yah know
My strong women, ugh

[Verse 1]

So amazing how this world was made 
I wonder if GOD is a woman
The gift of life astounds me to this day
I give it up for the woman
She's the constant wind that fills my sail
Ohhhhhh that woman
With her smile and her style,my
She'll protect like a child
That's a woman

[Chorus]

She'll put a smile upon yah face
And take you to that ah higher place
So don't you under estimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

[Verse 2]

Woke up this morning 
I got up with the scent of a woman
Jus picture if you could what life would be
Ain't much good without a woman
She can nag and be a constant pain
Ohhhh that woman
But those hips she's got me whipped
And it's just to hard to resist 
What a woman
Ugh, hey

[Chorus]

Tosses in

Ugh, ugh, ugh

[Verse 3]

Tender lips that's so so sweet
Gentle words she softly speaks
Such an angel when we need
GOD bless the ground beneath her feet
She can take you on a high
Be your comfort when you cry
But if you look into her eyes
You'll see the strength of a woman
Strength of a woman
Ugh, ugh, ugh

[Chorus]

[Fade]

Strength of a woman
