Chorus

For every day and every moment Wah, Wah   
For every smile and every dream Every smile and dream   
I'll paint you a rainbow Uh, a big rainbow   
For all the joy you bring All the joy you bring   
I'll buy you a mountain A nice mountain girl   
And I'll buy you a stream Wah, uh - Ante Says 'cry' instead of 'buy'   
I'll give you a river say wah, say wah   
To show what you mean to me Uh, uh   

SHAGGY

I don't wanna sound cheesy   
But I realize that lovin' you is very easy   
Playin' in the summer sun warm and breezy   
Never talkin' sleezy oh but I love it when you give me that look ooh you lookin' so teasy - Ante says   
'Not at all sleezy...'   
Woman you are the fire in my life and it's pleasing ?? - Ante says 'freezing' instead of 'pleasing'   
Living like the Jefferson's George and Weezy   
If I am queasy, girl you're always on my mind in the darkest of times when I'm needy   
Can't get enough of you woman I'm greedy   
Sinking in the ocean of your love and I'm heeding   
Y'am conceding - Ante says 'I am conceding'   
And I wanna show you what you mean to me   

Chorus

SHAGGY

You know you have a shoulder for sighin' on, crying on - Ante says '...shoulder you can sigh on...'   
When you need your love you know it's SHAGGY ya' relyin' on - Ante says 'you're relyin on'   
Under the wings of your love that you're flyin' on   
You mean the world to me   
Cause I been with many girls and I never saw the benefit   
Now I got the love I want and by any means I'm keepin' it   
Bonafide love and I'm fallin' very deep in it   
I want the world to see   

Chorus

Now here instead of 'nice mountain' he says 'lovely mountain' and the next time the chorus comes up as well.  

SHAGGY

You're the air that I breathe, you're all that I need   
Tell me baby can you feel me   
When this life takes a toll, you're my heart and soul   
Tell me baby can you, can you feel me   

Repeat above
