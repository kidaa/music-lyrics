Intro

Now, when I'm trying to tell the truth, they always think that I'm lying  
When I be trying to tell my girl that... her friend's trying to make moves on me  
Cause they probably are  
Straight offa that you think I'm trying to hit that  
Yow girl, you know that ain't my steelo  
Whatever
SHAGGY laugh  
What's wrong yo?...ugh...ugh...  

SHAGGY

First of all, give me a break  
Why??
That's not my style that ain't how I operate  
She's the one who had step to me  
Tell me that she wanna do me  
She's your friend and she didn't hesitate  
Honey dip be dropping' mad game in my ear  
Even telling me she be with out underwear  
No WHAT????  
I don't know even know why you trippin'  
It's your girl who is kickin'  
Tryin' to get me in a one night affair  
That's what you get for runnin' out your mouth  
Talkin' to your friends lettin all my secrets out  
How I put it on in the' morn  
Work you over till dawn  
**WE NEED HIS LINE RIGHT HERE!!!!**  
Don't even stand there looking all surprised  
Didn't take long for them all to realize  
Boo, that you needed a hand  
Takin' care of your man  
You should be happy that I didn't hit the prize  
No you didn't!?!?  

Chorus

Your friend made a pass at me  
No matter what I say, you just don't believe  
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it  
But I didn't, now you mad at me  
Why?
I can't believe this  
Wahhh, Your girlfriend step to me  
No matter what I say, you just don't believe  
You know she'd be with it in a minute if I did decide to hit it  
Now you mad at me  

SHAGGY

Probably thought she was your friend  
My best friend, dammn  
Childhood buddies from the tender age of ten  
Seems swapping dolls was a game that you both used to play  
She probably thinks the same applies to men  
Not my man  
See girl, you need to know what's goin' on  
Cause I do believe that you got it all wrong  
You will have no one to blame  
Cause you didn't stake your claim  
You never know what you got til it's gone  
That's what you get for runnin' out your mouth  
So now it's my fault?!?!  
Talkin' to your friends lettin' all my secrets out  
How I put it on in the morn  
Work you over till dawn  
**WE NEED HIS LINE RIGHT HERE, Still!!!!**  
Don't even stand there looking all surprised  
Didn't take long for them all to realize  
Boo, that you needed a hand  
Takin' care of your man  
You should be happy that I didn't hit the fan  
Whatever!!!!
Why?
SHAGGY laugh  

CHORUS Here  

SHAGGY

I know you think you really know her  
Well I did  
Maybe now is the time you should try and think it over  
Hey I ain't no cassanova  
But your friend is the one who be tryin' to win me over  
Though you think you really know her  
Maybe now is the time you should try and think it over  
Yo, I ain't no cassanova  
Yeah Right  
But your friend is the one who be tryin' to win me over  

CHORUS Here  
**Third time Girl says I don't believe this
