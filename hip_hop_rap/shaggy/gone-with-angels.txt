[Shaggy talking:]
closest to me she must be a good child? 
Dont ignore the signs, thats right. 
You be her teacher,, taking. 

[Shaggy verse 1:]

Shivering she awakes in the cold sweat 
terrified so she speaks under her breathe, 
makes a fake cry for help, shes a real mess, 
thats the sign of the stress, 
ma, listen to her 
heartbeats working overtime in her chest, 
scared stiff from approaching footsteps, 
ignoring the stains on her torn dress, 
come now ma, listen to her 

[Shaggy hook:]

How could you put your own child in danger, 
and turn around and take the words of a stranger, 
you didnt wanna face the facts so you blamed her, 
too late ma, you should have listend to her 

[background vocals chorus:]

Gone, shes asleep, finally, shes at peace, the angels, gone, out of reach, finally, soon to meet, the angels. 

[Shaggy verse 2:]

Shes fading like a delicate flower, 
try to wash away the shame in the shower, 
defending him left her feeling overpowered, 
you were wrong ma, you didnt listen to her, 
it was there in the words of a letter, 
have you read that maybe things could be better, 
you let her down and I wont let you forget her, 
save ya tears ma, you should have listened to her 

[Shaggy hook:]

How could you put your own child in danger, 
and turn around and take the words of a stranger, 
you didnt wanna face the facts so you blamed her, 
save ya tears ma, you didnt listen to her.
