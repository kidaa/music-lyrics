Oh, boys getting busy 

[Repeat *] 

Ragamuffin to your love and affection 
Mr Lover will be your protection 
Sticking to you for your contention 
Anything for my Julie, ay 

We got some, mmm, make a connection 
She and me 
We be bangin' to a Shaggy selection 
One time for my Julie, ay 

** Julie 
You know me love-a you truly 
From my head down to my goolies 
You turn me on with your big babylons 
Me Julie 
You got some sweet damn coolies 
When me touch it with my goolies 
You turn me on with your big babylons 

I need a cure for this thing I'm feelin' 
Shaggy need some sexual healing 
I wanna reach and touch the ceilin' 
When I'm lovin' my Julie, ay 

Me I've been kickin' at my late night dealin' 
Words at the piece I'm stealin' 
I see your sex and Mr Lover believin' 
When I'm lovin' my Julie 

[Repeat **] 

Hey, Shaggy, I can rap too 

You is better than J-Lo, next to you she is just a minger 
Better than Destiny's Child, well, apart from the lead singer 
You is fitter than the Spice Girls including the Ging'er 
Give it a shave, 'cos me wanna be in yer 

They always claimed that our love was wrong, uh 
The people just stared and said it was too long, but 
It ain't crap to have a 12-inch 
Dong, d-dong, dong, dong
