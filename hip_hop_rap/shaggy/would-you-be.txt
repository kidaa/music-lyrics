Ohhhhhh...... 
Baby I hope you dun get offended in anyway ya know 
But your beauty is so 
Magnificent 
I'm just tempted to touch ya know 
Yo bebe jus a meks sha a gwaan now?? 

[Brian Gold - Chorus]
Would you be offended if I told ya 
I like the way you lick your lips 
Would u be offended if I showed ya 
How I like to work those hips 
Is it a rude for mi to wink 
An let you know I like what I see 
Would u be offended if I touch ya 
Imagine how it could be 

[Shaggy - Verse 1]
Your like a jewel baby 
This ain't no pick up line 
Epitome of a lady 
Truly one of a kind 
Wear a precious diamond 
Wid all dem polish shine? 
Can't wait to hold u closer 
Can u read my mind 
later images for which I won't apologize 
I hope that u can see the passion in my eyes 
Won't over step our boundries 
These words are hard to find 
Stated my intentions 
Hope you my way inclined 

[Brian Gold]
Tell me if im wrong 
expressing how I feel 
how can I go on 
if I don't know the deal 

Would you be offended if I told ya 
I like the way you lick your lips 
Would u be offended if I showed ya 
How I like to work those hips 
Is it a rude for mi to wink 
An let you know I like what I see 
Would u be offended if I touch ya 
imagine how it could be 

[Shaggy - Verse 2]
No need to be embarrassed 
I know you feel the same 
You feel my record 
Can I say this ain't no players game 
You feel the spark between us 
come lets ignite the flame 
coz if you let it pass 
we'll only have ourselves to blame 
showing you a world of pleasure 
that's my only aim 
I wanna take ya to the clouds 
an let you scream my name 
this is your decision 
baby stake your claim 
take a chance 
coz if you don't den it would be a shame 

[Brian Gold]
Tell me am im wrong
