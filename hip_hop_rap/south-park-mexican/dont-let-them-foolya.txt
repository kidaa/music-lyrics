[Baby Beesh and Grimm - chorus 2x] 

Don't let them foolya 
We just come to school ya 
Glory Glory haleloya 
No red against no blue 
You know you know 

[Verse 1 Baby Beesh] 

Now you livin that fast track 
Chasin that ass crack 
I be making my money fucking with the Jones and Nasdaq 
We be blowin on fat sacks 
And cacthing amnesia with these heaters 
Making beleivers out of haters and cheaters 
You know that violence interupts my dope trade 
I just do the herb no cocaine 
Don't be afraid boy 
To be all about your bread boy 
But wacth the devil cuase the devil he's decoy 
Destroy all the hate in your veins 
Count your change and rearrange 
Them games is played out man 
Them dirty macks they to stop me but I'm a player profit 
I get the dope cook it up and rechop it 

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2 South Park Mexican] 
Smoking smelly 
Put a hole in your belly 
You wan't to test us oh really 
Got a call on my celley 
They wan't to bury us 
You fucking haters sound halerious 
The I turn the brave into the sariest 
Smoke water and get wetter than aquarious 
Thuggish Ruggish million dollar budgets 
I chop a bird and cook 36 chicken nuggets 
My future is clear just like a shot of vodka 
I got love from Corrpitos to Uganda 
If you jelous listen up fellas 
It's no problem to show you where hell is 

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3 Rasheed] 
While some niggas is stickin with ya 
Your murder is being choreographed 
Soldiers never sleep I got your back in the aftermath 
After the last laugh 
When the mutherfuckers smoke clears 
Niggas broke hear 
Choking hanging like chandliers 
I bust at the man in the mirror 
Making my face crack 
Replace that Rasheed dope house killa 
Keep it coming back or running back 
With a ball and chain in my hand 
Ain't no substain 
The man with the vision of the galexy span 

[Verse 4 Low G] 
Respect that 
It's the million dollar wetback 
In jet black 
You cross my line and get your head cracked 
Yea yea ya tu sabes qien soy 
Don't sweat me boy 
Ya tu sabes donde estoy 
I'm on the Hunt G 
The only street with the palm tree's 
It's Low G 
I only rap about what's done g 
You can't stop me 
Came to your city on a donkey 
The slavea I'm bringing back the wet flava 

[Chorus 2x]

[South Park Mexican] 
He's on crack 
She's on snow 
He's so old he can't fuck no mo 
She's a whore he's a snicth 
Most of my niggas dying over a bicth
