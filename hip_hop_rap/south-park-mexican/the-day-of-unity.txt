[SPM:] Thinking bout my baby girl, Thinking bout my baby girl [Echoes]

[SPM Verse one:]
Thinking bout my baby girl 
Growing up by herself in this shady world
She got a good mom and I hope that 
Everything will be fine 'til I'm home black
Up in this prison cant do much 
With my homies and is my turn to cook lunch 
Listen my children I cant believe 
what this muthafuckas doing to my family 
But I stay strong and I keep my faith 
even though I'm thuggin 'til I see my grave
Momma dont worry about your youngest son 
You should know that I never was the lucky one 
sadness was all that I was delt right? 
Happiness never knew what it felt like 
But I know I cant be held back 
Like they did me in the 6th grade memba that? [Laughs]

[Carolyn Hook:]
Today they love what they see our people killin one another 
[SPM In the background:]
8 Bar hooks... But I'm just gonna do 4 know what I'm saying cuz I gotta to do this 

[Carolyn continue hook:]
They fear the day of unity the day our people come together 

[SPM Verse Two:]
I know the primege should never have a favorite child 
But my Carley just so crazy and wild 
My only daughter she's daddy's girl 
And for her I'll buy the whole Astro world
But she dont want money she just wants me there 
To watch her play piano or brush her hair 
And I know theres a million kids 
That feel the same pain that my children's in 
45 Years cuz they hate a G
To brake loose from this modern day slavery 
They wanna sent the cage making minumum wage 
Thats how this muthafuckin system was made 
I lift weights I play handball 
I write carley I write my grandma 
I'm writting a movie and I'm sending a copy 
To Edward James Olmos this hoes cant stop me 

[Hook 1x]

[SPM Verse Three:]
You got Tango and you got Famas 
You got vatos that cry for they mommas 
You got soldados that handle they bizz 
You got people that cant recognize they kids 
You got homiez coming in on the straight 5 
Put some work in now he gotta face life 
Thats 40 years before he on parole 
Is all in the sopa he aint coming home 
This is the belly of the beast the semen jungle 
The drunk driver that kill my homiez niece and uncle 
Just walks right by me should I straight floor em 
Naw homie instead im gonna pray for em 
In 7 weeks when this album hits the streets 
They'll be pist at me cuz I made history 
I speak from the place they stuck my race 
But revenge is the sweetest muthafucking taste 

[Hook 2x]
