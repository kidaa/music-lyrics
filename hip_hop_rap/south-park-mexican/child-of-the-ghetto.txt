a child of the ghetto

in my back yard
is now where my weed grow
i make the block bleed 
servin fiends in need
i did my first murder 
at the age of seven-teen
so now it's biziteen
imagen pinkie ring
choppen up the scene
candy coated limisune
so whatcha wanna see
i'm ballin at twenty-three
sippin down pea

from Houston to San Anton

bustin ballas at your dome

sittin all alone
