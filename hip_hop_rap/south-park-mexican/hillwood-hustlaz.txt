[Chorus: Grimm]
Boy ya neva shoulda fucked with uuus
We da Hillwood hustlaaaaaz
Niggas known for bustin sluuugs
Makin money sellin sluts and druuugs

[Verse 1: SPM]
I'ma motherfuckin Hillwood cowboy
Falfuria raised Mr. C. Coy, a.k.a. El Coyote
Creepin slow through the monte
Peace to my niggas in the grave and the bote
Ponte quidao, bow wow wow
Soy el mujado de sulda Hustletown
Blue and White Porche 
60,000 dolla horse
At my ranch where my butt naked maids do my chores
I slap all the demons
Get weighed on triple beamas
I got a "Dirty Harry" plus a pair of purdy Ninas
Raised on the south side of Houston
Fuck with the click and shit'll get gruesome
Quick execution 
Day of revolution
Moms wanna send me to anotha institution 
Life is so precious
Why would you test this?
Mex out of Tex with 7 s-k-s's partna

[Chorus: Grimm]
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2: Rasheed]
They call me Rasheed
I smoke the bomb weed
I came up off my feet cause I make my block bleed
It mus be on G
All greed cause my boys rob ki's
Im'a cha chi ever rub her clock these
I never buy g's 
Leave em bloody by deeezzz
Put them in the back of a stolen Marquis
Call the cops please cause this muthafucka smell
The ringin in my ear sound like bell bells
Well this is farewell
I park parallel
Walk to the park and smoke on the carousel
We play hide and seek 
And then freeze tag
But the tag on ya toe in a police bag
Blow green grass
But still I think fast
Fuck a bitch
Put a whole in his little pink ass
4 5 don't lie
Don't jive
Takin hoes lives
Run up in my face and take a nose dive
Causea.

[Chorus: Grimm]
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 3: SPM]
26 pistols
17 missiles
Take em all to school and give em early dismissal
No referees or whistles 
Jus be the craziest
I'm in the studio like Julio Iglesias
I break truce
Blast and chunk deuce
Make a few calls 
Tell em "Let the dogs loose"
44 troops
Camouflage and black boots
The games will begin when the 1st man shoots
Separate in groups 
Go as low as you can stoop
Put a hole in they ass like a fuckin fruit loop
Shoot to kill
Make em puke and squeal
Catch em while they sleepin in they Coupe Deville
My crew is real and after ya do dis deal
I'ma take ya niggas on vacation to Brazil
Lucious steal
At the ship channel bridge
And remember the rule
No woman no kids

[Chorus: Grimm]
[Repeat 2x]
