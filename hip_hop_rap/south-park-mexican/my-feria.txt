[Intro DJ Kane:]
Ooh, Feria 
Oh, oh, oh, My Feria 

[Chorus DJ Kane: repeat 2X]
I'm in love with my feria 
What I would for my feria 
I stay true to my feria 
Because my feria loves me 

[1st Verse SPM:]
I got a fat girl, With a big ol' face 
And "In God we trust" tattooed around her waist 
Helped me beat a dope case 
And she paid off the judge 
I bet her on the Cubs and the Phoenix Suns 
Her name is Cashola way over Maria 
She bought me a casino in South Korea 
How we roll, You have no-oh idea 
She runs with hoes like Christina "La Bolia" 
She never bounce like a check 
Put a ounce in my vet 
Got a house and a jet 
She my spouse and my friend 
Put my cousin through college and bought my grandma a lil' ranch 
She crazy 
Always chase me tryna get in my pants 
Ha, Ha! 

[Chorus 2x]

[2nd Verse SPM:]
She come from a tree but she ain't Mary Jane 
I'm talkin' 'bout my paper, Maan! 
Never fake or counterfeit, My madamoiselle 
Bought me snacks up in jail 
Until they granted me bail 
My jew-els 
Surround my platinum gazelles 
She can't spell but she can sure count well 
Record sales make her swell 
Bought my first two twelves 
My first sound system bang and rock the bells 
Lock and load, Clock and fold 
Pocket swoll' 
Rock n' roll out the door 
For pots of gold 
Congratulator shoot haters like Space Invaders 
So much feria I bought a swimming pool for my neighbors 

[Chorus 2x]

[3rd Verse Baby Beesh:]
Now we gonna ride like the wind 
My lover, my dividend 
She my feria, I'm her daddy, and she my best friend 
Got me spending weekends in Kingston Jamaica 
Ooh my fettucini, Ooh I love my paper 
When she get outta line 
Papi gonna get on her grind 
Facing penitentiary time 
But she's eventually mine 
Same color as my hydro 
I swear to God the only bitch I'll ever die for 
Or rob for 

[4th Verse Low-G:]
I go to war for my peso 
My queso 
My villete's, Que bella 
Te miras como una estrella 
Da' playa' 
El jugador 
El fumador 
Todo mundo sabe lo que haria por tu amor 
Oye chico 
You got my federico 
Pobrecito 
Now I gotta call my primo 
El Cochino 
Suck the blood like Dracula 
I'm in the hood flippin' cookies with my spatula 

[Chorus 2x]
