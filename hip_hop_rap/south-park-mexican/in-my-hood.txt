[Verse 1:] 
One Two Buckle That Fool,
He's Fucking With Me, If He's Fucking With You 
Hillwood To My Bones, To My Chromozomes
Got 2 44's So Im Not Home Alone 
Push a Pencil Like A Stone On A Saturday Night
I Choke a hoe From My Tow Like Im Grabbing The Mic 
They Bought Me A Used Dirt Bike
A Year Later It Was Used To Serve White 
Ghetto Bird On Top Of Us,punk ass Officers
Mad Cause My Closet Full Of Guns & Nauticas 
Rocking Up Duckies,For Fiends And Jumbies
Got More Cheese Than Chuckies,And Get My weed From Uglies 
I'ts All Lovely,Just Bought A Pitbull Puppy
That's Guaranteed To Make Me A Shit Full Of Money 
Man I Just Couldn't Study,In School I Was Nervous
So I Left I Cant even Write In Cursive. 

[Chorus:] 
What Do You See In My Hood, I See Gangstas Everywhere Everry wherrre [x2] 

[Verse 2:] 
And Im Going Live,Liver Than The Rest,
I Told My Mom While Im Lock Take It As A Test 
Up In Garza West Smokin On A Skinny Square 
Three More And I believe I Can Get Me There 
Ill Be Home Soon I Promise That,
I Be Trippin Cause Now They Say My Daughter Rap 
7 Years Old Im 8 Now Dad,They Say She Real Cold,
She My Muthafuckin Life For Real Dow 
Lord Knows That He Got Me Here For A Reason,
What It Is I Dont Know But Yo Boy Breathin, 
They Dint Kill Me So Now Them hoes Gotta Feel Me,
I Been Slangin Since I Got Kicked Out Of Milby
Last Ten Years Been A Cold Jungle,
In The Streets Sellin Dope To My Own Uncle 
Born Thug They Gon Hate Me Till Im Bagged Up,
Im My Casket Ill Probally Still Be Handcuffed. 

[Chrorus x1] 

[Verse 3:] 
I Come From The Slums,Southside Houston,
Changed To Screwston,The Day Screwed Moved On 
And I Miss Em,Wish I Could Hug And Kiss Em,
He Was Asking For Help But No One Would Listen
Reminisim Acting Like A Fool At Roxy,
Jealouse Niggaz Looking But Refuse To Box Me 
I Dont Blame Em Dow,I Would Jump On Stage And Flow,
And Holla Fuck The Police And The Radio 
They Cant Stop Me,But Certainly Them hoes Can Try,
I Started Dope House Back When I Was Smoking Fry 
In The Penn I Just Wish I Had One Made,
I Swear To GOD these hoes Hate To See Us Paid 
Just Made Mix-Bread With Roastbeef
Got My Boy Pullin Meat Out His Gold Teeth 
On The Mic I Destroy Any Earthaleen,
My New Song Called pussy meat In Burger King. 

[Chorus x2]
