Helena
I love you baby
Sodapop

You take the breath from me
Make my life heavenly
I can't believe the way the good Lord is blessin' me
One in a million, mother of my children
Me without you like car without engine
You listen to my dreams that I vision
Respect that I smoke Mary Jane, it's like my religion
The pigeons, sometimes make you worry
But I can see, you know my vision ain't blurry
The innocence, still strong like a feminist
I reminisce, on the first time we ever kissed
In the devilish world you my only angel
Cancel concerts to stay with you and watch cable
Kiss your navel, candlelights on the table
You never cared if I was financially stable
12 years, to me it feels like 12 minutes
My love for you, sees no limits

[Chorus:]
Where would I be without you?
I know I wouldn't be rappin' into soundproof
I know I wouldn't be pushin' a Benz
I'd probably be gettin' transferred, to different pens
Or chillin' with my dead friends
Or still at the weed house makin' 5's and 10's
Miss Perfect, God-given
When I was lost, you made my life worth livin'

They say nothing on this earth is perfect
I don't believe it, you never cheated
Perfect record, undefeated
I needed a miracle to save my life
When I was hustlin' and grindin' late at night
I paid the price and listened to you bitchin' me
You start bringing up the past, that's history
Never again will I jeopardize
That's a promise that I'll memorize
Real love never dies
It's paradise, no matter where we at
The movies, the club, Six Flags, the Super Track
I was a dropout, no education whatsoever
But you stuck with me through all kinds of fucked up weather
Hoping days'll get better like I said they would
They said "Stand by your man", and there you stood
I was 17, now I'm 29
And I pray you'll be mine 'til the end of time

[Chorus]

- Yo Ike'
- What's the deal Los?
- I know you feel me on this song, baby
- Man, for sure, my nigga, I got some for this
- Go on, wreck it, homie

Man, I'm at that point in my life, I lost my kids and my wife
And I been thinking was shife when I been up at the night
So I be takin' a ride and I be thinkin' inside
And I be wantin' to die cause I be wonderin' why
But now I know it's too late and all I got is my fate
And I be thinkin' real deep about my kids when they sleep
And where the hell I went wrong, and how to hell to stay strong
Cause now my babies they gone, and all I got is this song
Try to make it all right, but not for them but for Ike
And if I have one more night that I can treasure the life
I know I do it all right with just my kids and my wife
One night alone with no fights, with Kim just huggin' me tight
Miss Perfect

[Chorus]
