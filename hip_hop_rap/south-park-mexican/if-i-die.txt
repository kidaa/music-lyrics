Persecuted by the world 
all I want is my baby girl 
in my arms braided up on pretty curls
Keep the fame and the fortune I don't need it
is to many out there wanna see me bleedin, 
as I wake up stuck in time
in this place people loose they fucken mind
I see shadows in the night of demons dancing 
most penitentiaries overseen by clansmen 
Stay strong even though it's hard 
keep my head up and stay close to GOD 
I see friends I knew back in school 
they ain't the same covered up in tattoos
In the land of the free I'm forever known 
look up at the sky and pretend I'm home
Dear Lord I know you got a plan for me 
but I'd rather be at home with my family 

[HOOK x2] 

If I die momma don't loose your mind
stay strong the world don't accept my kind
I was born hate free always been different 
It's hard to stay alive when you're brown and gifted

I understand it in due time my life is going to slide behind 
the curtain of uncertainty the pearly gates to the fire, 
cuz I'm a rambling man, a gambling man 
so when the shit hits the fan my plan is to stand as a man, 
my canvas is bland painted the perfect picture
but my tears made the paint run; I need an eraser but shit ain't one,
the critics looking at the picture saying it feels dark 
but you critickin my art baby is still art
I know some people that respect me for me 
I know some people that neglect me for me
And so it pans out so now when I pass 
and the last of my breath has been breathed at ease
Momma don't cry for me I'm watching over you 
I'm still doing the same thing your son is opposed to do, 
so if you love me love me and everything is fine 
we're gonna reunite in the sky and do time 

[HOOK] 

I tried to tell you that these motherfuckers wanted my soul, 
hate me till I'm dead and gone but in love with my dough, 
as they listen to my cd that they got from somebody 
I can't believe that he is saying this in custody, 
doesn't he realize we got him right were we want him 
I was warned by a prisoner they'll be coming, 
can you imagine life without rats
that back stab their own to try get were they at? 
I made millions but felt I was never rich,
how can greed make people be so devilish?
I wrote a book entitled they can't stop
took about 20 pens and a lot of coffee, 
they hit me up with some years and a small fine 
it's gonna be the greatest comeback of all time 
and all I got left is true fans 
cuz my horoscope said that my bitch found a new man
