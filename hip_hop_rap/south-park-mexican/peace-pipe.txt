[Intro]
What's really going on?
My people we gonna rise
If we just open our eyes
Can you see who makes us weak?
Killing each other for a color
Right now as I speak
Understand the cowards act fools
But the bravest of all men obey god's rules...

[Carlos Coy]
I see my streets full of hustlers selling dope
Creeping trophy trucks and buss off killer smoke
I see older folks turn away
they disgusted all the money that I earn a day
And they've been busted but everybody payed for
The way they live may I be on my way lord
I make a wish, I see mothers on crack
G'z gotta serve them everybody wanna stack
Keys it don't hurt them cold blooded will it ever be?
Ain't no love you can die and still never see
That the blood that you're spilling is your own kind
Now take a look who you killing when you go blind
All the years selling bricks black taught me well
That life only gives back who you can sell
And this message is colored by asperity
So out of lessons these streets wanna marry me
And it's on...

[Chorus:]
We're gonna take control
Take our place on the totem pole
you know we got to blow
That peace pipe, peace pipe...
We're gonna take control
No matter where we go
you know we got to blow
That peace pipe, peace pipe...

[Lil Russ]
Stop the greed as I proceed to blaze
And recollect my thoughts, 'cause we living in the last stage
Of revelations doomed for a devastation
So before I die, I'm gonna bring about this unification
Spread love all across the whole nation
Sheeting tears for my peers and all this shit we facing
'cause lord knows, this mexicano had it bad
Just like the rest of my people had in the past
They've been in misery suffering through property
But I'm gonna help my fella brothers through this trouble G
Lil' Russ well let it be known worldwide
So I'm gonna reunite mi gente till we unify

[Chorus]

[Carlos Coy]
Bandannas flagging everywhere, claiming sets
Gangstas playing double dare, aiming techs
Many people heard of me when I was lost
Involved with a dirty deed with nino Ross
Homies was the full dad
I was at the party with my steel hammer pulled back
Thank god he turned into a better man my second chance
But I don't think I ever can forget the past
We was kids playing football having fun
Now we playing 'shooting you all' with real guns
One time for my dead friends I do my best
So the trigger happy trend ends
So you may rest...

[Chorus]
