[Chorus: South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet with sortened hair
and when a sweet I need to be there
I need a sweet hear what say
a killa sweet to get me through the day - help me out
I need a sweet I really do
I need a sweet can I smoke a few
I need a sweet to get me right
I need a sweet everyday and everynight

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet so I can blow
a forty dolla sweet fill with endo
I got a buzz unnh hunnh that's why I does
I put diamonds on my daughter's hairbrush
in this times of hate and pain
we need a remedy to get us out the rain
jealousy a little greed
I been thinkin' of what I need
purple leaves with crystal flakes
if that's not hydro lease get that out my face
two-twenty five for a half of o-z
in the club with my homeboy joey t
my science project was in the school arena
cuz I made a bomb out this old steam cleana
come on

[Chorus: South Park Mexican]

[Verse 2: Angela Perez]
I need a sweet to calm my nerves
a swisha sweet filled with killa herbs
I wanna fill it, roll it, hit it, smoke it hydro ponics
no matter what time... I just wanna high
but wait when the things obscene
always wanna smoke like a dimnagy
muthafuckes call me miss big cheat
but I don't give a fuck cuz I love my weed
step up to the club to the vip

[Verse 3: Baby Beesh]
I need an s to the w-e-e-t

if you want that dope I got a bowl dough
my girl got more baby+momma+in a chokehold

I hope so I need to pay my rent
split-n-split the mero mero-

[Chorus: South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet with sortened hair
and when a sweet I need to be there
I need a sweet hear what say
a killa sweet to get me through the day - help me out
I need a sweet I really do
I need a sweet can I smoke a few
I need a sweet to get me right
I need a sweet everyday and everynight
