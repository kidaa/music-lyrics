[";So much drama in the..."; -- Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Verse One: Ras Kass

No disrespect to the opposite sex
But I ain't flexed punani yet that's worth my royalty checks
Men be trying to get laid, women be trying to get paid
So, somebody gotta get played... {right}
Now you claim I'm runnin game and still let us run the train
Pulling Coolio's braids, it wasn't me, it was the fame
Let a dame complain about disrespecting my African queen
Ass hangin out them Daisy Dukes jeans, jockin
Damn I love civilization
Wants to know my occupation home location and means of transportation
The correct combination unlocked your placenta
I got a cellular phone with a rubber antenna
on a three story house, drive a four door Ac
Favorite song of all time Mobb Deep's ";Hit It From the Back";
Then jet, I turn a bitch into my favorite
She know my name cause I got more game than Sega CD

Chorus: Coolio, Ras Kass

You know it's drama, but it sound real good 3X
        You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back
You know it's drama, but it sound real good 3X
        You knew the game, and you still ended up on your back

Verse Two: Ras Kass

I try U.N.I.T.Y. but why?
Cause when I was lackin, bitches made me want to roll over and die
So now I lie, cause bitches are like flies {why?}
They attract to the best shit {oh!}
You gotta play Max Julian's role unless you plan on being celibate
Cause bitches want the money clip and whatever dick that comes with it
{The bitch} saw me in the Lex and didn't know it came from Avis
Now she's on the Tip like my name was John Davis
And I'm knowin what she thinks {what?}
I'ma sweep her off her feet because I bought the hoe a drink
Bitch, haha yeah I'm living nice, got a two o'clock flight to Atlanta
{Tomorrow} so maybe we can kick it {tonight}
Right there I knew my dick was getting wetted
Cause I played into this bitch's Cinderella complex
Whatever you want to hear, I can say
Forget the bitch the next day, instant replay

Chorus

Verse Three: Coolio

Yo Ras, let me talk about these bitches for a minute
But let's get it straight, when I say the word bitch
I don't mean all women
Cause hookers come a dime a dozen if you thought they wasn't
You can hit this hoe today, and tomorrow you can hit her cousin
Or her mama, you gots to have drama
Nigga flash some currency and go up in her auntie!
I'm talkin bout the skanless type loc
You know the type that seem to like the taste of swipe
Check it
When it comes to Saving Hoes Coolio ain't in it
Don't call me Captain, general, sergeant, or lieutenant
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
I gave the bitch my autograph, and she gave me some ass
But as soon as the hoe tried to get in my pocket
I shot her ass away from me *schch* like a skyrocket
Take it from a G, period, no comma, to keep these hookers
on they toes... you know the rest

Chorus
