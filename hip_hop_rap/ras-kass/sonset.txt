Hook/Chorus:

Now I'm a rap fan who never saw Bam Rock the park
In the Bronx but I still snap skulls in the dark

So can you recoginze shit is real
When I shove this ampex 4 9 9 up your rectum
I'm ready to bust every bitch niggas cherry
See these floods in January got me lookin' in the mirror
Screamin' Bloody Mary
Unnecessary representin' equal set trippin'
Divided by my tennis hoe pimpin'
Got all ya'll niggas dippin', like Lipton Tea Bags, son
His stilo Jeet Kune Do the way of the intercepting fist
Intercepting every sublimial dis
Geographic, prejudice against increments of incredulos legislature
Pschologically, I masturbate with the hands of fate
So bust nuts on Mother Nature coming on your landscape
I'm pressing California license plate
For niggas in all 50 fucking states
But its biting me and fighting me
Inviting me to rhyme I can't hold it back
I'm lookin' for the line
Takin' off my lamb skin, Marc Buchanan
Cause I'm a make you see L.A. U.C.L.A. like Ed O'Bannon
Nigga come in peace and brothers can kick it
But you ain't gonna walk me streets
When back east you sellin' wolf tickets
Reciprocate the player hatin'
Bring the bullshit to you
Going through yo coast, like the Green Gar GNU
Who said no is good gnews
But gniggas is gnot gnowing about the gnext shit that I be flowin'
So don't represent at my expense
It's too expensive
The first and last line of my definse is my sentence
You got causght off the coast of the Pacific Ocean
Found face down floatin'
With yo' fuckin' neck broken

Hook

I walk the planet and create tremors
If nnuttin' else here's all you need to remember
LLA'Y LLA KCUF for all you backwards niggas
Pschologically, we grapple an MC
Like Gracie at the UFC so place me in your octagon
Coward on mix tapes and interviews, I be hearing you
Certain dissiden'ts dis from a distance
Disresect and discriminate
Bitch I laminate that ass
And wear it at the New Music Seminar for a badge
Mash or get twisted
Dem gwan front like Rosa Parks
But them marks is broke wristed bytch
YOu got superiority complex
Based on old statisitics, now listen
Respect due to the pioneers
But what you burrogh did in 83'
Is ancient history brah'
So why these niggas actin' like
Since they live in the state
That rap originates
They automatically, all time greats?
It takes classic material to phat shit

Hook

Not proof of New York residence and an accent
Who expresses the freshest the
West Coast was ressurcted
By me, I'm the mother fuckin' man like homo erectus
So why it matter where rap started
If I wanted to hear from asshole I would have farted
I'm a West Coast artist down wit' clicks from 510 to 516
But dis indiscriminately and you sid me
Fundamentally is the ability to smother suckas
So if rap was born to another then that makes me your mothas-fucka
Cause I'm the type of nigga to go to yo' show
Fuck yo' ho
Then nut on yo' promotional T-shirt
Eternally, verbally I fucks your head up like
Florence and Normandie Easily I approach

Hook: repeat 8X
