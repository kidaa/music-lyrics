Intro:
What? Nigga, You got problems?
Nigga you don't want no problems with me, shit
Nigga you ain't got enough calcium to have a bone to pick coward
You little bitch ass nigga, niggas be hovering niggas be bothering you
I aun't fuckin' with y'all, I ain't fuckin with you
I guess I got a bad attitude

Verse 1:
I spit slick shit like K-Y Jelly
Out for the mail like Melly
I'm fucking you tonight before Kelly
My bitches dance with there belly 
And fuck me with there eyes
See crime is where they organize
In the land of the blind the one eyed is genie
A male chauvinist keep them barefoot in a two piece bikini
Need a bulletproof beenie when niggas got five minutes of funk
make them disappear like Houdini or who-done-it a Whoridah 
Got old folks scared just to go outside on there front porch
And all this bullshit is going on in church of course
but but but but but wait it gets worse!
I could still instill a semi-automatic verse
And draw blood like a nurse
Correspond like ???? ???? and on the mic I bomb like nuclear fission
Alphabetic mathematician your prerogative is my decision
My litigation gives me a reputation for giving niggas no get back like black reparations
You're doing too much 'cause I'm going to be rich nigga I put that on my two nuts 

Chorus:  
I ain't fuckin' with you You're not to be fucked with
Big nigga I though you knew
Cause we find this niggas mood is rude 
But I know the Cause of your shitty attitude

Verse 2:
Now whenever I'm fed up we can go head up
My ex bitch called me a dog so I piss with one leg up 
straight up and down three hundred and sixty-five rounds
one in the chamber for leap year keep clear
I get my hands dirty like a sanitation worker so what's beef?
Beef is that meat inside a hamburger and man-murder I stand further apart
And Beat more rappers than Dr. Dre, Mo-Bee, Dimond Dee, and Mark Sparx All Producers
The quintessential micaphonist smoke the 50 thousand dollar bonus
Swarming your green like locus 
Your vegetation was supposed to be edumacation
Left a nigga feeling like he's stranded in Serbia and he's the only Croatians
No relation that's my justification for ripping niggas 
Stripping niggas bigga figgas tippin strippers
In the First King in the cut like scissors
Shoot her to the point and long dick her
Bang her to the point of exhaustion truly
I ride her like that pony song and flip her Flipper like a dolphin movie
Listen no anal sex and no kissing
Doggystyles my favorite position
Insisting that you grab your ankles and lay face down bitch
Play like cuss words on the radio and turn that ass around aww TIHS!
I puts it down like Davie though it's all gravy though
Priority records got to pay me though but

Chorus:

Now when it's on then it's on no shame in my game
Cowards wouldn't bust a grape if there name were Champaign
I change lanes on dirtbikes and change direction at the speed of light
I use my feet to catch the dice niggas gamble everyday anyway
Paying the price of life kill a fifth of E and J everynight
Got to be right to be impolite I've been mad
So how the fuck I'm supposed to keep my act clean like Sinbad
See white people burn your church
The see you in the mall and clutch there purse
Treat a nigga like dirt when the black man was here first
That's why I be on one officially
fuck white people in general and fuck the police specifically
You got at me but you're missing me sideways
So I'm giving rappers a curfew like I gave birth to you
Don't be calling them shit shades when you know that its curtains for you
I'm certain I'm hurting a few ego's Toni's, Mark's, and Nino's
Stompin with the big Dog Pino, see though
I'll pull your card and get your chips like I'm Kino
From Yugoslavia to Reno, Yeah homie we know

Chorus 3X
