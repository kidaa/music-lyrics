1st verse:
You don't want to speak my name
Mes around and get that ass blown away
BLAAAH!
Full gon' away
I neva like ya tail anyway
Missy got somethin to say
I ride down the block in an Escalade
Bling, bling all in ya face
I think you might need to put on ya shades
RAH!
I know you feel me though 
Ya hatin on me but you hear me though
20"; rims sittin crazy low 
AHHHH! I'ma crazy hoe.
I'ma keep the party live
Me and Timbaland gon' flip it tonight
Keep ya hands in the sky
Wave 'em round like ya crazy high. 
2nd verse:
You don't know who I be 
Ya mammy neva told you not to fuck wit' me
If I give ya head you'll neva leave
RAH!
Stop sweatin' me
Flip it on the black hand side
Look here boy don't you even try
Make me dislocate ya spine
Me rings put the shine like turkemtide
What you comin' round here now fo'
Baby hell no you just want my doe
Get ya black as on the flo'
Fool touch me that's a no, no
RAH!
Mr. DJ won't you play that song 
Tell them freaks shake they nasty thongs 
Hay boys won't you sing along
'Cause we gon' rock the party 'till the early morn.
