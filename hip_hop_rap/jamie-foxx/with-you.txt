Girl I got to get...

Have you ever been to Spain in the slow lane,
Holdin' your name, play n bet it like no pain no gain
Let me show you wot your body is made fo',
everything is on me its all paid fo'
bubble up, get in trouble up, and raise your level up come on, come on
Put your heart in, I bet your pardon,
A flower in my secret garden,

Girl I got to get...

I been thinking for the longest time,
All your blowing trees or on that wine,
why you act like I, can't be the only one for you, yeah,
and everytime I try to walk away,
you put that ass on me and make me stay,
girl I'm feeling so deceived,
you got me feeling so confused, Oooh,
I got to get with you

[Hook]
Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze,
pop bottles on the regular,
I toast the good smoke, meet your kin folks,
and try to get next to ya,
Good life the lime light, Head down south,
and get ya mind right,
sex so good you cant believe it,
later on we can have some kids, thats what it is, Whoa

I'm not a playa but I'm still a man,
There's just some things you gotta understand
Girl you know I ride for you,
But sometimes you just put me through,
Sooo much, when I wanna get with you
and I know that if you get your way if you get your way
you'll have me fiendin' for ya every day,
your smile, your kiss, your love, that exists for me, oooh,
When I wanna get with you

[Hook]
Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze,
pop bottles on the regular,
I toast the good smoke, meet your kin folks,
and try to get next to ya,
Good life the lime light, Head down south,
and get ya mind right,
sex so good you cant believe it,
later on we can have some kids, thats what it is, Whoa

Now let The Game begin!

Next to you, your Lexus coupe,
My four door Bentley, that Dre just sent me
Millionaire boys club, and my wrist freeze,
me and Jacob got an understandin', I don't spend cheese,
And I don't see no rock on ya hand,
So my question to you is, where's ya man?
She said he been doing movies lately,
And Game you got a baby face,
then she split like Tracy,
I don't chase em I replace em,
Let em runaway, Watch em come back like ma$e and,
She an ATL freak, she get A town stomped,
But she never been fucked on the beach,
In silk Channel sheets, and it feel good baby,
she looked back at me and said "you so craaazy"
After that she played me,
I asked her who's pussy is this? And she screamed out "Jamie's"

And now that I have put it all out on the line,
Close the deal and wave the hands of time,
Your king, my queen, a wedding ring, for you,
Girl I wanna be with you,

[Chorus]
Any time any place can I be with you
Don't ya know, there's some things I, just wanna be with you
Girl I'm still you man, Girl I'm still your man
sex so good you cant believe it,
later on we can have some kids, thats what it is, Whoa
Can I be with you?

[Hook + Chorus]
Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze,
pop bottles on the regular,
I toast the good smoke, meet your kin folks,
and try to get next to ya,
Good life the lime light, Head down south,
and get ya mind right,
sex so good you cant believe it,
later on we can have some kids, thats what it is, Whoa

Any time any place,
Don't ya know, there's some things hey
Girl I'm still you man, Girl I'm still your man
