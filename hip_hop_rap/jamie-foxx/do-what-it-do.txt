[Intro:]
You know what, I'm ma make it do what it do baby,
I'm ma make it do what it do baby

[Verse I:]
Now baby I just wanna take U're freak'n clothes off,
Kiss U're body while I take U're freak'n clothes off,
Leave'dem heels on while I take U're clothes off,
Leave'dem lights on, let me see U go off

[Chorus:]
Oo Oo, baby that's my body call'n ya name
Oo Oo, and baby that's ya body do'n the same
So act right, gon show me, back it up, now put it on me, act right, gon show me, back it up, now put

Now what U wanna do, U wanna get high, U wanna get fired up
What U wanna do, U wanna get sexxed, U wanna get tied up,
Get yo rodeo ride up, baby girl lift dem thighs up,
I think U betta wise up, Cuz I'm about 2 rise up-- Repeat

[Verse II:]
Now baby holla at me tell me what U miss'n
I can put in work from every position
From the kitchen table, 2 the bedroom floor

[Chorus:]
Oo Oo, baby that's my body call'n ya name
Oo Oo, and baby that's ya body do'n the same
So act right, gon show me, back it up, put it on me, act right, gon show me, back it up, put it on me

Now what U wanna do, U wanna get high, U wanna get fired up
What U wanna do, U wanna get sexxed, U wanna get tied up,
Get yo rodeo ride up, baby girl lift dem thighs up,
I think U betta wise up, Cuz I'm about 2 rise up-- Repeat

[Bridge:]
U're body, U're body's sho nuff singing baby,
Show me how U use it girl, we gon pop some champagne, Listen to some music,
And once we get our clothes off, wrap U're legs around my shoulders, and it's gon be just like I told ya,
Baby I'm gon work you over

What U wanna do, U wanna get high, U wanna get fired up
What U wanna do, U wanna get sexxed, U wanna get tied up,
Get yo rodeo ride up, baby girl lift dem thighs up,
I think U betta wise up, Cuz I'm about to rise up-- Repeat

Do what it do 2'night [Repeat]
