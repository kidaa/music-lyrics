[Verse 1:]
Walked up in the spot like what, gettin
Love from the ladies and the thugs
Im just, tryna get this party off
So this, can be a night to remember
Ladies lookin so damn fly
About, ten of them caught my eyes
I might, show them the time if their lives
Cuz its, a special party tonight

[Chorus:]
Everybody in my party is VIP
We gone sip champagne for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Lettin people in
Cuz everybody in my party is VIP
We gone shot patron for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Come on to VIP

[Verse 2:]

With  that, juice that makes ya want to hhh
Cuz the, mood is alright in here
Ladies aint been trippin at all
Shes been, promising them draws gone fall
I might, love you right in front of all ya'll
Cuz its, all my party I can do what I want to

[Chorus:]
Everybody in my party is VIP
We gone sip champagne for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Lettin people in
Cuz everybody in my party is VIP
We gone shot patron for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
