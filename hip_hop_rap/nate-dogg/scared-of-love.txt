[Chorus]
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man 
I'm just a man in love

When they asked me
why I dont like love
or why I dont have a lady
maybe its because I know
as soon as I tell her
how I feel about her
as soon as I act like
I love her she's gone

[Chorus]
I'm just a man scared of love
I'm just a man is why I dont have a lady
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

I really was so into you
but you dont know what I'm going through
you say you really care for me
but in love there's no guarantee
so, I think I outta take my time
cuz love aint no friend of mine you see

Dont let me get you too confused
you're the friend I dont want to lose
if I made a choice its you I choose
but my heart's a tad bit through
so, I try to get you off my mind
but a remedy I cannot find for you

[Chorus]
I'm just a man scared of love
I'm just a man is why I dont have a lady
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

I'm never gonna try to find
another I'm just out for mine
I left so many far behind
but traces they'll never find
no, I can cover all my tracks all my tracks
wont be nothing gettin back to you

Now dont think that I'm being rude
because I wont commit to you
and other women want to screw
whats a player supposed to do
so, I'll be slippin on my hat
I wont be bringin nothing back to you

[Chorus x2]
I'm just a man scared of love
I'm just a man thats why I dont have a lady
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
