People where are you going 
People where are you going 

Everybody wants to play the game 
But nobody wants to lose 
I see my people die everyday 
That's why I sing the blues 
Now tell me who wants to roll with me 
Take a look at my world 
I see some problems 
Maybe you can help me solve them 
Turn boys to men 
And make women from girls 
I see my loved ones turning to drugs 
Almost everyday I lose another one 
Where are you going I ask you one and all 
Anyone can answer 
I betcha' they dont know 

People where are you going 
People where are you going 

What if I could save my nation 
What if I could save my friends 
If I had the whole worlds attention 
What if people were really listening 
I would tell them that I'm no good without them 
I would tell them together we can stand 
Another message to brothers, colors bother 
I'd introduce them to the hardest man in town 
Somebody thell me please 

People where are you going 
People where are you going 

Where are you going I ask you one and all 
Anyone can answer 
I betcha' they dont know 

People where are you going 
People where are you going
