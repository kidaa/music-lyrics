[Nate]
I've been lookin' for a girl 
Someone to share my world 
For maybe just a day or two 
You've been actin' so stingy 
I know you wanna' see 
If I can do the things you heard 

[Girl]
Actually I'd rather be out with my girls and weed 
I guess that goes go to show you don't know me boy 
If you really want to creep 
Then talk to me with cheese 
Or just don't even talk at all 

Chorus
She's strange and I like it 
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me 
I got game 
So don't fight it 
All around the world she's just a sexy girl 
Strange

[Nate]
You be actin' like you cool 
Like you don't want to do 
The things I know you want to do 

[Girl]
Are you tryin' to come up 
Or maybe just get fucked 

[Nate]
Whatever girl I'm down like you 

[Girl]
If you wasn't so damn cute 
I wouldn't even shoot 

[Nate]
But yet you choose to shoot me down 
Actually it's time I leave 
You're girl is jockin' me 
I hope she's not another tease 

Listen here I'd like to know 
Why you keep actin' strange 
I got no time to chase a hoe 
But I'd like to know your name 
All I got is game to give 
And it's gonna' be cryin' shame 
If you choose to disregard 
And pass up on this game 

Chorus
She's strange and I like it 
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me 
I got game 
So don't fight it 
All around the world she's just a sexy girl 
Strange
