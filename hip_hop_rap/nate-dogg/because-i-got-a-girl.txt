When the cats, awake
the mice will play
thats what the people say
all I know is doggs play anyways
cuz I play everyday
you do it too dont lie
soon as you're out my site
I seen you creepin by
while I was creepin mine
while I was checkin out
I saw you checkin in
I shoulda knocked you out
but I was with your friend

[x2]
Because I got a girl, dont mean we can't talk
Because I got a girl, dont mean I wont break you off
[x4]
Come On Come on girl let me heed it 
Come on Meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded

Back in the days I used to like bitches
but I tell you nowadays bitches ain't shit
and if you wonder why I say this
I've had a few bitches and bitches think they slick
runnin around, playin all my niggaz
trying to split a brother from his grip
got all these bustaz watchin me
but I tell you right now hoe, I dont slip
I'd like to give a shout out to my favorite girl
but I wont you know why, because she's a trick
and if I give a shout out to a sneaky bitch
I got to give a shout to the nigga she's sneakin with
and all my homeys say

[Chorus x4]
Because I got a girl, dont mean we can't talk
come on girl let me heed it
because I got a girl, dont mean I wont break you off
meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded
[x4]
come on girl let me heed it
meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded

Cuz I have never met a girl
that I love in the whole wide world
