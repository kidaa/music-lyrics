I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

I got love - I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin wit me
They know game - play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin wit me
I got love - I, got, love, for my niggaz on my family tree
I got love - love for the ghetto, down for whatever
If you was down before, you gon' still gon' be down wit me
I got game - I, got, game, cause, the game was given to me
Say my name - say, my, name, cause, ain't nobody tighter than me
Give it up - give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rhymin this beat
I don't know - know nuttin better, chasin my chedder
If you in love with a whore -- you ain't never listened to me

Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Captain save - cap-tain, save, a, hooker cause she hangin on me
She can't hang - she, can't, hang, cause I ain't lookin fo' a wifey
Just in case - just, in, case, I, better take a weapon wit me
And these hoes - keep cover, down for whatever
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street
Run me how  Run, me, how  Cause, haters they be all in the mix
And they know - where, they, go-in, ain't gon' get no better than this
Can't they see Can't, they, see, we, ain't some niggaz they wanna diss
D.P.G. - though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin wit me

Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Platinum chains - plat-inum, chains, is, all you ever see on my neck
Diamond ring - dia-mond, ring, as, long as I can keep every check
All the same - all, the, same, as, long as you don't ever forget
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol wit me
Cap-tain, say, we, bustin to a hell of a beat
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, they base'll knock you off of your feet
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place, from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD

I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
