[Nate Dogg Nancy Fletcher]
Now life for me Life for me
livin on the streets On the streets
used to be, hectic, scandalous Scandalous
The people I meet people I meet
when I'm on these streets On these streets
They can be, crazy, and dangerous And dangerous
When you're broke as you can be
And you're on them streets
You have to be, cunning, homey
Keep your hand Keep your hand
on the Hardest Man Hardest man
Or you may be, a dead man

[Chorus]
Crazy, dangerous [x4]

Craa-azy, dangerous [x4]
