*Intro/Chorus*

Why did my homie have to die, with tears in my eyes 
I came to say goodbye, say goodbye 
repeat 2X 

Just passin through to let you know that I remember the times we shared 
Your mother prayed for us both night and day 
	I guess this is what she feared 
The picture in my room keeps your image sharply in my head 
	All in my head 
I just can't let go of the memories I had; will this madness ever end? 

	*Chorus*

Sometimes I wonder if it's better to be free or be in jail 
Incarceration at this time to me is better than heaven or hell 
I often wonder if you'd still be here if you had won your bet 
	Won your bet 
You most likely soon see me we'll all be a memory 
if we don't change this mess... change it or we gone y'all 

	*Chorus*

Hi, passing you through to let you know 
	Passing you through to let you know 
That I, gonna tell everyone I know 
	Gonna tell everyone I know 
How we, used to send them to the floor 
	Used to send them to the floor 
Have we, have we forgot to mourn 

Ohh, how long, how long, how long will they mourn 
Ohh, how long, how long, how long will they mourn 

	*Chorus 3X*
