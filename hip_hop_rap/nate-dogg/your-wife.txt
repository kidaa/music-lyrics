feat. Dr. Dre

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick
I fucked, that's it

[Verse One: Nate Dogg]
All night long, I had her on her back in my Cadillac bro
You should of heard her moan, same old song
I made her throw her back out when I sent her home
For better or worse she's

[Chrous: Nate Dogg]
Your wife, my bitch
Your love, my trick
Her mouth, my dick
I fucked thats' it
Straight pimp, no shit
Gave me your chips
I drove, your whip
It's true don't trip

[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]
What's my name, my name is Mr. Game
West coast big change Mr. Fame
Bad bitch scooped her up same ole same
Fuckin in the drivers seat while I'm switching lanes
Gettin brains Long Beach, Compton thang
Shit ain't changed thats how we do the damn thang
Draws down nuts platinum, let em' hang
Wife missin 5 a.m., who's to blame
I'm the reason used maginum is in your range
and while she bounced out wit me befor you came
Fuckin lame you be handcuff sluts I banged
I trippin take em' back shit my nuts is drained 
On everything this dick is shootin novocain
Have a bitch waitin bus stop, in the rain
Simple and plain cuz we's be off the chain
Nigga Nate Dogg pimp game please don't explain

[Verse Three: Nate Dogg]
Ring or no ring
A hoe gone be a hoe
While you sleepin
She be creppin out the back door
Comin to met me, at my honey comb
Smokin and drinkin dyin to please me 
While real playas keep playin on

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Playas play on
Keep playin on
Ladies playin on, play on
Keep playin on
Playas play on, play on
Ladies play on, play on
Keep playin on
Your wife, is my bitch
Your love, is my trick

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
