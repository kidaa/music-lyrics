Homey it's rainin
Ten below zero
Kinda cold outside Kinda cold outside
Yes it is cold Kinda cold outside
Tornado, hurricane, and high tide 
And a high tide, and a high high tide
I tell you why homey
Had a homeboy, down with me
or so he said Or so he said, that's what he said
Yes he did homey
But as it turned out
He wasn't down with Nate Dogg No, no
He was down with bread He was down with bread, all for himself
You know what's wrong
You, need to take your bad ass home
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, oh homey
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, mmm

Do you remember home Do you remember home
Has it been that long Has it been that long
since you been gone Since you been gone
Won't you come back home
Seems like it was yesterday Yesterday
when you lost your way When you lost your way
And let your homies hang Let your homies hang
All the while you got paid
Do you respect family
Do you know what that mean
To give everythang and not expect to receive
I gave all I had All I had
It really makes me mad Makes me mad
to think I've been had I've been had
Let's forget about the past
But you know what's wrong
You, need to take your bad ass home
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, oh homey
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, mmm

[Nate Dogg]
I will lift my voice
And forever sing
Music gives me joy
May we always reign
And if I lose my way
May my family place
a foot where I can taste
a bitter sweet embrace
You know what's wrong
You, need to take your bad ass home
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, oh homey
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, mmm
