Just in case you didn't know, I blow I blow 
constantly for dough 
I'm sittin next to my heat my heat 
Fuck peace, as I listen to the beat 

We came to rock your body, ding ding dong 
We came to rock your body, all night long 
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong 
We came to rock your body, all night long 

Way back in the days when the hottest thang was Jherri curls 
When you could always spot a gangsta 
by the way his hair out grew his girl's 
There lived a little boy who wore khakis everyday 
He never would be broke he swore, always to get paid 
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie 
Got them same ol' gangsta ways 
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie 
And I ain't the one to get played 

	[Chorus]
	Who's playin games man I really hope you burn 
	Who's playin games when I'm gonna get my turn 
	Who's playin games I don't wanna be left out 
	Who's playin games you playin
