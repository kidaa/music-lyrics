[Fam]
When I be coolin, man look
I just be coolin
I ain't got nuttin to prove
Or ain't nobody to be foolin, yo
Listen to the words that I be sayin
Cos, when I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin
I say yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Look in here, everybody in the house, havin a ball
Yoooo, I'm over here
Yo Diesel, I'm in the rear
Of the party, la-di-da-di
Catchin the vibe from everybody
Feelin alright again
Rollin with my buds, Double I to the end

Chorus-X4
Hey alright, right, right

[Fam *singing*]
I said you ain't a really down, really down
You ain't down with my crew
You ain't down with my crew
Check it out
I said you ain't a really down, really down
You don't do what we do
You don't do what we do

[Fam]
Isn't it beautiful, lovely, the vibe that I'm feelin
Cos my style is so appealin
Got you jumpin to the ceilin
I'm back, in fact I never went nowhere, my man
This track, is Boogie's and he hand it down to Fam
You don't understand, you could never underhand
The wonder man
Comin from the under land
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
It's a Naughty-Rottin thing goin on tonight
If you wanna join in, everything's alright
I'm quite tight
Tip-top shape for the night
Nothin's gonna stop us now, no way in a right
Right you are
Who's gonna stop a shootin star?
Whose aim is to go far
Like the milage on a car
This is for all o' y'all to enjoy
Every man and woman, every girl and boy
Boy, oh boy

Chorus-X8

[Fam]
Yo, I got eight wheels
I wanna roll
Or might go to the rink
And get my stoll on
K-Boggie is the man behind the scenes that makes you move
Ill Town, Ill Town, ain't got nuttin to prove
Wake up every mornin with my boom box blastin
It's you that I'm askin
";What the hell's been happenin";
What once was a fad
Blew up and goin mad
Bart Simpson, even with it
Dropped a single with his dad
This is dedicated to the Hip Hop artist
Those who rock hardest
They're stuck in regardless
When the radio didn't want to play
What we had to say
Now things have changed
Just like a new day

Chorus-X8
