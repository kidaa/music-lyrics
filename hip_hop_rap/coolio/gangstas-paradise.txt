As i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize nothing's left
Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long that even 
My mama thinks that my minds gone but i ain't never crossed
a man that didn't deserve it. 
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
you better watch how you're talking and where you're walking
or you and your homies might lined the chalked
i really hate the trip but i gotta loc
as they croak i see myself in the pistol smoke 
Fool! i'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
all my knees in the night
saying prayers in the street light..
 chorus 
been spending most of our lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise x2
keep spending most of our lives living in the Gangsta's Paradise x2
Look at the situation, they got me facing
i can,t live a normal life, i was raised by the state
so i gotta be down with the hood team
too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin banger
and my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool! Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
i'm living life, do or die what can i say
I'm twenty-three now , but will i live to see twenty-four
the way things is going i don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
that the ones we hurt are you and me
 chorus 
Power in the money , money in the power
minute after minute, hour after hour
everybodys running but half of them ain't looking
what's going on in the kitchen but I don't know what's cookin'
they say i gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand , how can they reach me? 
i guess they can't , i guess they won't , i guess they front
that's why my life is outta luck fool !
chorus 
tell me why are we so blind to see 
that the ones we hurt are you and me  x2
