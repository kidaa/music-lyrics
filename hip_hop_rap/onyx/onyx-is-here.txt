So back up off the block, blow up the spot

The black reign domain, a plain you never been to
And you know what this is what? Face down on the floor
Give me it all, I got they back against the wall.. {*echoes*}
Chorus 2X
[Sticky Fingaz]
Don't be afraid, you'll only lose your life that way
I'm an endangered species, surprised to live to see today
but if you're readin between the enemy line you'll find I'm insane
Too much strain on the brain, capable to pop a vein
So I'ma do-it do-it do-it do-it do it like this
The Onyx is here, so back up or get dissed
And if you put me to the test, I'll lay you to rest
Bring it right to his chest, put it straight through his vest
Chorus 2.5X
Back, UP!!!  Onyx is here..
