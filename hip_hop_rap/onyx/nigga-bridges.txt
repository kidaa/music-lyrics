[Intro]
They gots to back da fuck up! BACK DA FUCK UP!
Know what I'm sayin? Onyx! It's the Onyx kid! Onyx!
Ah yeah! We gonna do it for all my kids..
[Fredro Starr]
Murder Murder! Who the hell hurt her?!
Young black nigga like me gettin' up, got free
Murder Murder! We never have cheese
We always up there, we run for the bees
The body over there, the body over there
Everywhere I check, body jacked, body everywhere
So well I well I fuck it, two tears in the bucket
Voice spillin' over in a Tommy of a dummy
Statue at you, but don't break my cipher
Smoker, sell 'em most, iller for the filler
But this ya mic, STOP foggin' up my glasses
Guns for fun, but son I hit you like a jealous
BANG! Leather hanger, so get the penis
Sorry for ya stitches, your in-convenience
Or what you wear ---, my name is kinda fucked up
Let the killer in up off the steria, BLUNT IT UP, LOAD IT UP!
Faces couldn't fire when you see the bloody redenade
Aaaah yeah! Time to survive...!
[Chorus]
Nigga Bridges fallin' down, they fallin' down, they fallin' down
Nigga Bridges fallin' down, MUTHAFUCKAZ IS ACTING CRAZY!
[Sonsee]
I catch fix for trips, while Sonny flips
So bitch ass nigga, geeks with L freaks
And she ?, diamonds shinin', pockets boldgeous
So I got in a girl, with pearls around her collar
Sticky start to checking her, my soul she couldn't holler
WE ROLLIN' FOR DOLLARS! Make me set 3 pounds 7
And her man said: ";ONE MOVE YA DEAD!
Dunk out their pockets, as if I had a shovel
Movin' on the double, cause we ain't tryin' to see trouble
Dreaming and sceaming, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Gotta sniff it was if autograph FOR YA WHOLE STAFF!
STICK UP BUT WAIT, LEAVE THE POCKET IT'S OKAY
I HIT AND RUN BEFORE YOU SEE ANOTHER DAY
CAUSE THE U.S.G. IS WHERE I STAY
[Onyx, Fredro Starr]
MURDER MURDER! Ya life's on the line
MURDER MURDER! Here's a bullet for ya mind
MURDER MURDER! I'm out doin' crime
MURDER MURDER! But we never do time
[Big DS]
YOU DIRTY MUTHAFUCKIN' RAT! I CHA-CHA-CHA
Now they got me on the line, too tender WHY?!, cuz I killed the inspector
Rzarection, and equal protection, written, burnin'
THE BITCHES OUT SEXIN'! So damn crazy
Now they got me in confession over salaries WHAT?!
Cause they can't get with me AH HAH!
While tubbin' out, me while on trial
I'm headin' for P now, feel and see now
BLESS MY MIND WHEN I WAS OUT DOIN' CRIME!
That's you locked down, WHENEVER BEEN LOCKED UP!
All the time you get ??? and MUTHAFUCKAZ IS ACTING CRAZY!
[Chorus]
[Sticky Fingaz]
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH THE WRONG NIGGA BROTHER
YOU RATHER FUCK YOUR MOTHER
PLUS BUST A CAP, FOR HER LESBIAN LOVER
Bullets tricky save you later ? Before ya wake up!
Doin' hard, I'm clippin' their head
Rentio, bitch aware used to live in Brooklyn now you rest
In a sementary, it's a full moon, now get a chill in my spot
Face the population with my nigga play the 9
Your blood clot warrior, BUST THE INBUSTA!
Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die
WHY?! ME DO NOT KNOW! See you in a next life, bloody boy!
HAHAHA HAHA HAHA!..
[Chorus] 2x
[Outro]

Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck anything! Fuck ya momma, ya father!
