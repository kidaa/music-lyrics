Aiyyo, young brothers out there

[Sonee Seeza]
Give me the money, give me the money
Here comes Sonee the greaser
Sees the hostages; my conscience keeps tellin me I should just
Hit 'em high, hit 'em low, everywhere I go
There's no coppers, to stop us, the pros, our motto
is stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve
[Fredro Starr]
8 o'clock in the mornin, time to wake up
Another brother gettin paid, and away, it's a stick up
No time to even, take a bath
Strictly cash, tax free quick fast
Grab my Polo, jumped in the Timberland boots
I got Audi, time to get rowdy
Shiftee, low down gritty and grimy
I guess I gotta find my crimey
Sticky Fingaz, yo that's Sticky Fingaz
Jetted to the ave. in a half of a second
He wasn't at the spot, so the stop I was checkin
Met him on the way, tucked away was the weapon
Stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve
[Sticky Fingaz]
Single handed me and Mickey barely took a trip to Linden
Picked up some cheeba and some brew and yo what else?
Screamin ";NOTHING!";
Now we on the East train back and ?? said ";SOMETHING!";
Oops, since I stooped, the 40-deuce get loose
Seen three other troopers and they tried to call a truce
One had a link, the other a goose
You know what we took, and you know what we left
But the third one played a punk he dissed his posse and stepped
With Sticky on the loose, there was nothin he could do
So I pulled out the old tape ducted twenty-two
But that was only petty skills, the Philly ?? Freddie
Stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve
[Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah; hand over the money
Don't get like ";Doc, what's up Doc?";
This is Mugs Bunny and ain't nuttin funny; ha, it's a stick up
Sticky got sticky and tricky with the wallet
But this ain't ";El Segundo";
It's just the four, bad, brothers from the ghetto
Stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve, stick 'n' muve
[Suave/Sonee Seeza]
We had an option after 12 in the city
Man we gonna roll with some ? like Nitti
But first we got trips, because the man got geese
Yo mister I just got robbed; have you seen the police?
Nah, none over here - good, so run all your gear
Rolex watch, rings, the Gucci underwear
You might think I'm sorta out of order 
but I'll rob you for a quarter - say whitey's youse a goner
Youse a goner wanna, call the pork, pig
Ya dig, police, peace!
Stick 'n' muve.. stick 'n' muve.. stick 'n' muve.. stick 'n' muve
[Fredro Starr]
