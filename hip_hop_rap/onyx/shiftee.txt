[Fredro Starr]
IIIIIII got struck by lighting in the thunder
Wildin' in the shit from the tundrum
The Winda!!!!
Help me up, somebodies pullin me under
A scorture, a flame on the brain, this is torture
Terrible, horrible section aborter
Sacrifice the virgin, urbun as splurgin
Split sprice i'm gonna fuck yer like it's hurt yer right
Bombs had got shattered, bullet holes in the paper
Escape the madness, ONYX! the baddest
Souls of a souljah in the streets of survival
If yer plan to buy the blackness
Here's the gun to guide you
Thumble up, crews crumble up under pressure God
It's hard, fuck there won't be two prayin'
Chorus:
Shiftee, low down grity and grimy x5
[Sonne Seeza]
Comin' just bust me, peeled the real shit
Drilled through yer ear drum
Hell Yeah I'm vansum
My equilirium is touched with the US G
Sickness, contaminated with slickness
Filfy, nasty, grungy
Blacks of the reched
I got it the 2nd, Crazy Ness went the septrum
Yeah son, keep 'em on the run
If you wasn't a 2, then you musta been a 1
It's not a been case, we erase
What makes it my fate
You just waste your time and butt so you better it space
Cos if thats the shit, your gettin' really stupid
And you and yer man can't shoot me
Chorus:
Shiftee, low down grity and grimy
Shiftee, shiftee, shiftee, shiftee
[Fredro]
Hey you you nasty ass
Whats up big fella
Hey whatever, whatever shit, the dirty desert dweller
Who said never, all and together
Now I'm gonna show you how the afficial niggas lock it up
Chorus:        
Shiftee, low down grity and grimy X6
[Sticky Fingaz]
One Three, 
I'm gonna rule the fuckin world, and thats my word
I've got the filthiest shit human ears ever heard
And even if yer wash my mouth out with soap
I'll still be that disgusting and despicable
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid
My moms dropped me on my head when I was a kid
But then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So in essence armeggedon somebody's bound to get robbed!
Watch out!  So this could be you, I believe
With a gun to your face, it's better to give than recieve 
I'm more than meets the eye
Energize, make your blood pressure rise
Mad face ain't no disguise!
Chorus: 
Shiftee, low down grity and grimy X4
