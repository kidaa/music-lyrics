[Fredro Starr]
It's the phat funky blunt roller, the rock flipper
Proof I've been right, damn right, the gun gripper
Look, no hands but damn, ooh I got a handle
Vandalistic, sarcastic phat tricks
Aah, ohh yeah, dear dime a dozen
Den discuss 'em when I be bustin with my crews, and crimies
How ya like dat?  Phat da-dat da dah-dah, huh
Rat-a-tat, splatter one, jump in the vat son
Flat as a blue bag of boom for ya buddha benders

So Sonee Seeza, you're next up to bat
Phat-a-tat-tat stay strapped, be so phat!
Chorus
P-H-A-T!  Phat phat..
[Sonee Seeza]
Boy ya best to move over cause we takin the crazy's place
Phat, ready for combat, stacked, with all that tracks
Not a re-run, but it's fatter than ??
I'm rockin the grimy clubs, get blunted with Sasquatch
I'm here to let you know, Onyx won't lack what it takes
I scrape, the scrubs comes off in the bath
Kind of like a diamond; I'm a hard black kid
Move me think you're schemin to get the semen out my 
cock-a-doodle-doo, huh, who ya think ya kiddin?
These four villians kills women, have crews do dealin
Straight up, you had enough?  I'm callin your bluff
Body offender, so surrender, kid you ain't tough
You can get some phatter stuff huh I got it
but first just purchase my joint, you can't be without it
It's P phat H phat a phat T phat
P-H-A-T, P-H-A-T!
P phat H phat a phat T phat

P phat H phat a phat T phat
P-H-A-T, P-H-A-T!
P-H-A-T!  Phat phat..
[Sticky Fingaz]
Every ten years, they unleash phat sound
Well it's time for Sticky Fingaz, God's gift to the underground
For cryin out loud, it's enough you're makin sick and I
wants revenge can I die for my music?
You don't understand, I worship hardcore
They never shoulda let me get my boot in the door
And if you think that's a bluff, then you got me all wrong son
Gettin phat like this is easier said than done
Raise up, rise and shine!
I woke up on wrong side of the bed this time
Now it's time to get phat, 'N' all of DAT!!
The phat rap scripts tips scales go longer than endless trials
 Play my part, stay sharp as darts and nails
AHHH shut the hell up chill and don't hold me back, black
I'm ?? my own freestyle I'm ready to rip the track
Onyx is back, so phat we need slim fast
With the boom, check the boom, check the boom body bash!!
