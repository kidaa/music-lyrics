[Fredro Starr]
We roll a hundred niggas deep and not one of y'all got a gun
I bust one shot, you see a hundred niggas run
So sit on black gortex, before test, we all wore vests
I'm takin all bets, to see who will score next
I burn you like floor sex, you just a small threat
Wit a small set, so forfeit, I rhyme for more checks
Cuz whatever that it takes to make these papes, I'mma walk this
I'm worthless, I'm back to sellin cracks behind the trenches
I'ma hurt this when I work this, I'll beat you fuckin senseless
Deep and other bitches got me swingin at the fences
I bring it down like gravity, wit the getto mentalitee
To rule the oddity, the official nasty on the strategy
[Greg Valentine]
The city never sleeps, so don't sleep on us
I put niggas to rust, when my gun bust and plus
You get rushed, and when the press is on, you just been checked
You had plans on conquerin this, you need to switch up
Get up, nigga you should of got up
Obey my orders, cuz shit like that'll leave you shot up
For real, it's a deadman's party, leave ya body at the door
A loss for lechery, my introduction to the century
And entity, is what I plan to be in the industry
Enemies in my vicinity, get assassinated like the Kennedy
My gats the foolproof remedy
[Sonsee]
It's Sonsee, black and blue, the bad news off the pocket
Look like tacky, attack me, you get splashed
Official nasty backwards, sue, what the fuck is rule, you dumb ass
Trynna put shit on our name, you gonna get numb fast
Rap in the street, to do without ya
While I haul off and snatch four shit out ya
Look and see my image again when you start hemorrhaging
And damn, it's cloggin up, the blood he didn't smell
The masses, disastrous, plenty closed caskets
And asses, when I turn, we burn crews to ashes
Niggas take the simple, so get gassed up and smashed up
That's my word, and come wit that bullshit and that's ya ass
[Chorus 8X]
Getto mentalitee
[J Mega]
I trash niggaz who can't speak what I'm sayin
All City, Mega bomb, I ain't playin
Just slayin emcees, and makin niggas freeze
And all of these lyrics for to squeeze
Niggas please don't test me, just let me be
Wit my City, the Nasty, Official and keepin niggas whippy
To hit me, wit the Valentine, forties and bag the bad shorties
I got drafted, because the fuckin Armee called me
And it's all out war, niggas fall out
For reasons that's now unknown, check this shit
I got the illest, the realest, hard for kids to kill us
Until it's, my turn to fall, I'ma bill this
Brick wall, to keep the crabs out of my sector
Inject the, and now correct the J Mega
[Panama P.I.]
The hell wit rules, I won't leave a scratch to patch
This is war, way worth of a grudge match
Big P.I., low uphold a, a Universal soldier
Chump should of listened when I told ya
I'm ill, like fire moms you will, obtain
Flip bombs and peal, lyrics burn like acid rain
Holdin the gutter, buck wild, for offerin butter
I'mma thug, I used to love the drug rubber
Rugged and raw, pretty cuz I'm hardcore
All Mighty then Thor, always ain't it for a faggot jaw
So hard rocks and fillin flocks, clear the block
My mic's a glock, I keep plenty styles in stock
The way emcees react when I attack
Get me away from him, he's a maniac
[Sticky Fingaz]
It's pure you see, I bring fame
They call me Nigga So Much, startin to think it's my name
Light skinned and a shame, cuz way back in the day
They rapped my grandmother's mother's, when they was in Spain
To help my grandfather, he be misbehaved
But my ancestors was brave, and most of them real
Stronghold brass, forty slain workin in the field
But a hundred years later, I learned about my roots
And how they traded in there white sheets, for badges and blue suits
So I'm takin recruits, and shut the fuck, it's on right
And start a fight, a fight, a nigga and a white
And if a nigga don't win, then we all jump in
[Chorus to fade]
