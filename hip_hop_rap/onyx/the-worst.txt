[Fredro Starr, X-1]

[Killa Sin]

Chorus x2
[Method Man, Sticky Fingaz]

major swingers, heavy hittin, poly your kitten, throw up your mitten
stop bitchin, no slippin, no pot to piss in

yo, sticky fingaz, one of the illest mother fuckers
my moms don't raise no suckers, i slap rappers
turn em in to singers, touch something of mine and you'll have 9 fingers
enough said, let's make whole fuckin town read
and rip their whole crew to a shread
