All my peoples locked up better raze up

Lyrical Assault
Mics outlined in chalk
Gun Talk, homicide in New York
Caught a raw deal, horror Amityville
Hand me the steel, breathe in ya' man to get killed
Put a knife to the love of ya' life,
Put a slug in ya' wife
Blood on ya ice
Mud on my knife
Drug price, chain snatch cocaine crack
Goin they jacks with the gat blow ya brains back
Switchin' lanes and drop vests
Blow the top of the jet
Cock and wet you rocked for death
Driveby's pain in eyes painting black lines
All the way live
Guns in the sky
Move and die
Survivin' niggaz leave you left for death
One in ya head
Runnin from Feds
Drugs under ya bed
Crime kills blast rhyme skills like nine mills
So nigga dead
Cuz I kill so what
Chorus:
Official Naz comin' though betta' raze it up
Where my real thugs at you betta' raze it up
All my villains with the checks you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
Official Naz' comin' through you betta' raze it up
If you don't wanna get wet you betta' raze it up
If you from the projects you betta' raze it up

Fredro Starr
Right NOW, we gonna hit you up with the joints like BOW

Sticky Fingaz
Madman, tear down stages
Ain't nobody dead or alive who could get with me and my rages
Throw my clip in a gat and I'm sick of this yap
And I'm ready to bust a cap
And if you happen 
Ya niggaz will get shot fuck the rap
Get ya ass kicked
Set you up or get you blasted
Closed gasket
I'm the bald headed bastard
Black dust gave me black lungs
I pack guns
Im used to action like dodgin' bullets over crack funds
Reaction!
Blaze the mack 10
Shogun
I could spot the sheisty villains cuz it take one to know one
Remove my mask and reveal myself
Heal Myself,
If I was you I would kill myself
So play dead eyes stay red
Spray lead
I'm way fed and ain't leavin without they head
Son holders they bout to get roughed up what
When you see me all you hear is: gunshot kinda noises
Official Naz Comin through ya betta' raze it up
All my shorties in the spot you betta' raze it up
If you don't wanna get shot you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
