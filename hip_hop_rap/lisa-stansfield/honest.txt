Honest
Honest
I just want to be honest with you
Honestly baby you've got me down on my knees
And honey I'm sorry as sorry can be
You see it got me, my defenses were down
All I'm praying is you'll still want me around
Ooh baby
Chorus:
I wanna be honest with you
You've seen it through
But I've gotta tell you babe
I've done something wrong
I wanna be honest with you 
'Bout putting you through this pain
It was only a sexual thing
So help me baby
'Cos I wanna be honest
I wanna be honest with you
Babe we've gotta stop now and take a look at ourselves
'Cos we took a good thing and ran it down to the ground
Found myself lonely and in need of some love
But if it ain't the real thing
Well it just ain't enough
Ooh baby
Chorus
How much can I say I'm sorry?
What more can I do?
I wanna be with you
Won't you say we'll stay together
Don't you say it's gone
I wanna be with you
So baby please understand
I love you
Chorus
