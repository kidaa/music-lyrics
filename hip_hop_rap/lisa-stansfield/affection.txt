L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
Feel the sun on your face and the wind in you hair
And a big, big love in your heart
So strong
Feel a hand in your hand and a whisper sweet and low
That says I love you
Spoken:
We all know what we want
Chorus:
Affection, it's a way of life
Direction, all of us know which way we're going
With our affection
Affection, may be big or small but know that
We can have it all with our affection
We know which way to go
Take a walk in the sun with the one you love
And a big, big love in your heart
So strong
And rest a little while, keep on smilin', smilin'
Spoken:
We all know what we want
Chorus
Well, you could lay down and die for the one you're lovin'
There's a sweet, sweet love in your heart
So strong
When you're dancin' on the air, like you don't care
It's honey on your lips and sweeter to your fingertips
You know what we want
Chorus
