L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
We've got it together darlin', we're ready for it
You see I'm smilin'
Hmm we've got the people talkin', they know how we feel
And it's no big deal
And we're not playin' games and we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that
Hear what I'm sayin' boy, let go and be my joy
I have to love you
Chorus:
You can't deny it baby, we drive each other crazy
You can't deny it, no two people ever felt this way
You can't deny it baby, we drive each other crazy
We've just got to let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out
The more we're with each other, it's so exciting
And it's getting stronger
The way you touch me darlin', I've never been
Touched like that before
And we're not playin' games and we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that
You're all I need my love, you're there to push me on
I have to love you
Chorus
We can shout let it out
We can shout let it out
We can shout let it out
We can shout let it out
And we're not playin' games and we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that
Hear what I'm sayin' boy, let go and be my joy
I have to love you
Chorus
