L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
Spoken:
There will never be another love for you and me
Chorus:
Real love where do you come from
Real love lead the way
Real love where do you come from
Real love stay with me
Stay with me
I need you baby like the birds need to sing
I want you always, I cherish everything
You do for me, babe you set me free
It's you and me, for eternity
Chorus
When your arms surround me
And you smother me in your sweet love
We let tender kisses loose on one another
We're not living in the shadow of someone we could be
There's no pretending, when we're together all there is
Is honesty, babe you set me free
It's you and me, for eternity
Chorus
I need you baby and I know you need me too
We were meant to be together
There's something special in the
Things that we do, it's me and you
We're stuck like glue, 'cos this love is true
Chorus
