F. Fisher/D. Fisher 
Chorus
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
'Cause I'm pleading neutrality
Got my gun, now can't you see
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
Blitzkrieg baby, you look so cute
All dressed up in your parachute
Let that propaganda be
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
Bridge
I'll give you warnin', 'cause I'm afraid I'll have to raid
So take my warnin', or else you'll get this hand grenade
Chorus 2
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
Better save up your TNT
I don't want no infantry
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
Blitzkrieg baby, blitzkrieg baby, blitzkrieg baby
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
Chorus
Bridge
Chorus 2
Blitzkrieg baby, blitzkrieg baby, blitzkrieg baby
Blitzkrieg baby, you can't bomb me
