J. Mtume/R. Lucas 
Sure you do
You know how to make it right
So nice
You know how to love me
There's no denying
Sweet as morning light
Sooner or later
I knew you'd come my way
You're welcome to my love
Just promise that you'll stay
Chorus:
You know how to love me...Right
In a special way
You know how to love me...Tonight
And I wanna say
You know how to love me
You're the real that I feel never go away
Seeing's believin'
Don't you know you're a dream come true
Ain't nothin' deceivin''bout the way that I'm lovin' you
You know how to love me You know, you know
You know how to make it right
I can feel it
You know how to love me
No doubt about it
Sweet as morning light
Nothing's forever
That's what people say
But each time that we're together
Forever and a day
Chorus
