L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
Just the way you walked, walked into my life
Then you walked right out, you were as cold as ice
How could you be mean, to treat me so unkind
Now I'm on my own, in a cold and lonely life
Chorus:
Wake up baby
Can't you see I'm half insane
Wake up baby
'Cause you know I'm not to blame
You know you're crazy to throw it all away
So won't you wake up baby
Baby
Take the time to look, look into my eyes
Then you'll see this girl will always love you right
She will always try to give you what you need
So askin' you, I'm beggin' and I'm pleadin' with you
Chorus
Rap:
Can't you see you're just killin' me
I'm on my own and I'm all alone
Don't cha know that you're not at home
I can't sleep at night I get so uptight
Whatcha been is bad to me
If you had heart boy, you'd be smarter
Lied, cheated and mistreated
Listen baby, you're out of order
