L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/R. Darbyshire/N. Mead 
Look at all the things we've been through
Look at all that we did, and we promised to do
There was me, there was you
Two years to blue
I still feel that magic from this
I still feel that spark
With your touch, with your kiss
So such bliss, and then this
Two years to blue
But now we've got eternity and we can't go wrong
Baby, we can do as we please
'Cause our electricity could light up this city, baby
We'll charm the birds from the trees
Look at all of the things we've been through
Now let's do everything that we promised to do
Still there's me, still there's you
It's brand new after two years too blue
Two years too blue x2
Much too much, too much, too much x2
Too blue x2
You're here baby, I'm here baby x2
After two years too blue.
