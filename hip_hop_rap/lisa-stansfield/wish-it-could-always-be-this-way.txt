L. Stansfield/I. Devaney 
Into the sunrise
You're still lying by my side
Baby there's no need to touch me
'Cos I can feel your eyes
They're burning through me burning through me
Warmer than the morning light
Ooh the closer you get
The faster my heart beats
Don't stop yet
'Cos there's lots more we can see
We'll be makin' love makin' love
While the sun shines
I have spent my whole life long just trying to find you
Now I'm not gonna let it slip away
Chorus:
Wish it could always be this way
To always cherish the love we make
Because if life is what we make it 
Then let's make it
Always be this way
You're my darling
and you'll always be 
My mm mm mm
My everything
We'll be makin' love makin' love
I have spent my whole life long just waiting to find you 
Now I'm not gonna let it slip away
Chorus
I have spent my whole life long just waiting to find you 
Now I'm not gonna let it slip away
