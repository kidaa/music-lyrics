S. Oliver/J. Young 
When I was a kid, about half past three
My ma said daughter, come here to me
Says, things may come and things may go
But this is one thing you ought to know
Chorus1
Ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it x3
That's what gets results
Ain't what you do, it's time that you do it x3
That's what gets results
You can try hard, don't mean a thing
Take it easy, easy, in the jive'n swing
Ain't what you do, it's the place that you do it
Aint what you do, it's the time that you do it
Ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it
That's what gets results
You've learned your ABCs, you've learned your DFGs
But this is something you don't learn in school
So get your hip boots on, and then you carry on
But remember not to try too hard or it don't mean a thing
Chorus
Ain't what you do, it's the time you do it 2x
Ain't what you sing it's the way that you sing it
That's what gets results 2x
