T. Brock 
I suppose you take me boy for somebody's fool,
By the way you treat me boy one day you're gonna lose,
Oh, in and out of my life each day, having everything your way,
But now there's something I've got to say...
Chorus:
You've got a case of too much love makin'
I'm giving' all and you're just takin'
I'm in love with you, but that just won't do
You've got a case of too much love makin'
I'm givin' all and you're just takin'
I'm in love with you, but that just won't do.
You don't know it boy but you're hangin' from a limb,
And the odds that you won't fall are gettin' mighty slim,
I don't know what's on your mind, or if you're just killin' time,
I've got to have a love that's for real and mine all mine, oh
Chorus
I don't know what's on your mind, or if you're just killin' time,
I've got to have a love that's for real and mine all mine, oh
Chorus
