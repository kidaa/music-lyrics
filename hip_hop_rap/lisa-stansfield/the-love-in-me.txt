L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
I ain't puttin' you in no cage
I ain't puttin' no chains on you, baby
The love in Me
If you believe in love then you'll believe in me
'Cause I'm everythin' you want
And baby, I'm everything you need
I know where you're coming from
'Cause I'm a woman
I'm freer than the breeze
And fresher than the air that you breath
Ohhh, my heart is breakin'
Ohhh, when it's tired and achin' for love
I'll give you more
Chorus:
It's the love in me, has to be, all that you need
A love that less, can't possess
All that I have to set you free
The love in me
You'll always be free 
To come and go as you please
'Cause baby I know you'll 
Always want to come back to me
Behind every good man there lies a woman
And incidentally, I'm the woman you need
Ohhh, my heart is breakin' 
Ohhh, when it's tired and achin' for love
I'll give you more
Chorus x 2
I ain't puttin' no chains on you, baby
I ain't puttin' no chains on you
Ohhh, when your heart is breakin' 
Ohhh, when it's tired and achin' for love
I'll give you more
Darlin'
Chorus
