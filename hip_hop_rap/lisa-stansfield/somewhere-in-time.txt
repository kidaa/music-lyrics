L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/R. Darbyshire 
Somewhere in time I will swear you'll be mine
And I'll love you
Love you true
If you won't I won't tell
Even though we've been through hell
In my heart I will love you forever baby
But we know it just can't be now
So baby farewell
This thing it bigger than both of us
And baby believe it because...
Chorus:
Somewhere in time I will swear you'll be mine
And I'll love you, ooh ooh
Somewhere in time there's no reason no rhyme
But I'll love you, ooh ooh
Baby there's no way of knowing
But baby your feelings are showing
Somewhere in time I will swear you'll be mine
Cos' I love you
Love you true
It's right that they don't know
And it's only right, only right that I should go
But if you'll wait I'll wait too
I'll wait all my life
All my life and more for you
This thing is bigger than both of us
And baby believe it because...
Somewhere in time I will swear you'll be mine
Cos' I love you
Love you true
There will be better days
But for now let's just say good-bye
So hold on to me just one last time
Hold on to me and baby, baby
You've got to believe
Chorus x 2
Baby there's no way of knowing
But baby your feelings are showing
Somewhere in time I will swear you'll be mine
Cos' I love you
love you true
