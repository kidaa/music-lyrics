L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
Mighty love, Mighty love
Spoken:
It's once in a lifetime, and this time, it's mine
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
'Cause I'm always gonna love you
There's so much you haven't seen that I can show you
But I never wanna shove you
Maybe ladies come and maybe ladies go 
But I'll tell you this lady's stayin'
And if you don't want to rush it we can take it slow
Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is
Chorus:
A mighty love, a mighty love
No push or shove, we're all dreamin' of
A mighty love, a mighty love
It's what we want, and there can never be no other love
I swear I'll never have you ride in back, in tow
I swear I'll never hurt you
Darlin' I could never be with anyone else
'Cause you're all I need to know
And I won't ever let you go
Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, this is
Chorus
No one will ever know
Maybe ladies come and maybe ladies go 
But I'll tell you this lady's stayin'
And if you don't want to rush it we can take it slow
Baby it's a special thing, and there's no reason to explain
This is what so many long for, it's
Chorus
