L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/R. Darbyshire 
The very thought of you
The very mention of your name
Babe I'm caught on you
I just wish you felt the same
'Cos baby I hope and I pray you'll beg me to stay tonight
'Cos the very thought of you is keeping me alive
Chorus:
The very thought of you, it sees me through it keeps me going
Babe I'm caught on you, you're all I see and all I know
Can't you see just what you're doing to me baby
The very thought of you's enough to drive me crazy
And the very thought of you is keeping me alive
Every Monday I see you
I can't wait for you walking by
I'm obsessed and I need you
I'm going out of my mind
I can't rest 'till you're near me
No I can't wait 'till I see that smile
I'm in a mess and I mean it
I'm going out of my mind
And babe I hope and I pray you'll beg me to stay tonight
I won't give up the fight 'cos I need your loving
Chorus
We used to be lovers
Now all we are is the best of friends
It's not enough just to talk to you
I wanna hold you again
And baby I hope and I pray you'll beg me to stay tonight
I won't give up the fight 'cos I need your loving
Chorus
Can't you see just what you're doing to me baby
The very thought of you's enough to drive me crazy
And the very thought of you is keeping me alive
Chorus
