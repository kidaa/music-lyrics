M. Black/J. More/L. Stansfield

Everybody's looking for a meaning
Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving the problem
Ain't nobody helping each other
Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future
And some of us wonder
Givin' into life, givin' into love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Givin' into hope, and into trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Chorus:
People hold on
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on
We've got to be strong
People hold on
Everybody's getting frustrated
Why should we live with this hatered
We've all dancin' on a thin line
They're makin' out we're having a good time
So who's gonna give us the answer
Sister and brother
Givin' into life, givin' into love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Chorus
People hold on, people hold on to it
you know you gotta do it
Givin' into life, givin' into love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Givin' into hope, and into trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Chorus
