L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/R. Darbyshire 
Chorus
Why do we call it love baby, why do we call it love
Love is something that is sent from heaven up above
Why do we call it love baby, what were we thinking of
I feel it shakin' in my bones, and I'm feelin' awful rough
Bridge
If sugar is sweet, then there's too much in my tea
And I'm sick to my stomach when you creep up on me
Every time that we ooh, every time we kiss and hug
My insides do the jitterbug, why do we call it love
Why do we call it love
Chorus
Bridge
Why do we call it, why do we call it love
Why do we call it, why do we call it, why do we call it love
Bridge
Why do we call it love 5x
