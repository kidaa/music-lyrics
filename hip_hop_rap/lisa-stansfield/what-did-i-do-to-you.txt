L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
It's the way you walk, and the way you talk
Now you're nothing near the way that you were
And there's something strange when you hold my hand
Tell my why you changed the way that we were
Tell my why you changed the way that we were
Could we be the same, could we try again
Chorus:
What did I do to you, baby?
What did I do to you, baby?
What did I do to you, what did I do to you?
What did I do to you, baby?
You never touch my skin, in the way you did
And you even changed the way you kiss me
When lovers part there's a change of heart
But my heart can't change the way that we were
Oh no, my heart can't change the way that we were
Could we be the same, could we try again
Chorus
Togetherness is when I undress 
Never when we talk, never tenderness
And I can't forget all the joy we had
But I know we'll be the way we were
Yes, I know we'll be the way we were
Could we be the same, could we try again
Chorus
Help me back
