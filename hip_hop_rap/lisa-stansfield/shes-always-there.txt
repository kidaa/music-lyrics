L. Stansfield/I. Devaney 
She feels such pain when you say goodbye
Nearly goes insane
When you can't look her in the eye
And it's plain to see
That she's being used
But she's always there and she love you
Rest up here a little while
And I'll convince you that you need my time
Don't play games with aching hearts
Shhh not another word
Let me talk
I've been close I've been watching you
Watching every little thing you do
Don't you realize you're breaking hearts
Shhh not another word
Chorus:
She feels such pain when you say goodbye
Nearly goes insane
When you can't look her in the eye
And it's plain to see
That she's being used
But she's always there and she loves you
And she cries
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
How can you go through life this way
Causing hurt causing pain
Think of your baby and not about yourself
Shhh not another word now
Chorus
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Don't play games with aching hearts
Shhh not another word
Chorus
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
