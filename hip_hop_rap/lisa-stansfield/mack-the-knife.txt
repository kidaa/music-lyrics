Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jack knife has MacHeath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears MacHeath, dear
So there's not a trace of red
On the sidewalk, Sunday morning
Lies a body oozing life
Someone's sneaking round the corner
I'll bet that someone, someone's Mack the knife
From a tug boat by the river
A cement bag's dropping down
The cement's just, just for the weight, dear
Bet you, I'll bet you Mack is back in town
Louie Miller, he disappeared, dear
After drawing out his cash
And MacHeath spends like a sailor
Did the boy, did the boy do something rash?
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver
Polly Peachum, and Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, dear
Now that Macky's back in town x2
