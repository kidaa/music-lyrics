L. Stansfield/I. Devaney 
You used to always say it
Honey we can make it 
We've got such a love
So sweet and pure
But now you seem to feel
The love we have can't take no more
How can you be so sure
I have to close my eyes to hold back the tears
I beg you baby please
Chorus:
Never wanna say goodbye
Goodbye to you
Find though there's not a thing I can do
I never wanna say goodbye
goodbye to you
It used to feel like heaven
But now it feels feels hell
'Cos you're closing the door
On love
Now it feels so cold
'Cos baby when you hold me close
it's not there anymore
I have to close my eyes to hold back the tears
I beg you baby please
Chorus
I have to close my eyes to hold back the tears
Just can't believe that you don't want me here
Don't let me go now
I'm down on my knees 
I beg you baby please
