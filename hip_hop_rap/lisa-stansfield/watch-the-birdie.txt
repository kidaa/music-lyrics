D. Raye/G. Paul 
Chorus
Watch the birdie and take a camera candid shot
Watch the birdie, come on and give it all you got
Watch the birdie, just look around and pick a spot And hold it 
Chorus 2
Watch the birdie, just strike a funny pose a while
Watch the birdie and you can beat that pose a mile
Watch the birdie, let me see your pretty smile And hold it

Looking for a tall dark handsome man
With eyes of blue and golden tan
Strong white teeth like Joel McCrea
Hey you, get out of the way
