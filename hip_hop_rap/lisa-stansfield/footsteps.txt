Don't give up, you're not alone
Though you're weak and chilled to the bone
I will shore the pain that you're going through 
If there's one set of footsteps I'll be carrying you
If there's one
One set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
If there's one
One set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
If you're losing faith, I'll understand
Don't be afraid I'm holding your hand
If you trust in me then I will be true
If there's one set of footsteps I'll be carrying you
If there's one
One set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
If there's one
One set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
Then I'm gonna walk on, walk on
I'm gonna walk on 'till the hurt is gone
Walk on, walk on
I'm gonna keep going, gonna carry on
Walk on, walk on
I'm gonna walk on
I'm gonna walk on
Don't give up, you're not alone
Gotta try to be strong, you've got to move on
Just hold on tight and you'll make it through
If there's one set of footsteps I'll be carrying you
If there's one
One set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
If there's one
One set of footsteps in the sand
One set of footsteps
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on
I'm gonna walk on 'till it's gone
