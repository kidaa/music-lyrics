L. Stansfield/I. Devaney

Spoken:
Sometimes people make mistakes
They play the game, play hard to get
Then it all goes wrong and they end up being lonely
I'm one of those people
Got me missing you
You've got me missing you
At the time it seemed OK
Nothing too serious I said
Just two people having fun
Or so I thought
At the time I was playing it cool
I had it all under control
But then I broke the golden rule
I went and said you'd never have me
But baby you've got me...
Chorus:
Missing you
Every day every night
You've got me missing you
Without you this ain't a life
Got me missing you
And baby try as I might
just can't stop this pain inside
If I could do it all again
I'd say the things I truly meant
'Cos now you're gone I've gone insane
Funny how I always said you'd never have me
But baby you've got me...
Chorus
I stay up late at night 'cos
I've been sleeping light
I've made a full-time job of going out of my mind
Can't see one good reason
I should live my life without you
Without you
Chorus
