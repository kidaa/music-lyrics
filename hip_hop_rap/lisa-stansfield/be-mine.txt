L. Stansfield/I. Devaney 
My sweet joy.
It's the little things you do that make me love you,
The way you touch my hair,
The way you care,
And when night-time comes around,
I fall asleep with you,
So I can dream the day all over again.
With sweet sweet love runnin' through me,
I give you everything I have and everything I can be,
I can't stand the thought of ever losing you,
So baby stay with me.
Chorus:
May you always be mine,
Babe I want you for all time,
May you always be mine
From the moment you take hold of me,
I wake up,
You wake up my very soul,
Time just flies away the more you kiss me,
May we forever share this love affair.
Chorus
Babe I can't explain that it's like walking in the rain,
And I thank God for the day I found you,
We've got the lot with the love we've got,
So let it stay...
Chorus
