G. Gershwin/I. Gershwin 
It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for one year, but forever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies, but in time they grow
Chorus
But oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Not for one year but forever and a day
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibralter may tumble, they're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Chorus
But our love is here
Our love is here
Our love is here to stay
