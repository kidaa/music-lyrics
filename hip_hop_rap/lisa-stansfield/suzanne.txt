L. Stansfield/I. Devaney 
With lips inviting me to kiss them
You stare me straight in the hips
It's all so simple it excites me
I stand and wait for your fingertips
You run your fingers through my hair
I feel the sweat on my back
There's something everybody dreams of
My dream is in your hands
Chorus:
The kiss is sweeter when it's under the sugar tree
Sweet and dripping with with deceit, yeah, the sugar tree
We move in closer to each other
I start to sway from the heat
I want this feeling of excitement
To lay me under the sugar tree
This is my honeysuckle dream
That lets me be who I want to be
Give me the best of your attention
And let me see what I wannna be
Chorus
Tonight you're everything to me
and I don't care what tomorrow may bring
Because I'm lying in yoour arms and the smell is so sweet
Let me be wild, let me free
This is my honeysuckle dream
That lets me be who I want to be
Give me the best of your attention
And let me see what I wannna be
Chorus and fade
