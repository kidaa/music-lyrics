L. Stansfield/I.Devaney/A. Morris 
Should I reveal what I'm feeling
Should I look into your eyes
Or should I just grab you and pull you to me
Should I should I should I
Do I pretend I don't notice
When really I'm shaking inside
Do I believe you're the only one
Do I do I do I
Chorus:
You turn me on
You turn me on baby
You turn me on
Do I do I do I
Oohooh yeah
Oohooh yeah
I feel every nerve in my body
Getting sensitive
Come on my darling and make me sweat
'Cos I 'cos I 'cos I want you to
Chorus
Should I take hold of your body
And touch you the way that I want
Should I make sweet sweet sweet love to you
Should I should I should I
You turn me on
You turn me on baby
You turn me on
Do I do I do I
