B. Holland/L. Dozier/E. Holland 
Baby, I need your lovin', I need your lovin'
Although you're never here, your voice I often hear
Another day, another night, I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
Chorus
Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness for someone to have to beg
Then weak I'd rather be, if it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Chorus x 2
Every night, I call your name
Sometimes I wonder, will it ever be the same
Darlin' I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me darlin'
Makes me feel half alive
Chorus x 2
Baby
