S. Colman/C. Leigh 
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till that warmup's underway, wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day, you ain't seen nothin' yet
Chorus
The best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day that you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait 'till your charms are ripe for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but honey, you ain't left the ground
Wait 'till you're locked in my embrace, wait 'till I draw you near
Wait 'till you see that sunshine place, ain't nothin' like it here
Chorus
Come the day your mine
And you're gonna be mine
