L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/A. Morris 
All my life I keep on searching for that special thing
How I've tried to always find a love and understanding
To always see the light of day and to know that I am living
All my life I won't take if I'm not giving
Only when the rain comes down
Only when the lightning strikes me
Will I find the answer for myself
Chorus:
It's got to be real
Be the best nothing less than wonderful
It's got to be real this time
What's waiting there inside
It's got to be real
Knowing love know it can be powerful
It's got to be really love
So we can rise above
All my life I try to see the love inside myself
And I keep on trying in no uncertain terms
To let my light shine through
Only when the rain comes down
Only when the lightning strikes me
Will I find the answer for myself
Chorus
To always see the light of day and to know that I am living
All my life I won't take if I'm not giving
Only when the rain comes down
Only when the lightning strikes me
Will I find the answer for myself
Chorus
