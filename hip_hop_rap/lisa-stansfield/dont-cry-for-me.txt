L. Stansfield/I. Devaney/M.C. Rooney/M. Morales

The birds don't sing the same any more
They always sounded happy before
But now there's something missing
'Cos they don't see me kissing you no more
My sky has fallen down through the floor
I go to sleep with no-one to hold
In bed when you were near me
I didn't really feel the cold at all
Chorus:
I'm picking up the pieces now
Know I'm gonna get through somehow so
Don't cry for me
I've gotta make it on my own
Learn to be alone
Ooh baby
Don't cry for me
I feel like there's a hole in my heart
I've gotta fill it up and make a new start
I can't sit here forever
Although it seems I'll never ever get that far
I'm gonna get outside and make some new friends
And put me back together again
It's no use feeling lonely
When I know I'm not the only one who feels like this
Chorus
It's hard baby it's hard
But I'm trying
Trying my best to make it through
I know deep in my heart when I'm crying
I'm trying to forgive you
The birds don't sing the same any more
They always sounded happy before
But now there's something missing
'Cos they don't see me kissing you no more
Chorus
