L. Stansfield/I. Devaney 
Babe I'm ashamed
Didn't mean to cause you pain
And I hurt too for hurting you
And I won't let you go
And I don't wanna say goodbye
And I didn't mean the things I said last night 
I flew off the handle
And had too much wine
And I'm sorry for the hurt I've caused you
Chorus:
Never set me free
Don't wanna know just how sad I can be
Never set me free
'Cos baby that's the last thing
That I wanna be
I apologize
Can you forgive me the lies
'Cos I want so to let you know
That I won't let you go
And I don't wanna say goodbye
And I didn't mean the things I said last night 
And by tomorrow
I still wanna be with you
Be with you forever more
Chorus
I don't wanna be without you
Let's stay sweet
I don't wanna be without you
Just keep me with you
baby
Never let go 'cos I know there's more
Can you forgive me
Never set me free
Don't wanna know how loveless life can be
Never set me free
'Cos baby that's the last thing
That I wanna be
