[Talking]
Verse:1 B.G.
I been in this game for awhile I'm a paid man now huh bruh
On my sixth solo album I'm a made man now yep
Six years strong in this game
Been doing my thang respect
Eighteen
Livin' a millionaire dream dream
All my niggas worth ten Gs off top
Twenty on my rolex five on my pinky ring
In my younger day I was facin' penitentiary fa sho
I was packin' 22s back in elementary i saved ya
I done been through it all
A muthafuckin' juvenile I can go through fall off top
Hookin' up with my partnas takin' niggas to war huh bruh
Gettin' street drivers and poppin' up a nigga car car
Before the school bell ring I was smokin' a gar gar
Runnin' to my mama residence off the set set
Snatchin' bundles of rock is something that I regret no mo
But I done shaked that life cuz B.G. got plans off top
From being a wise guy to becoming a made man
Chorus  4x
I got the right to hold a K up in my hand
Cuz I'm a muthafuckin' muthafuckin' made man nigga
Verse:2 Baby
Nigga I'm a made man gold mouth dog what
Tattooed and scarred up playboy my neck and wrist fog say dat
But these white folks tryin' ta bust a nigga balls fuck dem
Tru to life game spittin' since 96 boy alright
Now I'm out cha with my homies and I'm actin' a hog actin'
Tru to what I seek tryin' ta live my songs fall livin'
Nigga outta line puttin' ten on his feet
Muthafuckas creep
Nigga want war lets take it to the street
Me and my lil b.g. tag teamin' in 93
I keep it real with my family and my fuckin' peeps fuckin' right
Nigga disrespect lets put the nigga to sleep put'em ta sleep
I'm discreet about the things that I do on the streets
Them niggas be sayin' baby put that fuckin' boy to sleep baby done that?
Them niggas be sayin' baby put that change on his feet baby done that?
I got these niggas sayin' that boy babys a crook a crook?
I got these hoes sayin' that boy baby off the hook he off the hook
Lockin' down the whole project 
For self-respect lock it down
And them police be sayin I know he on paper he got a tech aint that cold
Nigga i'm a muthafuckin' made man
Fuck with my lil B.G.s and nigga you a dead man
Helicopters and choppers is what I save man
I'm a paid man
'Til I'm a dead man
Nigga I'm a muthafuckin' made man
I'm mutha made man
Chorus 4x
Verse:3 B.G.
I'm on a level where I ride on dubbs now on dubbs
I'm on a level old timers give me love now love
I walk the street nigga respect the B.G. fa shizzi
Because I made it I'm a major part of CMB off top
Baby gave me the game at a young age
Handle yo businees bust a head if you feel played fa shizzi
And best believe I done took some niggas off the shelf
God forgive me I got a graveyard under my belt forgive me lawd
I done walked in the killer shoes 
The drug dealer shoes
Done bad masked up and gave niggas blues
I been in the game for awhile I done graduated
I feel deep down in my heart I can't be faded
You don't know what I done been through
To get to not at all
Where I'm at now cross me I'll flip you fa sho
I'm doin' hella good but I done done bad millionaire dream
I'm glad to say that i'm a made man off top nigga
Chorus 4x
