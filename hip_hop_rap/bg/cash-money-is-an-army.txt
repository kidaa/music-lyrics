Shit's just to real, respect my mind 
I'm tell'n you what's real, I'm a come like this
Verse 1:
Money making is my thing, Cause I'm try'n to be rich
Try'n to put a way Mil million that's why I'm in ths studio on my shit
droppin rap after rap like we sell Key after Key
backed up by the best Fresh Mannie Fresh Drop it beat after beat
My click is the HotBoy$ best believe we so Hot!
And dangerous if we in to deep will clear the whole block
No fake nuts at all nigga we roll to deep
With AK's off safety knockin niggaz off their feet
I go by the name the B.G., I ride on chrome in the 98 Lex E-S-3
I bust a nigga dome for Baby, known as B-3, and all these niggaz
Know my dog a do the same for me, we family
Cash Money Is A Army Nigga

I know I'm tired of these bitches try'n to get me killed 
I know I'm tired of these stankin hoes smileing in my grill
Shit Just to real and I'm in a battlefield try'n to get my Mil
It ain't no secret I got skills to pay the bills, I'm climbing up

I drop my nuts of in a situation any day cause on the real B.G.

Chorus x2:
My stumping ground is the Mutha Phuckin U.P.T Uptown New Orleans
If you want me I can be found on V.L. Valence Street in the 13th 
Rest In Peace, My heart goes out to my round L.T.
A slim nigga with two at the bottom, four cross the T-O-P
A H.B., HotBoy a trill nigga, a hard up rider, lay low and be cool
I'll meet your on the other side I been thinking bout you day & night
With out you on my all night flight it don't get right but you know

Chorus x2:
Cash Money Is A Army Nigga
A Navy Nigga
