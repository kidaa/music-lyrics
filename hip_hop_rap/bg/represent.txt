Verse 1: BulletProof
I'm full of that raw
???? a cop cho choo chop
I live and die 17 shots without a glock
Bought downtown
When I hit your spot I'm tearin it down
Chopper City be coming playing with over a hundred rounds
SK's, AK's, 10 and 4's, G's and Mac's
All you can do is put it on your fuckin back
Call ???? pronunciation might sell ounce that dope
I see nothing but cars Eclipse and Camaroes
Times are hard to explore I made my own fort
Fifteen hundred pearl white ain't that a bitch?
Doing this uptown behind a tint
Nigga chopper
Better watcha
You slip we gotcha
They say the richest nigga in the click slip they lose
Hang it up your on the news
Partner sings the blues
Can't be no baller if your a hoe tryin to slang yah-yo
Smart tymer thought I'm the one tryin to see their neck broke
Flip by Calliope
Fo-fo's
Hurrah my fo-fo's
My niggaz in public run in the store bank froze
