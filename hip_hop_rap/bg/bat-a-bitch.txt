always have these hoes in line, never whine or dine 
break them off nine, kick them in they fucking behind
its necessary to pimp, gotta mac on these hoes
don't be paying for these hoes, put that bozack on these hoes

bust a nut and I'm up I'm the type that fucking duck
you see the push come to rub

these hoes out for jingles so you can't show no love
pimping ain't easy but you do it cause you gotta
knock her and chia pop her, ignore her nigga drop her
i know my dick got power, leave a pussy sour
pump it hour after hour, stank bitches gone shower 
I see bitches handeling niggas, hoe try to be hard
nigga don't let them pull your card, if they down be saw
i leave a pussy hole cheezy, greasy

Chorus2x
Pimpin' ain't easy, gotta keep these hoes from talking back
Hoe I'm your daddy respect it or get batted 
Ain't nothin' but a G thang baby 
these stank ass hoes going crazy
Baby
I'm so down but still hard on these stank hoes 
what the pimp of C.M.R do to them be so cold 
i'm still taxing these wanna be bitch niggas

B.G.
These hoes like mosquitoes, sucking dick and lickin nuts
ridin these '96 blue trucks 
Baby
You want a pound of coke come with a hundred g's
half of pound of coke, selling them for 50 g's

and we front you niggas right before the ???
B.G.
Whole keys, half keys for 10 5
Four in a half for 16 25
Baby 
I'm straight fronting my coke nigga uptown
no disrespect I don't sell to niggas downtown
stick where I'm from thats where I be
so I can see my muthafuckin money on the streets
we're the baddest bitches in this fucking city
B.G.
One short, one tall, and one a dog
Baby
But see that dog bitch nigga she gone catch hell
but she gone trick, suck dick and stack mail
I beat a bitch like Ike every chance I get
I beat a nigga like Joe beat Mike at ???
And I'm gone rep and stunt till I just can't quit
and I'm gone keep my diamonds to blind a bitch
B.G.
I wanna see all my homies get on they feet

Mannie Fresh
Cash Money in the power, you bitches in the Eddy Bouwer
a whole city of niggas that follow, the thangs I do, 
the way I walk, the way I talk, the shit I buy, the shit I bought
see I gets more pussy than cotex, I sport rolex,
purchase with bad checks
just to get with me, sit with me 
get a pit for me, bitch you ain't shit to me
cause I done gave more dick that a calio got bricks
she used to be your hoe but thats my bitch
that hoe calls me realist, nigga you one of the realist
Ding dong, daddys home, to the break of dawn, lets get it on
so you can feel it, dick down your spine, I don't mine
takin it off, breaking it off, shakin it off, doing it again
stickin it in, bringin a friend, cause these niggas be laggin
about the bitches they pimpin straight braggin
but if your dog was preganent and all you couldn't be taggin
the bitches I fuck, the bitches I duck, 
ask that hoe next to you, that bitch know my truck
Mannie Fresh, a.k.a Warning, warning city a big ballin ass pimp comin
through
Chorus
tallking till end
