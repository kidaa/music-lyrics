[B.G.] 
Uh-huh
Ah, Ah, Woah, Woah
I'm a guerilla, I'm a dog, I'm a beast, I'm a snake
the type that will walk up and put 10 hollows to your face
I'm a tiger, I'm a lion, I'm a bear, I'm a panther
if you ballin' I'ma be the one that's gonna snatch ya
I'm a fool, when I'm beefin I give niggaz the blues
Don't think twice, first mind tell me do what I gotta do
So I gather up my clique, load up the fucking iron
gas up the creep mobile, jump in that bitch and ride
When I catch ya I'ma do ya, I'ma smoke ya, I'ma kill ya
I'ma spank ya, I'ma whack ya, Geezy gone deal witcha
I don't play, I don't asshole B.G. don't lollygag
I get these pussy niggaz ready for their body bag
I'ma a clown but I ain't the type that play with ya child
I'm the type that go chicka-blowe chicka blowe
Ya heard me, watch out when that thang in my hand
I'ma an untamed animal, straight a clean up man
Chorus 2X: [Juvenile]
I'ma animal in the jungle so you better beware
it ain't nothing but guerillas, lion, tigers, and bears
I'ma game red-nosed pit ready to scratch
got you running like a bitch tryin to avoid the attack
[B.G.]
I ain't no rabbit, I ain't no rat
I'ma a soldier that will give you hell
I ain't cat, I ain't no turtle get in beef and hide in a shell
I ain't no mutt, I ain't no monkie, far from being a duck
believe me I can swim so come in that water, try your luck
You gonna drown, guarantee you go under you won't come up
I'm from Uptown and Uptown niggaz don't give a fuck
My hood is a jungle full of niggaz live that wild life
picture a untamed guerilla with a KAK he nothing nice
so you know you get in his way, you lose your life
so reverse that, get in front of me, you lose your life
I'm like a alligator crocodile, quietly I lay
Then slip, get comfortable, I'll strike and kill a prey
take the life out  em', stand there and watch him stop breathing
watch him fade into the other world, but one day I'll see him
but for now FUCK em', see ya when I see ya nigga
I know at this moment I wouldn't wanna be ya nigga
Chorus
I'm a lil' creeper, quick like a cheetah, so better ?????
when I tell you freeze, when I was down for my heater
people say I'm dangerous, I need a leash and a collar
cuz I'm like a ROCK rocwilder but much more wilder
if You got it, and I want it, I'll duct tape ya
gotta a lock like a pit bull, get a hold of you and shake ya
ain't now way You gone stomp at me, I feel you trying to play me
I'm like Mike when I bite, I give ya bitch ass Rabies
From tree to tree, block to block I be hanging
Nuts swanging, thuggin, fuck it I'm looking mangy
I gives a fuck, I live wild life like jungle animals
catch Us gettin how we live on Discovery Channel
You gotta be a snake that creep and know how to survive
pussy cats got nine lives, dogs like me got one life
so we gotta manage it 
We feel threatened by anything we gotta handle it
We living scandalous
Chorus 
[animal and jungle sounds at the end]
