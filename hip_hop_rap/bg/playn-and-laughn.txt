[B.G.]
I try to maintain keep my head straight
But my surroundin' Niggas want half weight
So what the fuck all I see iz niggas heads peeled
I ain't got to many postive relatives people
Try to tell me right from wrong but man I think
I'm grown I ain't resepctin no nigga cuz my daddy gone
I'm on my own so let me be the B.G. I'm gonna be
Its an possiabilty I might see a key off Valence
Street all I want is green in my hand I ain't gonna
Say nothin' because shit doesn't always go as planned
I'm gonna do what I do wit my hustlin cuz I know
Somewhere out here they got a mill I'm gonna get it
I ain't waitin on the bitch to come to me
If that's the case I be waitin til eternity 
I'ma struggle and strive drink some wine
Doin bad thas fine I got my hand on my nine 
You bests believe I'm goin to get mine
You can take this to the bank nigga I'm gonna die tryin
Chorus: B.G.

To choices to rock the mic on my all night flight
One way or another success is in my future

Chorus
[B.G.]
Nigga I'm all bout da paper been a hustler for life
Always lay down and get mine even if I got to hang all night 
It's like they got to wait for you, they got to wait for me 
If I got to bust in disgust I'm gonna provide for the B.G.

Get the scale weigh the yay got eleven for sale
