Nigga we don't drop albums, we drop classics
Verse 1:
I ain't even gotta tell u how Cash Money Roll
I ain't even gotta tell  u we ballin outta control
Cause  we do shows all seven days of the week
Top of the line rides flying up and down the street
Any kind of car C.M.B Cash Money Boy$ boys could claim it
Lexus's, Benz's, & Truck MotorBikes you name it
Rollin all the time gotta get my shine on
Right here got the nine & in my left the PrimeCo Phone
Rap dues I done paid it

Nigga I been hustlin since twelve I done made it

He the greatest, but wait hold up, you ain't heard the latest
Million dollar contract a 150 pages, Not minimum
We makin maximum wages
Let me tell u about bayou classic how we played it
We hit Canal Canal Street so deep click  so strong
Every vehicle we rode in was on chrome
The Hummer sound had em' jumpin in the SuperDome
We got so much money we gave the bank a credit loan
We go shopping and spend 50 G's at the mall
But that hurt cause Cash Money go still ball 
Until We Fall
Chorus:
I ain't even gotta tell u how Cash Money Roll!
I ain't even gotta tell u we ballin outta control!
Repeat twice

Leather seats, sound bumpin all in your ears
The dress code:  t-shirts, Ree's Reebok Soldiers & Bauds Girbauds
It's 98,  my money stack  it dont  fold
I'm a livin legend, havin fire weed sessions
Hide your bitch cause I will have in my possession
I'm top notch, it ain't no secret I'm hot
You can spot,  my Rolex watch from down the block
I don't talk shit if I ain't  able to prove it
My wrist all bitch, Especially in the dark bitch
I'm a young nigga, tru 2 da game nigga, fog
And play'n with a little change nigga, fog
Fuck with me I put a little over your brain
But fuck that I ride and let my chopper rang nigga
Since 97 I got a lil thicker and taller
Chancin 6 figgaz, I'm the Cash Money Baller
Chorus: x3
Verse 3:
