B.G. representin' to the fullest
It's still an uptown thing nigga
Check it out
Verse 1: B.G.
I reside in the same place, nigga UPT
Represent the same war, VL 13
Still carry mine tighter, niggas real B.G.
Still tote my chopper, and my 2-23
Now Cash Money is my home, til I'm dead and gone
Disrespect you get split, cause you know right from wrong
Imma stand my ground, be all I can be
And shoot down everybody player hatin' me
I den been alot of places, I strapped around
But I never found a town like Uptown
Out, lounge all day, smoke weed by the pound
I cruise all day through the project bumpin' my sound
All these stunners hit it 6 under the ground
You were on the front row wearing that black gown
These rookies reppin' I done saw more, what ya'll den seen
Don't let me catch ya down bad, from the 3 to the 13
Chorus: B.G.
Uptowns my home, that's where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt, it's me or you on that shirt
Watch that infra red on Sunday it's going down
Look, I never found a town like Uptown
Uptowns my home, that's where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt, it's me or you on that shirt
Watch that infra red on Sunday it's going down
Look, I never found a town like uptown
Verse 2: B.G.
I represent off top, Uptowns the shit
B.G. rap hustling, nigga tryin' to get rich
Cash Money Records model, don't trust no bitch
Cause if she know when she got ya, jackers coming you all in
13-VL, the Hot Boys for sure
You get your wig split quick from the magnumcalio
Saint T got my tweeked out, but they got tortured
As I said it had me zzzed out, nigga zzzed out
For shit that Imma pull nigga
You fuck with me your swimming in a blood pool nigga
My AK-47, my main tool nigga
Spin off in the F150 with loud boom nigga
You want beef it's all on you nigga
I'm all ears, tell me what cha wanna do nigga
And we can get straight to it, don't move, I've got the red beem on ya
Bring how you feel, buster take it how you wanna
Chorus: B.G.
Repeat
Verse 3: B.G.
Second line Sunday Uptown thats the day bout stuntin'
Niggas in big bodies on chrome, got the trunk straight rumpin
You see them motorbike boys, niggas in z's
You see big trucks on 19's, shit with TV's
Nigga's who beefing dressed in black, I catch them off their P's
They play the game, very dirty in the UPT
Is iron slangin' all day is you ready for that
Nigga 9's ringing all day is you ready to bust back
If your not I think you're on the wrong side of the bridge
Niggas that south side the click, wootay guard your wig
In a second it could get split, I spin the Benz and the Rover
Ah, my chopper try to knock ya, yeah it should clean off your shoulder
You was a soilder, Imma tell ya, niggas stand your ground
