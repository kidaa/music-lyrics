let this be my writ of misanthropy 
to a thankless world of men 
who have perfected nothing. 
save the art of accusation. 

woe is he that feels compelled to pen 
even one word of hatred. 
the act is contemptible. 
to know i hate with the passion 
with which i love is a travesty. 
let this writ acknowledge these facts. 

how i miss the warmth of red blood... 
the color of pitch is cold and hard, 
and it is merciless to the tenderhearted. 

how i miss the strength of red blood... 
its susceptibility to burn jet, 
and the might to withstand a brutal scorching. 

how i have learned to wield this scorched, jet blood 
to the gross advantage... 
this blood must not go to waste. 
all is not yet lost. 

take these words of blood ill-temprered. 
take these words and 
cut deep. 
lacerate the soiled flesh. 
impact the brittle bone. 

and we all will bleed together. 
may this blood pave the way to solution. 

we have all been so wrong - 
conditioned to accept and approve of substandard 
communication and behavior. 
reason is clouding, 
hearts are hardening, 
and the result is murder. 
this age is grave bound, 
likewise its aging successors. 
aging, all the while, descending - 
developing an even more insatiable thirst for chaos. 
life amongst hyenas and asps under the vultures 
that pick at the corpses of the fallen. 

and man will continue to suffer unto itself 
until some stand to rally the fray by firm example 

chaos must succumb to order 
lest these days be numbered 

i cannot contribute to disarray 
i simply cannot relate 

let this be my act of defiance. 
let this be my refusal to fit in 
let this be my writ of misanthropy...
