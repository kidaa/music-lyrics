Human is a degrading word
As human, I renounce myself
I yield to no man
There will be no peace
Not on Earth
Not amongst men
Indulge
Be content
Soften yourselves
I look beyond weakness and fashion
Confide not in flesh
If i can change the world
Il disregard it
And look beyond
Pray to calm my heart
Pray for the fools
I will be at peace
I am not a man
And your actions will speak alone.
