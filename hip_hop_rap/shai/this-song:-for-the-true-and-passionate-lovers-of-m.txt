this song: 
i have this song: to sing 
certian words must be screamed 
rather than be sung or spoken: 

i am alive and vigorous... 

...as they toil without love. 
fight without purpose, 
and live without passion... 

i am alive and vigorous. 

in this song: is where i belong. 

within these moments 
there are no outsiders. 
within the body of the song: 
time stands still. 
one is al, 
and all is beautiful - 
the beautiful moment of song and passion. 

we will all sing. 
we will all dance. 

if a human's nature is to war, 
this song: 
is a battleground, 
and this voice, 
a weapon 
one thousand voices - 
or trumpet call 
to arms. 

passion's promise; 
true love's reward - 
a pure expression 
in truth and sincerity. 

passion's promise: 
true love's reward, is this song: 

what will become of this song:... 

pray not a fallen banner, 
or screamed words to the deaf, 
for life is weary without song, or sound of harps. 

this is a song for the impassioned. 
this is strength for the heards on sleeves - 
a shining sentiment where voices soar 
and melod wells tears in the eyes. 

we will all sing the same song, 
this song, 
together.
