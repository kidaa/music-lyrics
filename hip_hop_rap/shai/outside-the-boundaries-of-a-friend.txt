Avoid the mirror lest I break it.
With the stone that serves as my heart.
Accept this pretty package named friend.
Except this it entails love.
Not so attractive anymore.
Accept this pretty package named friend.
Except that it entails love.
It never as pretty as it seems and now it never was at all.
No it never was.
All I asked was to be important.
All I wanted was someone to trust
In my eternal scheme, your act of friendship means nothing.
Friendships are weak and nothing is dear to me
Acquaintance stole my confidence.
My humor.
My compassion.
My solace.
Left me with myself and laughed as it walked away
I refuse to be your tolerance, I will not be your embarrassment.
I'm not so attractive any more.
Take this burden away.
I can only stand in front of a broken mirror for so long
Staring at the reflection of failed attempts at love and a black heart.
My heart, once nourished with hope and compassion, now is black as death.
Trudging forward, broken, devoid of love
I am nothing more than scars.
