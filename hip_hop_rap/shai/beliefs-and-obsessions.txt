Lies of self-indulgent pride
A sense of justice misdirected for the sake of the lost
A claim to inflict punishment for those who have been unjust
And there a line that can be crossed between belief and obsession
Nonexistent caring based on situation ethics.
No benefit can come from the line being drawn.
To be guided by faith, is to be.
Is to be mislead.
A joke to the weak, a fixation to the strong.
So who wrong, and who will decide what right?

With so few actions, so many words.
Won take this complacency anymore.
I won accept the criticism of my peers
I won accept this objection.
I cannot judge others lives only to justify my own
One more word and I broken
One more word.
