MISERY,SUCH A FOOL TO LET YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME
NOW IT SEEMS THERE' S NOBODY THERE FOR ME
GIRL I' M IN AGONY,FOR YOU
GONE WITHOUT A TRACE
NEVER KNEW THAT LOVE WAS SUCH A LONELY PLACE
DAMN I NEED YOUR LOVIN JUST TO FEEL THIS SPACE
I' M IN SO MUCH PAIN WITHOUT YOU
LEFT ME HERE ALONE
WHY DON' T YOU COME BACK HOME TO ME EVERYBODY HELP ME SING NOW

CHORUS
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU BELONG
RIGHT HERE IN MY ARMS
WITHOUT YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG

WAITING FOR YOUR CALL
CAN' T HELP THINKIN THAT
THIS MESS IS ALL MY FAULT
JUST TO HAVE YOU BACK I SWEAR I' D RISK IT ALL
MY EVERY THOUGHT IS OF YOU
GIRL I' M ON MY KNEES
BEGGIN FOR FORGIVENESS AND YOUR SYMPATHY
MOST OF ALL MY LOVE I MISS YOUR COMPANY
THE ONLY THING I NEED IS YOU
NEED YOU BACK MY FRIEND
SO I CAN BREATHE AGAIN
COME BACK HOMEEVERYBODY HELP ME SING IT

CHORUS
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU BELONG
RIGHT HERE IN MY ARMS
WITHOUT YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG

BRIDGE

CHORUS
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU BELONGRIGHT HERE IN MY ARMS
WITHOUT YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG
