A discontent for the vile and the wretched
Will bring forth reparations of the most severe degree
Things will change
And I will be the catalyst to
Weed out the weak and beget strength of character
Glorifying minds and souls
Celebrate the spirit while denying breath and life
To those who would choose to live depraved
Depravity, a thing of the past
A life not in vain
I am the end, I am beginning life anew
My soul is free from weakness
Free
Refined as gold
A standard to be met by all
As we embrace righteousness, we embrace life
Purified, united. set aside from the majority
I will serve as an example to man as hope
By defending those I love with my life
I stand here bold and strong
As a testament to my abstinence
My heart is open; this slate is clean.
