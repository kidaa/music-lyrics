the salt from my eye burns 
as does the acid of my tongue. 

might a tempest relieve me of sound and sight. 
might i unearth the hatched 
and put it to proper use 

my hand is poised, and in fury. 

only thunder gives me rest. 

dare me to breathe 
when i can't catch my breath. 
sway my temper's balance. 

only thunder gives me rest.
