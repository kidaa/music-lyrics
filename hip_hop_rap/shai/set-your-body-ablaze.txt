from flesh to steel i'll fortify...

fortify this, easily splintered bone into a stronghold of will.
as the balance of man lay beaten in the wake of its own frailty.

hollow words will burn and hollow men will burn

a horde eager to accept deceit, and more so to speak it
words will seer the throats of all who freely beguile, the trught burns in my 
veins and in my black heart, breathe the flames that will overwhelm you. flaw 
ignites swiftly.

a product of conceit, so absorbed and vain, that he thinks himself divine. he 
is sure to die.

...deprived of life...

and man must truly be god; for he is tried so hard to create me in his image, 
deprived of life a formless shadow deprived of life.

I am the wayward son of man, my fathers have darkened what was the warmest 
heart the world would have ever known, relish in what you have created.

deprived of life a formless shadow deprived of life

set your body ablaze! hollow words will burn and hollow men will burn
