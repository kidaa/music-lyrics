brilliance, 
a heart of gold, 
and a voice that whispers, 
"i am wholly miserable." 

he is the most miserable of men. 
every word he speaks reeks of failure. 
he has failed where others 
have succeeded threefold. 
this failure suffers 

what is a man 
that is the source of his own misery... 
to face a lifelong nightmare 
of taunting dreams is unbearable. 
what is this man, 
a dark prophet... 
a dark prophecy... 

suffering knows no end, 
nor does his appetite for it 
opt for the darkest corner and brood. 
keep closed your eyes. 
keep turned your back. 
tomorrow is dead. 

tomorrow is dead. 
today is the grave. 
yesterday he secured a tomb. 

time has been cruel. 
why should time be any different than life 
when tomorrow is dead 

his shame. 

he will lie between 
resentment and regret. 
he shed his grace. 
as certian as a snake sheds its skin. 
laid waste to a wealth of talent - 
his curse of being blessed with treasures 
that just were not gold enough. 

his endless misfortune
