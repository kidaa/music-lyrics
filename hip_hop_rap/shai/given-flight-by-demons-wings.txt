this is not my true nature. 
i was not born as what i have come to be. 

to be gentle again... 

an angel's heart given flight by demon's wings faces certian death. 

do not let this exterior deceive you. 
i can easily crush your spirit. 
my wounds bleed truth, 
their voices are caustic, 
and with the words... 
a nasty sting from aim and precision of fact. 

"how can you be so cruel?" 

it is not who i am, 
as it is the hate i feel. 

i am a demon, 
a vicious fiend. 
let me alone. 
i am a demon with a penchant 
for other's misery. 
i am a demon, 
a vicious fiend. 
let me alone 
in peace 
to be the beast of a man 
the world has made me. 

i am prepared to fight humanity every day 
for the rest of my life, 
albeit, my mind and body 
yearn for tranquility. 

people that should earn my love 
consistently warrant my hate. 
i truly resent this. 

breathe easy, friend. 
let not bitter fruit sour your breath. 
you were once a gentleman. 

when friends fail, 
and mother is gone; 
when god is silent, 
and mates fall out of love... 

i still wake to confrontation, 
alone, and unflinching. 

i am not simply strong, 
i may very well be the strongest man 
that ever lived.
