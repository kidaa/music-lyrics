Poured myself out:
I am the empty cup
My hope has died away
And my tolerance faded.

How can I keep Stability
On such shaky ground?
Prayers that a smile will flag me down.

Sadly Ie learned there no truth in comfort;
Well-being stems not from love.
Anguish proves to be my only means of solace,
Yet I want to be held by anyone,
With any arms

I spend another morn alone
In a world that rejects me.
A public unkind, laced with apathy.
This one for the world: I hate you.

Life could get no colder;
I living out a dying cell,
But I can pull through.
