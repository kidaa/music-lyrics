without pretension. 
with a sweet chill down my spine... 

for a time the clouds lift, and what i have resigned to thinking barren 
does bear fruit. 

if i am to die - if i must die, 
i must inspire while i live, 
alongside the dreamers. 

let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams 

i surrender all. all i have to give: 

those who have survived lifes thorns 
and provided escape. 
to those, whose creations live forever. 
to those that wrote the words, 
though my knees become weak, 
i will cause my foot another step. 
to carry the task. 
and to those that understood 

there is a need for faith 
and a need for hope 

let us at last praise the colonizers of dreams 

as with the brightest and the wisest, 
i know the need of faith, hope, and dreams. 

i burn for vision and inspiration, for this is life. 

if perchance i am dreaming, 
please, let me sleep. 

to spend my time in great atlantis, 
in search of camelot. 
i drink from the grail, and war with the immortals, 
rather than sulk in the ruins of a fallen sky castle. 

amidst the remnants of once 
mighty colossus, 
comes this call: 
where are the builders? 

i clearly see the slayers, and the hope they destroy. 
i clearly see the thieves, and the wonders they deprive the inspired. 

where are the builders? 

if i am to die - if i must die, 
i must inspire while i live, 
alongside the dreamers.
