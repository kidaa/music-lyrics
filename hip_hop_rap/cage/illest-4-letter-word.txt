Test Test.. 

[cage] 
You wanna kill me nigga? 

[Announcer] 
All the way live, we bring to you to host the annual drowning, in Lake 
Michigan.. 

Verse 1: 

[cage] 
I heard some blonde bitch walking through New York looking for cage 
I'll stab you in the face, ten times in the same place 
Lace your little infants til you thinking different 
When in the same building on the street lift you off your feet 
Wont chill then, Microsibling to my cock 
Dribbling, Scribbling verses 
For the worthless, Fuck a million purses 
Keep the doctor to remove the slug 
I bug when I stand close simple 
Took you in the club 
Something for ya enterauge 
Something for your body guards 
History shows rappers die in there cars 
They lost one in the west, we lost one in the east 
Should I drown you in lake michigan or buck you in miamibeach 

Chorus: 
[Cage] 
The illest four letter word in the world is cage! 
Ya better all fucking suck cock or ya'll gettin aids 

Bitch The illest four letter word in the world is cage! 
Bitch the illest four letter word in the world is cage! 
Ya better all fucking suck cock or ya'll gettin aids 

The Illest four letter word in the world is cage! 

Verse 2 

[cage] 
The illest four letter word in the world, supporter 
rhyme slaughter, listen to the death save the gun for the 
Blonde Ambition, fell off the christian wagon 
Your systems saggin biting my shit and Im laughing 
I can freak simple shit and sell records where I go 
I write the illest shit that cross fans in the biter zones 
Keep your guards by your guard you showing cards on the low 
See a man gotta deal, Now you look just like quote 
All you schizophrenics need help with reality 
Kill your two little personalities 
Shark getting snuck a salary 
Observe gravity pullin ya in to earth gradually 
You'll see you need a style I create to try and battle me 

Chorus 

Verse 3 

[cage] 
Stick an electro shock that you cant understand 
I wreck intellects slanted brains like japan 
My An-ger's a result of sick lust 
Wont you come and injure us with there brains stringed up 
I've never contemplated while hallucinating 
my existence aiding those with imaginations and mental disorders Cosaving 
Im training 
My lost love leaves princess to interest a subtle slut 
To puff bundles of dust 
At bars while she rocks a star we get raw 
I keep scratching her clit with salad tongs 
Fucked her up against the intercom 
So my next sound pierce the ear 
We're buggin like an insect laying larva in ya ear 

Chorus Fade to End
