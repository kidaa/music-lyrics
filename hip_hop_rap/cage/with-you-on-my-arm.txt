Albin:
I couldn't possibly take one tiny little step.
Georges:
With me you could...
Albin:
No, I couldn't!
Georges:
Life is a celebration with you on my arm. 
Albin:
I'm too upset!
Georges:
That's because you're not listening! 
Life is a celebration with you on my arm.
It's worth the aggrevation with you on my arm. 
Albin:
Well, you always did bounce back quicker than I.
Georges:
That's because I'm more limber!
Albin:
You always were. 
Georges:
Each time I face a morning that's boring and bland,
With you it looks good.
Albin:
I can't dance!
Georges:
You can!
With you it looks great.
Albin:
Do I have to?
Georges:
If you want me!
With you it looks grand.
Albin:
Like the old days, aha!
Georges:
Aha!
Albin:
Mm...Aha!
Georges:
On you it looks good.
On you it looks great.
On you it looks grand.
Both:
Somehow you've put a permanent star in my eye.
Even the dead of Winter can feel like July.
I found a combination that works like a charm:
Georges:
It's suddenly... [KISS]
Albin:
It's suddenly...
Both:
Aah!
Georges:
Whenever it's you...
Albin:
Whenever it's you...
Georges:
Follow me!
Both:
Whenever it's you...
Whenever it's you...
Whenever it's you on my arm!
