Dindon:
Your parents? What parents? Oh, one of them might possibly 
be your father, but you can't tell me that that the other one is 
your mother.
Jean-Michel:
That's precisely who HE is!
Dindon:
I see no mother here.
Jean-Michel:
I do!

How often is someone concerned 
With the tiniest thread of your life?
Concerned with whatever you feel
And whatever you touch?
Look over there.
Look over there.
Somebody cares that much.
So count all the loves who will love me
From now 'til the end of my life,
And when you have added the loves
Who have loved me before,
Look over there.
Georegs and Jean-Michel:
Look over there.
Somebody loves me you more...
