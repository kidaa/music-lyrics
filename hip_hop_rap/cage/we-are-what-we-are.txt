M.C.:
Bon soir! Bon soir! Here we are at the "pride" of Saint Tropez, 
the "envy" of the cabaret world, the "jewel" of the Riviera! Only
champagne from now to the finale... Monsieur-Dames, I beg 
you, open your eyes...you have arrived at "LA CAGE AUX FOLLES" 

Les Cagelles:
We are what we are and what we are is an illusion.
We love how it feels
Putting on heels causing confusion.
We face life though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter;
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: Girdles and jocks,
Proving we are what we are!

We are what we are - Half a brassiere, half a suspender.
Half real and half fluff,
You'll find it tough guessing our gender.
So Just [WHISTLE] "Hey, Taxi!"
If we please you that's the way to show us.
Just [WHISTLE] Wolf-call
'Cause you'll love us once you get to know us.
Look under our glitz: Muscles and tits, 
Proving we are what we are.

We face life though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter,
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: Girdles and jocks,
Proving we are what we are!

[INTERLUDE - TAPS]

Aaah...Un! Deux! Trois! Quatre! Cinq! Six! Sept! Huit!
Ah, Saint Tropez
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 

So Just [WHISTLE] "Hey, Taxi!"
If we please you that's the way to show us.
Just [WHISTLE] Wolf-call
'Cause you'll love us once you get to know us.
Weeeeeeeeeeeeee face life though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter,
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: Girdles and jocks,
Proving we are what we aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaare!
Yeow!
