I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time

If I don't break all the lies that I make
I'll only leave them for you
If I could hear your voice on the phone
It's better then being alone

I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
For the first time

A butterfly flies and a birds don't swim
You told me again and again
But if I don't do all the things that you do
It doesn't mean there's no where to begin

I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
For the first time

I'll take all the gold I thought was mint
And I'd trade it for a minute of time
So I keep waiting

I'll light the sun
And the darkness will turn into light
Now I see the world for the first time
For the first time
For the first time
