Blasting down the highway
 In my Batmobile.
 You squealed in delight,
 We're going to Paris.
 Caught between my passport
 And a rootbeer float.
 I turned the car around,
 Cause you made fun of me.
 You tell me I'm
 Ridiculous.
 A clown,
 So preposterous.
 Who would believe the
 King was the Joker,
 Hiding behind
 His confidence?
