Chorus:
All the ladies in the club 
Not ready to give the party up 
Lift your hands up 
Let me hear you say hey 
A little louder hey hey 
Sing it louder hey 
All the fellas show some love 
Come on then give it up 
Lift your hands up 
Let me hear you say hey 
A little louder hey hey 
Sing it louder hey 

Oh no, it's 3am 
And the party is still jumpin' 
And the club it is about to close down 
DJ tellin' everyone to get out 
But the girls and I ain't ready to go 
The night is young and we ain't tryna go home 
So we gotta find another spot 
'Cause you know the party ain't gon' stop, no 

Lets roll and not stop 
It's on to the next block 
The party is hot and won't stop 'til 6 o'clock 
Everyone come on along 
We're gonna have some fun oh yeah 

Chorus

Oh no it's time to go 
Everyone's finished but don't wanna go home 
We gotta find another place to be 
Let's get somewhere 'cause it's still early 
Everybody meet outside 
Pump some music in your ride 
Don't worry about the time 
'Cause we're gonna kick it tonight 

Forget about the clock 
Take everything we got 
And make our own hot spot 
Right in the parking lot 
Play the hot songs 
Get your drink on 
Find a partner 
And get your grove on 

Chorus

Had to leave the club 
Tore the party up 
Now it's up to us 
To make our own fun 
So stick around 
We just might do it all night 
Can't go home with you 
Hangin' with my crew 
Doing what we do 
So if you're really down 
Then gather round 
And sing it out hey 

Ladies 
Fellas 
Get your hands up 

All the ladies in the club 
All the fellas show some love 
All the ladies 
All the ladies 
All the fellas 
All the fellas 

All the ladies in the club 
All the fellas show some love 
All the ladies 
All the ladies 
All the fellas 
All the fellas 

Chorus

The party ain't gon' stop 
'Cause we know how to keep it hot 
Fellas show some love 
Ladies lift your hands up 
I like it with your crew 
Turn this party out with you 
Ladies, fellas get together 
Let me hear you say hey hey
