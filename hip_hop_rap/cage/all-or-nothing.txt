Hmm, hmm 
Ooh, mmm yeah 

Here's the chance of life 
Get ready, get set, fly, high 
Above the fear of your mind 
Go for it 
It's hit or miss 
Too late for you to quit 
You gotta show them how bad you really want this, oh 

1 - Live your dreams 
It's not as hard as it may seem 
You gotta work to get the cream 
On your hopes you will see 
From your fears, you have to win yourself 
It's all or nothing 
Give your everything 

All what you believe 
You got to bring the heat 
Set the pace, competition take the lead 
This is it, all eyes on you 
So stay on point and pray 
That you deserve what's long overdue 

Repeat 1 

I'm still recovering 
From the heartbreak of another kind 
I'm still drying my tears 
Getting over my own fears 
Live my life, so I wanna make sure it's tight 
That I'm strong enough to give it my all 

Repeat 1 

Oh, oh, oh, live your dreams 

Repeat 1 till end
