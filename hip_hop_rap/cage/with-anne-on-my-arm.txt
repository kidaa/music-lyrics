Jean-Michel:
Girls have come and gone, Papa.
Angelique and Antoinette.
Or did I prefer Leslie or Hlne?
It was all a blur, and yet, Papa,
When Anne comes running down the street,
I link my arm in hers,
Girls have come and gone,
Girls may come and go,
But something very odd occurs, Papa.
'Cause life is in perfect order with Anne on my arm.
It makes my shoulders broader with Anne on my arm.
Even when things won't gel, and the pieces won't fit,
I'm suddenly in, I'm suddenly on, I'm suddenly "it".
Who else can make me feel like I'm handsome and tall?
Who else can make me feel I'm on top of it all?
I found a combination that works like a charm:
I'm simply a man who walks on the stars
Whenever it's Anne on my arm!
Life is a celebration with you on my arm.
Walking's a new sensation with you on my arm.
Each time I face a morning that's boring and bland,
With you it looks good, with you it looks great, 
With you it looks grand!
Somehow, you've put a permanent star in my eye.
Even the dead of Winter can feel like July.
We start a conflagration that's cause for alarm.
We're giving off sparks, we're setting off bells,
Whenever it's you on my arm.
Who else can make me feel like I'm handsome and tall?
Who else can make me feel I'm on top of it all?
I found a combination that works like a charm:
I'm simply a man who walks on the stars,
Whenever it's Anne on my arm!
