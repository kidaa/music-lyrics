Jean-Michel:
No, you're with the French Foreign Service!
George:
Sir!
I joined the Foreign Legion with a sabre in my hand.
I crawled across the desert with my belly in the sand.
With men who loved their camels and their brandy and I swear,
Nobody dished, 
Nobody swished when I was a Foreign Legionnaire.
Jean-Michel:
Would you like an hors d'oeuvre?
Anne:
Let me help.
Marie:
How adorable these dishes are. Are these youngsters playing together?
Dindon: They look like Greeks.
Georges:
Oh, no, no, there wouldn't be any Greeks on my plate...unless they weren't washed well.
Marie:
Well, young boys in any case.
Georges:
No, there must be girls too. This is a mixed service.
Marie:
Oh, what lovely dishes! 
They're so delicate and frail.
Mine have naked children;
I believe they're only male.
Oops! I think they're playing some exoctic, little game...
Oops! I think that "Leap-frog" it is the name.
Jean-Michel:
Anyway, she's very sorry.
Dindon:
This is even worse than I feared
The son is strange,
The father is weird.
To meet the wife, I'm actually afraid 
I prefer that Anne remain an old maid.
Georges:
My wife and I are devoted couple. 
And my son knows how much I love him and to what extremes, 
but my wife... Oh I love her like an ani-mal.
Jacob:
It's apalling to confess:
Our new in-laws are a mess.
She's a prude, he's a prig, 
She's a pill, he's a pig, 
So zis zis zis for you, Papa.
