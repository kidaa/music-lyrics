I put the pedal in smut, fucked a tape deck, nut 
Got your play button stuck, my eyes WIDE shut 
Comin' out my face on stage, put lumps in your throat 
Like I hung you off the roof from six feet of rope 
I give away rhymes for you to battle me wit' 
While I do MCs like Yugoslav intelligence 
Sold a flick back [???] 
You open a barrel of worms - now the atmosphere reeks 
Of little kids with dreams of rhymes they wanna tell 
'Til pedophile labels come molest them with sales 
Big shot producers, pelletgun MCs 
Stand by watching in the breeze... 

[Chorus x2] 
This world's a commercial! I can't change the channel! 
Every day try and kill it, but there's no ammo! 
And television heads is feds that wanna hurt you 
I found a way out, but ain't nowhere to merc' to 

In flesh I stress the day-to-day vision 
Threw on a condom 
Now I'm sponsored by Trojan 
Walking Polo ad, rap fad MTV 
Grab every face of the nation 
Througho ptical examination 
Feedin ya bleedin ya through media brain leavin' ya 
Touch the magazine and it seep in ya 
So I train on Playstation in army apparel and 
Get lost in the TV world like Carolyn 
Scan my finger for the credit 
Miscountin' dough? Forget it 
There's a pale white horse in town and everybody fed it 
Sky's black, my eyes crack, I think I'm 'sleep 
I cleanse my thoughts with courtships of leak' 

[Chorus x2]
