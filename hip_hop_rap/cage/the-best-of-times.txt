Albin:
This is a little song,
Nostalgic and unique-eh!
I learned to sing this song before I learned to speak-eh!
I learned to sing this song 
Upon my mother's knee,
And she learned to sing this song
Upon her mother's knee,
And her mother learned this song
Upon her mother's knee,
And if your mother sang that little song to you,
Then sing along with me.

The best of times is now.
What's left of Summer 
But a faded rose?
The best of times is now.
As for tomorrow,
Well, who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
So hold this moment fast,
And live and love 
As hard as you know how.
And make this moment last
Because the best of times is now, 
Is now, is now.
Now, not some forgotten yesterday.
Now, tomorrow is too far away.
So hold this moment fast,
And live and love 
As hard as you know how.
And make this moment last,
Because the best of times is now, 
Is now, is now.
