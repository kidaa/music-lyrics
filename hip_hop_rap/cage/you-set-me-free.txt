If I wanted to could there still be me and you 
I'd wait for the storm to pass, then we could make it last 
If I was you and you were me, then I could make you see, 
All the love and the time we gave away 
Because I still see you turn to walk away 

There's no light and there no sound 
And there's no relied without your love around 
I try to say you'll be back someday 
But there's only me and you, you set me free, you set me free, you set me free 

If I could only know, then I'd tell you where to go 
Where you wouldn't have to run, and we could be as one 
If you were me and I was you, You'd know what I'm going through 
Every hour, every second, today 
Because I still see you turn to walk away 

There's no light and there no sound 
And there's no relied without your love around 
I try to say you'll be back someday 
But there's only me and you, you set me free, you set me free, you set me free 

Maybe I would be better, If I threw out the letters 
That I keep inside, that I keep inside 
Maybe I would be better, If I threw out the letters 
And I should go outside, I should go outside 

There's no light and there no sound 
And there's no relied without your love around 
I try to say you'll be back someday 
But there's only me and you, you set me free 
you set me free 
you set me free 
you set me free
