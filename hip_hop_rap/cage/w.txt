There's a guy
Who lives in a palace
Drinks the night away
Just to
Forget the here and now
His family couldn't stay
Everytime that evening
Comes around
Then the bottle comes to town
I can't say with
Full assurance
What he's going through
But I pray
Someday he'll realize
What this world is coming to
Hope that somehow he feels sorry now
Breaking promises and vows
Everyone around
is getting hurt
I know everyone around is getting hurt

Chorus
Hey You
You can do what you wanna do
But someday
You're gonna reap it too
That's the law of love
Jesus said  You shall love your God
With all your heart
You shall love your neighbor
As yourself
That's the law of love
Of love
That's the law of love

There's a girl
Who lived with her parents
Then she ran away
It's been days
No sign of the little girl
No she wouldn't stay
All those years of hatred broke her heart
Without love they grew apart
Some stranger comes around
Says come and live with me
And she goes
Soon days have
Turned to months
Mom and dad now see
As they think of all the years gone by
If only they could
Turn the tides
Everyone around
Is getting hurt
Yes I know everyone around
Is getting hurt

Chorus

There is someone passin' by
Who's desperate inside
Who just needs to be loved
And helped too
There's someone who is dying
On the edge of suicide
And you can turn the light on
With God's love

Chorus
