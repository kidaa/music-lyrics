Albin:
Here at "LA CAGE" we live life - how should I put it? On angle! 
Not to worry. You'll soon get your bearings. Just take a deep breath, 
a sip of champagne and open your eyes. What do you see?

It's rather gaudy but it's also rather grand.
And while the waiter pads your check he'll kiss your hand.
The clever gigolos romance the wealthy matrons
At La Cage Aux Folles.
It's slightly forties, and a little bit "New Wave".
You may be dancing with a girl who needs a shave.
Where both the riffraff and the royalty are patrons
At La Cage Aux Folles.
La Cage Aux Folles,
The Maitre d' is dashing,
Cage Aux Folles,
The hat check girl is flashing,
We import the drinks that you buy,
So the Perrier is Canada Dry.
Eccentric couples always punctuate the scene.
A pair of eunuchs and a nun with a marine.
To feel alive you get a limousine to drive you 
To La Cage Aux Folles.
Angelique:
It's bad and beautiful, 
It's bawdy and bizarre.
Albin:
I know a Duchess who got pregnant at the bar.
Albin and Angelique:
Just who is who and What is What 
Is quite a question at La Cage Aux Folles.
Angelique, Trio, Albin:
Go for the mystery, the magic and the mood.
Paulette:
Avoid the hustlers,
Angelique:
And the men's room,
Two Men:
And the food.
All:
For you get glamour and romance and indigestion
At La Cage Aux Folles.
La Cage Aux Folles, a Sait Tropez tradition,
Cage Aux Folles 
You'll lose each inhibition,
Albin:
All week long we're wondering who
Left a green Givenchy gown in the loo.
All:
You go alone to have the evening of your life.
Albin:
You meet your mistress 
And your boy-friend and your wife.
All:
It's a bonanza, it's a mad extravaganza,
At La Cage Aux Folles.

Boy? Girl?
Oui? Non?
Hot. Cold.
Chaud. Froid. N'est pas?
Want? Like? Call me!

Albin:
You'll be so dazzled by the ambience you're in.
You'll never notice that there's water in the gin.
Come for a drink and you may wanna spend the Winter
At La Cage Aux Folles.
La Cage Aux Folles, a Saint Tropez tradition,
Cage Aux Folles 
You'll lose each inhibition,
We indulge each change in your mood.
Come and sip your Dubonnet in the nude.
