Check 
Me and Sonny in the Escalade, TV where yo' head lay 
Uptown, Harlem World, seein  
With some bran-bran, got a jaw hit  
Hun'ned G's for the suit, the hood like "oh man" 
Bendin corna's, twenty-two's, no dubbin, crrrrrrrrrrrr 
That's what you hear 'cause that shit be rubbin 
I gotta fix that, ooh, damn, who is that 
Dark skin, five-ten, twist, and kinda thick 
Pull this bitch over, so I can do what I do 
Get digits, call later, and teach you about you 
Mami giggle and smile, said she diggin my style 
Country boy, rugged for life, never come off foul 
Ahhh, put you on a team with me 
First class to the Bahamas, the scenery 
When I walked off, she called me back on the scene 
Like "who the St. Lunatics and what them double 'Bs' mean" 

[Chorus]
The double 'B' stands for the, chhhchhh, boom da boom 
Lunatic bass and beats, catch ya shakin the room 
So what, what, bomp, bomp 
What, what, this shit bomp 
The double 'B' stands for the, chhhchhh, boom da boom 
Lunatic bass and beats, catch ya shakin the room 
So what, what, bomp, bomp 
What, what, this shit bomp 

I got a size double D waitin at the double tree for me 
Ecstasy pills, Crissy and them Swisher Sweets 
With enough dough, to make a cake from scratch 
We the best, do the knowledge niggas, face the facts I said that 
Draped in black in the back, with that, thing that go, chhchh-pat 
Indeed, truck so big we gotta pull over to pass the weed, it's a tragedy 
How my neck, shine in the moonlight 
Give me one chance to show that ass what ya man ain't doin right 
It's a hundred percent chance mami, what 
Leave with me I'm in them pants mami 
Cotton soft, put it in first and jetted off 
Pumpin it loud so she can hear Jay-E floss 
While we got it warm, bitches is startin to swarm 
Lunatic be the chain, double 'B' be the charm 

[Chorus]

Took a limo to the airport, got a show down south 
Club one-twelve, showin 'em what that L about 
Holla at my nigga Ray-Ray 
Drop the top in four, hit the switch, we bumpin "Dre Day" 
Hey, hey, hey, what can I say 
Hit the liquor store for blunts, gin and O.J. 
'Cause I just bought a half, Chico dropped it off 
It's sunny, bitches out, and I'm dyin to floss, you don't say 
Ain't a damn thing that I won't buy 
I don't lie, money to the sky, shop 'til I die 
'Cause you know I got the greenery 
Five G's in the mall ain't a thing to me 
I do that, in a minute, gave my wife the Infinite 
Dubbed it up, fuck ballin, nigga, I'm winnin the pennet 
Now that we in it, you know that we gon' do it for sure 
Before we go let me tell you one thing that you should know 

[Chorus]

The double 'B' stands for the, chhhchhh, boom da boom
