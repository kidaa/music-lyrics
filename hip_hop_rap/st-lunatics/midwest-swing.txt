[Chorus - Nelly] 

It's a Midwest thang y'all 
And ain't got a clue Ain't got a clue 
Why my Cutlass blue 
And I got them thangs on that motherfucker too 
It's a Midwest Swang y'all 
Ain't gotta trip Ain't gotta trip 
While we swing and dip Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
Cuz we do big thangs 
On the motherfuckin' hip 

[Verse 1 - Nelly] 

What you think, we live on a farm Nigga, be for real 
We got Benz's, Rovers' and Jag's, Hummer's and Deville's 
Got a green S Class, ain't broke the do' seal 
Shit ain't been the same since I signed Fo' Reel 
This shit got ill, when I hit 4 mil 
Five and countin', dirty six at will 
Did seven on the slide, 8 worldwide 
I'll be on my third Bentley by the time I'm at 9 
I hear'em cryin', "You gon' sell out" 
Ya damn right, I done sold out before 
And re-caught the same night 
Straight hopped the next flight 
Too *Icey* for sunlight 
Dunkin' without Sprite, yea you heard me dirty
I'm from the Show-Me State 
Show me seven I'll show you eight 
Karats in one bling, heavily starched jeans 
Representin' St. Louis everytime I breathe 
In the city I touch down, and I bob and weave, ay 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Murphy Lee] 

I sport my beeper on my boots 
That's why I be a buzz when I kick 
Maybe it's on my lips, it's chaos when I spit 
Quarter man, quarter schoolboy, half Lunatic 
Quarter rubber, quarter dick, other half in yo' shit 
Keep a quarter of some sheeeiit 
I'm the Pookey of the backyard 
All colors and all types like a junkyard 
High young boy with high young ways 
Cuz I connect three blunts and be high for three days 
You can tell by the way I walk I ain't from 'round hurr here 
Probably couldn't tell cuz I ain't walkin' nowhurr nowhere 
I got a old-school Cutlass, with a hole in the urr air 
TV's urrwhurr everywhere wood grain to sturr stare 
I don't curr care, hell naw I ain't cuttin' my hurr hair 
10 and a half in the Airforce Ones, give me two purr pair ugh 
I'm from the Lou and what I do is a Lou thang 
One rapper, two rings and three chains 

[Verse 3 - Kyjuan] 

Nothing but some ole country boys that ride V12 horses 
Saddle up and put spurs on my Airforce's 
Back porches made for hide and go seek 
We got space out here, we can ride and cheif 
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us 
By the time they catchin' up, we smokin' up 
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark 
St. Louis sportin' the Rams, Cards and lil' Arch 
My dirty's love to spark, and love to sparkle 
Love homies *Vokal* coats with matchin' cargos 
We racin' down Skinker, see how fast a car go 
Granny be like "Ay, ya ya" like Ricky Ricardo 
I know you wanna know why we do what we do 
You cats ain't got a clue why the Cutlass blue 
Brand new 22's on new UP's 
With one, two, three, four, five TV's 

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 [Big Lee A.K.A. Ali]

I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin' a hood rhyme 
Waitin' on my connect to deliver that good line 
Wish I would find, one seed in my weed 
Sticks and shit, if I do somebody bleed 
Pull right here, eight pounds of Chinamen 
Two stay hittin some blunts and Heineken 
Hidin' in the back with the po' po' 
Stickin' my do'do', man they some ho' hooo's 
They put the gun to my earr 
You know the law don't fear 
Nann nigga, nann hoe, let's keep that bullshit clearr 
They had me face down in the skreet street 
Errbody everybody watchin', thinkin' Ima pull the heat 
And leave the D-tects with a leak in the skreet street 
And that - pussy ass nigga that set me up my peeps 
Gon' give it to this nigga like NYPD 
Beat the K, fuck coke, now I'm back on my granny poche porch hustlin' 

[Chorus til fade out]
