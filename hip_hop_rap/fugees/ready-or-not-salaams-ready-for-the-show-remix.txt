[Wyclef] 
I'm just about done... 
Yo, let me finish tuning this guitar... 
Yo, y'all ready for the show? 

[Lauryn "L-Boogie" Hill Chorus]  Wyclef in parentheses 
Ready Or Not!  Yo! - Wyclef 
Here we come!  Uh Huh 
All the biting M.C.'s and the pirates, I go run!  Come on, come on 
Why?'Cause they are old! 
And... And we are young! 
Uh huh...and  And while we're young, yes we're gonna have some fun!  Yo! 
Here it comes  Here we go! 
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity whoa!!  Swing!  Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo! 
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity WHOA!!!  SWING!!  Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! 

[Wyclef] 
You should've have died before you reach this station, Refugees we run the 
border! 
Ay! Ay!...Ay! Ay! 
You should've have died before you reach this station, Refugees we all go 
murder! 
Now!!! 

[Wyclef] 

Yo!  Now that I escape, selling four million plates 
My beeper vibrates, like California earthquakes 
But I keep a balanced head, 'cause you're hot, they're not 
M.C.'s go Hollywood, then lose their spot on the jukebox 
Still ichi bang, wack M.C.'s get the gong! 
Lyrical tongue 
Wireless mics from Samsung 
Wyclef, seduced once by an actress 
Angela Basset wanted the head of Jean Baptiste 
Meanwhile across town, I steal no money to Carlito 
Mama always say don't gamble 
I'm trapped in casino 
No more money in my bags 
Nightmares, getting closer 
I slept on Elm Street, Freddy Kruger 
Woke up with a German Luger 
Black serial killer, man turns to gorilla 
Provoked I change faces like Michael Jackson's Thriller 
B-B-B-B-B-Boo! Imitating young Michael Jackson 
And you don't stop!!! 

[Chorus 1x] 

[Wyclef] 
Yo, L-Boogie where you at? 

[Lauryn] 
I'm just adjusting my mic 

[Wyclef] 
Come on, yo L-Boogie where you at?! 

[Lauryn] 
I'm just adjusting my mic! 

[Wyclef] 
Yo, L-Boogie where you at? Come on! 

[Lauryn] 
I'm just adjusting my mic! 

[Wyclef] 
Well won't ya, grab the mic and lead the blind to the light?! 

[Lauryn] 
If I could change the times, make rhymes, raise the babies 
Give all the pigs rabies 
Send biting niggas to Haiti's 
Clothe young ladies 
Chase the rainbow, find the pot 
Free the third time offender once he learns to makes-a-lot 
Lose the fame 
Take the money 
Play boys, just like the bunny 
Find a man with a plan 
Slap a chicken, If she acts funny 
Break the bank, on tank 
Stop niggas from acting stank 
Take over your vouch free Rovers 
Teach a man to find Jehovah 
Own the stores, own the tours 
Watch the record, pimps and whores 
Make love, stop the wars 
Cop the land, like the laws 
Make the last be the first 
Make the God respect the Earth 
Change the murder rate to the birth! Swing! 

[Chorus 1x] 

[Wyclef] 
Hey yo, Pras where you at? 

[Prakazrel "Pras"] 
I'm just adjusting my mic 

[Wyclef] 
Yo!  Hey yo, Pras where you at?! 

[Pras] 
I'm just adjusting my mic! 

[Wyclef] 
C-C-Come on, yo Pras where you at?!! 

[Pras] 
I'm just adjusting my mic! 

[Wyclef] 
Well won't ya, grab the mic and make the crowd react! 

[Prakazrel "Pras"] 
No more tours, no more scores 
Por favor senor, I do the soundbite from here to El Salvador 
Ready to take over, Like that! Gun cocks 
Run your whole crew over, Like that!! Gunshot 
Buffalo soldier!  Dreadlock rasta! Lauryn in background 
Rather be slaughtered, than be captured! 
Three refugees, one usual suspect 
Trapped in the firm, 'cause he fell to two techs 
Prospects have thoughts, blood in like outlets 
I can read your whole flow, just like a pamphlet 
Thousands and thousands of watts 
High volt! 
Body as a Q-Tip, right on the asphalt 
Tell the truth that you shouldn't sky off 
This is Mr.  Prakazrel, I don't take it as an insult 
I grab the money, money! 
Stash the cash-n-dash, peddle on the gas 
I'm clear like Everlast! Never seen a refugee movin' so fast! - Salaam 
Now catch me in Jamaica 
Chillin' at the break of sunsplash! 

[Chorus 1x] 

[Lauryn] 
Ooo-wee!    To Queens 
Ooo-wee!    To New Jersey 
Ooo-wee!    To Brooklyn 
Ooo-wee! ...and Uptown 
Ooo-wee! ...and Long Island 
Ooo-wee! ...Staten Island 
Ooo-wee! ...U.C. University of Columbia 
Ooo-wee! ...Miami! 
Ooo-wee! ...To Jamaica!
