[LAURYN:]
Strumming dub plates with our fingers, 
Eliminate sounds with our song, 
Killing a sound boy with this sound, 
Killing a sound boy with this sound, 
Taking sound boys' lives with this dub, killing him softly with this sound. 
Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song, 
Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song. 
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style, 
And so I came to see him and listen for a while. 
And there he was this young bwoy, stranger to my eyes, 
Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
Singing my life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song, telling 
my whole life with 
his words, killing me softly with his song. I felt all flushed with fever, 
embarrassed by the crowd, I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud. 
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on strumming my pain 
with his fingers, singing my life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song, telling my 
whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song

Yo L-Boogie, take it to the bridge 

[LAURYN:]
Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words, 
killing me softly with his song, 
killing me softly with his song, 
telling my whole life with his words, 
killing me softly with his song. 
Strumming my pain with his finger, yeah he was . . . 
shoutouts and fade.
