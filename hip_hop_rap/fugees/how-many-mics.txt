[CHORUS REPEAT 2X:]
How Many Mic's Do We Rip on the Daily 
Say me say Many Moni, Say me say manymanymany 

[LAURYN:]
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme 
Thinking of all the kids who try to do this 
For all the wrong reasons 
Seasons change, mad things rearrange 
But it all stays the same like the love Doctor Strange 
I'm tame like the rapper, 
Get red like a snapper when they do that 
Got your whole block saying"TRUE DAT" 
If only they knew that, 
It was you who was irregular, 
Sold your soul for some secular 
Muzak that's wack, 
Plus you use that loop over and over 
Claiming that you got a new style 
Your attempts are futile, Ooo chile 
Your puerile, 
Brain waves are sterile 
You can't create, you just wait to take, my tape's 
Laced with malice 
Hands get calloused 
From grippin' microphones from here to Dallas 
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me, 
I get Inner Visions like Stevie 
See me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be 
Indeed be like Khalil Muhammad 
MC's make me vomit 
I get controversial 
Freak your style with no rehearsal 
Ooo, contraire mon frere 
Don't you even go there 
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare 
I dare to tear into your ego, 
We go, way back like some ganja and pelequo 
Or Coleco-Vision 
My mind makes incisions in your anatomy 
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy 
Or Leviticus, God made this word 
You can't get with this 
Sweet like licorice, 
Dangerous like syphillis, yeah.

[CLEF:]
I used to be underrated 
Now I take iron, makes my s*** constipated 
I'm more concentrated. 
So on my day off, 
With David Sonnenberg I play golf 
Run through Crown Heights screaming out Mazel Tov 
Problem with no man 
Before black, I'm first human 
Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand 
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under 
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla 
Momma always told me "You're one in a million" 
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians 
Now I got a record deal, "How does it feel" 
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal. 
Cause the whole world's out of order 
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta 
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth 
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guiness Stout 
Brother brother can't you get this through your head 
It's a set up by the fed's they're scoping us with their Infra-reds. 

[CHORUS REPEAT 3X:]
How Many Mic's Do We Rip on the Daily 
Say Me Say Many Moni Say me say manymanymany 

[PRAZ:]
Too many MC's not enough Mic's 
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike 
Dice and dynamite like Dolomite 
Double deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke 
Startlight to starbrite the freaks come out at night 
Like my man Wyclef I wear my sunglasses at night 
And my panache will mosh your entourage 
Squash your squad and hide your body under my garage. 
And when the cops come lookin' 
I'll be bookin' to Brooklyn 
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken 
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin 
Drivin' in my fast car playin' Tracy Chapman
