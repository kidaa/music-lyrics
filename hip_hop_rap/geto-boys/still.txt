Scarface Still.....kill..  X2
Willie D
Back up in your ass with the Reurection
Is the group harder than an erection
That shows more affection
They wanna ban us on Capital Hill
Cause its die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas 
Bushwick Bill
All along [still] it was the geto, nothing but the geto
Takin short steps one foot at a time and keep my head low
And never let go
cause if I let go, then I'll be spineless
I'm goin' INSANE!
Scarface
I think my mind just goes outta control
And judge your subjects muthafuckas read about
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
I seen this muthafucka's .9 smokin'
I seen the same nigga with the .9 die with his eyes open
And simply what this means is
He didn't know that every dog had his day
Until he seen his
I bet you muthafuckas will too
Because its die muthafucka, die muthafucka still fool
chorus X4
Scarface Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool 
Willie D Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
   [I think it's something in the water man, it's just
    gotta be in the water]
Bushwick Bill
Awwww Fuck!  Chuck's on a killing spree again
With guillotines for men
I walk around town with a frown on my face
Fuck the whole world, fixin' to catch a murder case  
The murder rate
Scarface
May increase if your caught up in the world
While it's dyin', I guarentee your fryin' cause I am
On the verge of knockin' muthafuckas out for no reason
Once I get down there'll be no breathin' it seems when
Muthafuckas wanna calm down, put his palm down
Seems I gots to lay the law down
Now its on pow what you to do? I'm askin' you
Willie D
Step to face I'll break your ass in two, bastard you
Rather swim in some fuckin' hot tar
Before you fuck wit Willie D cause what I got for
Your ass will make ya shit your meal
Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Chorus X4
Scarface
How many niggas brought they irons tonight? [Tell me]
How many niggas wanna ride tonight? [I do]
Pick out our victims when the time is right
We get they ass up off the corner cause they dyin' tonight
Willie D
Niggas be all up in my mug
But it's a different story when them muthafuckas coughing up blood
  [When he died, looking in his eyes, was he as he cried]
I bust another cap in his ass and he died, time is 5
Bushwick Bill
Niggas be shootin' the gif like they for real
But when it jumps, they ain't got no murder skills
So Bill just, chops 'em down, watch 'em fall
And cut they ass head to toe, jaw to jaw
Willie D
But I'ma make your bitch ass holla
Cause I'ma put a hole in your head
The size of a half a dolla
  [Fuck around and get your cap peeled cause this is]
Die muthafucka, die muthafucka [kill]
Chorus X4
