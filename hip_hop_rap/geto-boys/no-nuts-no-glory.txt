-Big Mike how you livin
Big Mike
I've been sellin out the same dope house since the age of 16
Shufflin crack like cards, to these burnt out dope fiends
Sellin rock after motherfuckin rock
Seeing cop after motherfuckin cop on the block
Changing face after motherfuckin face
Watchin niggas catch dope case after dope case
Add it up and you'll find more niggas doing time in the pen
Cause he wouldn't snitch on his fuckin friend
And that same motherfucker that didn't go to jail
Couldn't come to pay his homey for his bail
But that's the way niggas do you
Caught a case for another nigga and he sware he never knew ya
12 months in the county you done got out and found out
That your homey runs his own dope house
And he done gave you shit
Not even a funky ass ounce so get on and beat that sheisty bitch
And he still calls you family
But I be damned if i be kin, to a nigga who ain't payin me
Cause I ain't with that hoe shit
So if you thinkin bout fuckin me, nigga you better try some more shit
Cause I done paid my dues and like a fool in the process
Watchin other niggas progress
On the motherfuckin shit I did
But in the 90s', its payback and we ain't takin no shorts kid
Cause life is a bitch
And I ain't that nigga to be broke, while makin another motherfucker rich
Wise up nigga, get with the program
Cause in this dirty game, you gots to wash your own hands
And I got a tech 9
Ready to take mine and what's for me hoe
Yeah, no nuts no glory
Big Mike:
Now I done heard a nigga callin me the biggest bitch in Texas
Cause I'm bumming a ride, when I should be drivin Lexus
But you know, i gives a fuck about what nigga say
I handle mine, by handlin shit my own way
I let niggas thinks its cool
To fuck a nigga like me, but they don't know who they psychin fools
See I stay lo-key
Lettin a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me G
Claiming that we friends
My little girl is ridin the bus, his little girl is drivin a fuckin Benz
Whose your friends?
Ask yourself that shit
The only friend I got, is my fuckin pistol grip
 Filthy rich I know you love it 
I done made your ass fat
And you still talkin bout 25 off a hundred
Be real that shit went out in 86
I'm down with the Geto Boys but my mind ain't playin tricks bitch
You still refuse to give me mine cool
Nigga be that way and I'm gone handle my business fool
Just like my nigga Snoop Dogg told me
You gotta be down for your shit, why you can homey
Cause you's about to get your ass lit up
Because the fuckin ain't proper and I ain't the nigga that's catchin the
nut
Payback is a motherfucker
Payback is a bitch
But payback is a must when I ain't the nigga that's gettin rich
Cause life ain't but one big change
And unlike these other motherfuckers
I ain't afraid to touch yo bitch ass
Cause if you believe in fuckin niggas, you's a hoe
And the Peter man can't tolerate hoes so you gots to go
Mr. big man, Mr. big nut
Got everybody thinkin you the shit
But really I'm the motherfuckin one
Now I'm about to grab my shit off the self
And go on a mission, one nigga gettin bad by his damnself
So keep on thinkin you fuckin me
But while you thinkin, I'll be pullin yo fuckin number g
Cause I'm a nigga with no heart and no worry
Gettin down for mine's bitch
No nuts no glory
