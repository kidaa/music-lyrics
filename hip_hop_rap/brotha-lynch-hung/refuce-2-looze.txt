Hour follows hour
Like water follows water
Everything is governed by the rule
Of one thing leads to another
You can't really place blame
Cuz blame is much to messy
Some was bound to get on you
While you were tryin to put it on me

Don't fool yourself
Into thinking things are simple
Nobody's lying still the stories don't line up
Why do you try to hold on
To what you'll never get a hold on
You wouldn't try to put the ocean
In a paper cup

Cuz I have had something to prove
As long as I know there's something
That needs improvment
And you know that every time I move
I make a woman's movement
And first you decide
What you've gotta do
Then you go out and do it
And maybe the most we can do
Then you go out and do it
And maybe the most we can do
Is just to see eachother through it

Hour follows hour like water in a river
And from one to the next we don't know
What each hour will deliver
We just call it like we see it
Call it out loud as we can
And then afterwards we call it all water
Over the dam

Maybe the moral high ground
Isn't as high as it seems
Maybe we are both good people
Who've done some bad things
I just hope it was okay
I know it wasn't perfect
I hope in the end we can laugh
And say it was all worth it

Cuz I have had something to prove
As long as I know something
That needs improvement
And you know that everytime I move
I make a woman's movement
And first you decide what you've gotta do
Then you go out and do it
And maybe the most that we can do
Is just to see eachother through it

We make our own gravity
To give weight to things
Then things fall and they break
And gravity sings
We can only hold so much is what I figure
We try and keep our eye on the big picture
And the picture keeps getting bigger

Too much is how I love you
But too well is how I know you
And I've got nothing to prove this time
Just something to show you
I guess I just wanted you to see
That it was all worth it to me
