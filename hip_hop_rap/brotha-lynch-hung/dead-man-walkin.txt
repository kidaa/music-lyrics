Don't let 'em get to your heart

Don't lose your diamonds swimmin' in a lake when it's only God

The whole wide world feels like a shrine built to the worker bees

Who stole it from God anyhow

Lay it down child Lay it down child And walk into this room

Don't let 'em get to your spark

That little light in the back of everything that says this

Isn't for madder love

The whole wide world feels like a clan

of mad scientists removing the juice

So they can freeze-dry you and put you in a box

Lay it down child

Lay it down child

And walk into this room all made with love for you

Lay it down child

You can

You can

Lay it down child

And walk into this room

A hundred candles to make the walls come alive

A little frank insence to sweeten the air just right

Now take my hand

And open the door

And open the door

Lay it down child

You can

You can

Lay it down child

And walk into this room

Walk into this room

Lay it down child

Just lay it down, lay it down

Lay it down

Lay it down, lay it down

Into this room
