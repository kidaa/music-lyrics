Louris
the wheels are spinning inside of my head
the wheels are spinning inside of my head
they don't know, they don't know
the leaves listen to what I say
the leaves listen to what I say
they don't know, they don't know
it's a stab in the dark
the light slept on the riverbed
the light slept on the riverbed
slipped into the shadows
and landed like a figurehead
the moral night is the darkest night
the moral night is the darkest night
they don't know, they don't know
I cut my feet on the white shell road
I cut my feet on the white shell road
they don't know, they don't know
it's a stab in the dark
the light slept on the riverbed
the light slept on the riverbed
slipped into the shadows
and landed like a figurehead
then I saw her running
down, down in the garden
her hair was flowing round and brown
tumbled and stumbled to the ground and died
the leaves listen to what I say
the leaves listen to what I say
they don't know, they don't know
I cut my feet on the white shell road
I cut my feet on the white shell road
they don't know, they don't know
it's a stab in the dark
the light slept on the riverbed
the light slept on the riverbed
slipped into the shadows
and landed like a figurehead
they don't know ...
it's a stab in the dark
