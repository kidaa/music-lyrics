Well I get up and the sun goes around
So rundown but I head into town
Taking a chance and I started to dance
What I need is a new romance
Step back chicken shack homicidal maniac
That chick's outta whack dancin' with a broken back
Making a move as I head on out
Being a man makes me jump and shout

Father son and the holy ghost
They're three guys that I like the most
Everybody say a prayer each day
A word for Jesus lights the way

Hey little Pete what you go and do
I should have knocked some sense into you
Came in swingin' and you went out hidin'
Twenty four hours of horse back ridin'
Well this is just a make believe world
One two three kick one two three jump
There's one thing I'll always remember
I'll love you much more than just a pretender

Father son and the holy ghost
They're three guys that I like the most
Everybody say a prayer each day
A word for Jesus lights the way

Everybody's got a secret they made
Everybody's got a skeleton closet
There's just one person that's got the key
Well if you wanna have some fun
Come along with me yeah

Well shine on harvest moon shine on brightest stars
I ain't had no visitors lately from Jupiter or Mars
I had a dream it's about you
I had a dream that always comes true
When I die I wouldn't hide
I'd happily ride to the other side

Father son and the holy ghost
They're three guys that I like the most
Everybody say a prayer each day
That oughta keep the devil away

Father son and the holy ghost
They're three guys that I like the most
Everybody say a prayer each day
A word for Jesus lights the way

Father son and the holy ghost
They're three guys that I like the most
Everybody say a prayer each day
A word for Jesus lights the way
