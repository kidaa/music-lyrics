-W.Leverty-C.Snare-C.Ellis-M.Foster-

You're headed for the spotlight, I know you can go far
You can do anything just follow your heart
Just set the wheels in motion, hold tight and stake your claim
Make sure that they will all remember your name

Can't you feel it? Comin' on, just let go
Can't you see that you're about to steal the show

Chorus:
Oh You're the overnight sensation
You can be a star
Overnight sensation
No matter who you are

The stage is ready for you, can't wait another day
There is no limit you can take it all the way
Just take your chance forever, and make your dreams come true
You know it's now or never, it's up to you

Can't you feel it? Comin' on, just let go
Can't you see that you're about to steal the show

Chorus
