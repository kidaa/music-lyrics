Now that there's you
I can get up in the morning
Look down the lonesome road
Know that I have the strength to carry on
Now that there's you
Love abides in my soul
I have a purpose, I have a goal
I can reach out and touch the star
Yesterday it seemed so far
Now that there's you, oh you

No matter the trial
I'll get by 'coz I know there's an answer
Somewhere in your smile
Now that there's you

I can reach that mountain top
'Till I get there I won't stop
I've a new sense of pride
It makes me do things I never tried
Now that there's you oh, you

I can feel I am real
At last I taste the honey
I'm alive for the first time
And the sun shines over
Now that there's you
Hey, you

Oh oh oh oh

I see all the colours the world was supposed to be
And now a robin sings and I know there's spring
Now that there's you
Every day I seem to find a new dimension of my mind
I'm no longer a piece of clay
My heart has some buried lungs to say
Now that there's you, oh you

I can feel I am real
At last I taste the honey
I'm alive for the first time
And the sun shines over
Now that there's you

Thank you baby
I feel I am real
At last I taste the honey
I'm alive for the first time
And the sun shines over
Now that there's you

I'm real I'm real
At last I taste the honey
I'm alive for the first time
And the sun shines over
Now that there's you

La la la la la
La la la la la la la
I'm alive for the first time
And the sun shines over
Now that there's you

I'm real I'm real
At last I taste the honey
I'm alive for the first time
And the sun shines over
Now that there's you
