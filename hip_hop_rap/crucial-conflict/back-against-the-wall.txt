Y'all motherfuckers don't want to do none [x2]

In the light never see a nigga like me, things collide inside 
Open your eyes wide and see
Don't want none of G-A-D-E and Conflict
Load em' up and bust a 
Vietnam, we droppin' bomb shit, strapped do draw
Ready to brawl, back against the wall, us against all y'all

I'm ready to brawl at all times, 
don't give a fuck who I'm up against
As long as I can take everyone in my circle
If you really wanna know, nigga most peronal
My reason for treason is bread, so even when I said I love my gauge
Watch the rage that I pull, finna' unleash this cage
I'm comin' out with full intentions, 
be takin' these niggas to other levels
Bringing drama like Physco, going through cycles
Every trip that I take be suicidal living like Waco
So I'm down to ride, down to do whatever, whenever, the weather
Look I could not really care, on another page, through the blaze
I'm 'a get at em'

Nasty, come and get mashed
You wanna up gats, you'd better be strapped
Ain't got time to change em' my my mind is finally made up
Thinking just fuck em' all up
Pop with the glock, on spot, if it's hot, I got a two-shotter pump
Just to get a nigga bumped and put up in the trunk
If you wanna get tough enough, you get bucked, blast
Put him on down and out, wildin' out done got you shot
Should have been down to put a rock in your sock
But your sock got a whole, and I'm on cocked
Back with the sack in the rodeo pack
Get back, I make a nigga get slapped in the face with the gate
I'm 'a let the cult demonstrate
The conflict gettin' crucial when the raw be killing em'

Come thirsty nigga
Punks be denied, ready to ride,willing to die, feeling me now
Nigga get the right act in your mind
Nigga get the acts back in a row right
Act that jaw, to the right axe saw
Ain't no thang bigger, and I'm a' back em' all
Temptations trump tall, upskirts
Let em' deal with the hurt, quick fast ways

Take that motherfucker, it's Wildstyle
Take your weak ass niggas along, fuck Bone
Dissin' my home, sayin' we clone
If your ass want to battle, boy I'll take it to the chrome
That's right, my city gonna ride with the Flic', die with the Flic'
What you wanna get on, what's up
Cut the bullshit, get em' with the bidness
There's gangbanging in my blood, no love
Get slugged, body drug through the mud, bring it on let's thug
Cause we comin', straight young gunnin', catching niggas running
Y'all motherfuckers don't want to do none

Bone killer, killer to the bone, I got that home address
Y'all niggas better leave it alone, this Raw Dope life or death

[hook]

Any time or place let's go, down for the cause, strapped to draw
Ready to brawl, back against the wall, us against all
Y'all motherfuckers don't want to do none [x2]

Let's get bucked til' this bitch catch fire
Look a' here, we the rodeo riders, crucial colliders, crucial killers
 fighters, wild west-siders
You can't have the truth, the truth like liars
It's on tonight, so know
We having fun making highways on your crossroads, overload
The fuck E coming back in the form of the Messiah, tight like pliers
Cutting perfect wires, hide like Mayans
The reason they singing the blues is cause these niggas need to retire
More of a musical wiser
So I advise you to get up and be done
Give me the bone, those motherfucking niggas really don't want none

Pop for the Wild-Wild, feel the buck, cook em' up pow-pow
Give it up for the Chi town, nigga watch out, get knocked out the box
Roll with the top-notch heat pop pop
For the plot and we dropping em'
Unstoppable, cocking em', leaving em' dead
When they lay in the land of the raw, 
nigga what you seen, what you saw
The nigga 4 deuce stack em' all

Bringing the C-O-N-Flict team from R-E-N-E-G-A-D-E's
Got four others now and take everything you own
Now as serious as I am, why am I so serious now
Cause it's been no time for games playing around wastin' your life
Quit talking crap and pullin'
Pussy gonna get you killed if you don't use it 
Got go-getters, plenty missles, stop em' drop em' and I'm wishing
Who that fucking with your eyes
Got you blind to the fact that it's us against all, back to the wall
Violent lessons jumping off unless you all to the raw

It's the bull and the rope and I'm making you choke
Travel the world with us people and folk
Tell us go watch everywhere that we go
But we still keeping it dope yo'
Niggas just bark for some Kibbles and Bits
Niggas don't know about this lyrical shit
Life or death, Renegades, Realer and Flic'
Coming through your town and killing your clique

[hook]

I'm a hit a nigga up so truly gooly, he wouldn't understand it
Recognize me in this shit as a chief I said
And run up to me with your shit, go on and do it, cause I would
Fuck this motherfucking status shit, I'm bringing the goods
And tempting their manhoods, to think they could even fuck with me
Call me Coldhard , busting shit from 'cross the street nigga
Throw all my cards to box with 'em
Cars are still deep but your sound was still illing
What the fuck, you niggas think I'm chilling cause I'm calmed and cool
So perhaps I'll bust on one of you stupid ass niggas for being a fool
Stroll through, I'm heated
Them gats combusting rapid at your whole crew
Get called for disaster cause we strapped and let the dogs loose
Hit the main man with the deuce, for the high tech shit fucked up
With Flic' now its on with you, you scared,  out your  in bed
Sissy ass nigga we really ain't done shooting the lead
Split your cabbage to the red for fucking with us
Now we sick in the head nigga

By all means, it really don't stop, stay out the dark
Keep messing get marked
Face to face I'm 'a check them phonies
That don't want none trying to diss my homies
Roll and rocker creeping through your city
Bone crusher when I slap you silly
Bone rusher when my mac milli catch a toe tag for touching my billi

Who the fuck want some drama, I'm a' slice 'em up, dice 'em up 
I'm 'a cut their head off then neck
I'm feel like I spent twenty years down in Tibet
Rumbles, give me red ass knuckles, knuckles hit his eye like buckles
Buckles keep 'em spit like Ruffles
Fuck it, like a must we buck it
