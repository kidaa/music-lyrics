Whee-hee-hee-hee!

[Chorus]
Desperado.  Can't help it. I just can't let it ride
wanted dead or alive.
Desperado.  Gunsmoke makes me strive.
Bogus way of life.

Who the hero  Who the villian
When I'm sterrin down the block
fools wanna try why
fly what they ridin'
on the tip of a rider slidin'
somebody gotta die
on the frontier.
Cruisin' but watchin' for a hit
cause the hood be on
shoot em up
everytime I look around
something goin' down buck buck
somebody got popped
stop drop 
hollow point tips hard to dodge
when you lookin' down your enemies barrel
you wish your apparel was camaflouge
booyaw what you gone do now
I got my crew pal
and weese wrangla's
what I got in my chamber
will rearrange ya
goddang ya
will hang ya
death wish wanna play
under lasy under lay
can't help it when I spray
break out if you stay
you're gonna pay in a bogus way
I'll blow your skull hollow
now if you follow
that's your choice and you're
gonna feel sorrow
death hard to swallow
you rodent
here todasy gone tomorrow
shouldn't fuck wit a...

[Chorus]

In the streets it's a game 
niggas try to get a name
but ah,
I don't fuck with em
when I hit em with the shit to make em wanna
squash it,
watch it.
Ride off through the valley
leave em in the alley.
Stankin' bitch who gone trick
no witnesses
I rush the vic
two times in the shit.
I laid em, miss
he was acting like he had something
I got pissed.
No whif.
A nigga said that he was at you
what you gone do
strap up black hoody up and
bit the dust
a hard head make a soft ass,
so I'm gone blast.
Watch a motherfucker last.
Shoot it
don't baby food it
you got something nigga
you'd better use it.
Threatning a nigga with a gun
it aint fun
you caught one.
Three off from the back
gotta blow my guns 
woo-woo
with a glock 
make your ass stop.
Attack again
won't come back again
fuckin' him up like a bitch.
Bustin' at him quick
reachin' for your shit
try to get away from me
you getting hit
you dig.
Better move your kids
I'm at this nigga
and I don't wanna do it,
but I'm wanted 
so fuck it
I'm ready to drop em
shit
I got em.

[Chorus]

Who can help but to be scandalous
cloned a vandalist
but aint havin' shit.
Boom. Buck. Buck.
Who's next to get fucked up.
Chump
gotta lot of rowdy niggas
wannt get your body stunk.
Steppin' in the middle of a motherfuckin' blizzard
where niggas are livin' and copin'
and rooftop scopin'
at ass
too fast
sufferin' succotash.
Quicker to bust and blast
take em up off the map.
Now you wonder why it's on
it's on,
cause a motherfucker didn't play like that.
Start the shit
the Conflict we attack right away.
To be exact 
now you wanna squash it.
Uh-uh 
it's a rumble
only way we gone end it
when you on your back
kick off and ripped off
til shit aint attached.
Itch through the dirt 
like a bitch bad with crabs.
Yee-Haw, Yee-Haw
Desperado rollin' out
I'm wanted for millions
for hanging up scabs.
Take that
bust off cannon then haul ass.
Bogus way of life.
But life get the last laugh
no chance to glance and dance.
Shit in your pants
your leavin' the land
hit your whole clan
with they guns in they hand.
Mission is finished 
and victory flawless.

[Chorus]

Gunsmoke from the Chi
never with a crew
and it's Flict and die.
Gotta' put em up
put yo hands up right now
clap
I'ma snap
react and serve my pack
or punch a punk dumb
here I come
with the Flict
renegade and raw dope'll split
heads.
Come equip or get rip with
lead
never dis
dat strap so what's next 
we can get down
rumble or tuggle around
what you got
you gotta give it your all right now
pal
or get piled with pow
you foul
we buckwild
get on up you got one false move.
It's Chi for now
we down to change the rules.
Buddy done got his nutty split
sent off a bit
now he got some conflict
got a thousand grams of mac
Wildstylian with Hiddian the Yak.
What else you need to justify trials of the Flict
cause the Flcit'll straight kick it off
somethin' proper dopper know you can't stop a
poppin'.
Steady mobbin' straight up knockin' you noggin.
Tell me what you got, I'm starvin'
bring it on nigga
you trigger happy 
I'ma desperado.

[Chorus]
