I dont know bout y'all man 
but im ready to get my motherfuckin smoke on
I want some of dat green shit, hell yeah, 
Let's burn, all the ghettos, hey wassup kid

[Chorus: Crucial Conflict]

Roll somethin, roll somethin
them niggas aint talkin bout shit

Roll somethin, roll somethin
just cause you just cant hang wit dis
wit dis, wit dis, wit dis

[Verse One: Wildstyle]

Yall niggas aint shit, nothing to fool with, we too swift
giddy up and get down all you niggas aint do shit
one rap down round two chop it off like cool whipwhip
rowdy runnin rodeo can't ride 
fronting in two clips shocking like shocker 
evertime I pop you knock out the box, better move quick flick
comin out of the back in this motherfucker 
yall disgusted bustas cant be trusted for nothing
fucking with this hillbilly wild westside 
C-H-I-T-O-W-N and it's on for life
nothing nice, no ice, you chase 
we fuckin niggas up across the nation
wit no lubracation dick is thick 
and coming at them like Hitler fuck you 
act like you dont hear me then, 
wake up high we in your chin
we embursted with a curse and be worse 
first and kick first now vice-versa
two feet first they kick first and worse 
reimburse the winning cuz I'm first at somethin

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Never]

Put it on your ass motherfucker 
we kill them up bad kill em up bad
Hold that one shit when you fucking with the flick 
you was talking that shit but you couldnt last 
bring to you hoes knockin down your door 
tryin to knock some chunks out yo rump,
at night to the broad daylight 
if you wanna gang fight droppin yall one by one,
coming at them with the quickness with the flickness, 
gonna sign your death wish
cuz you gonna get dealt with, 
slappin you hoes makin sure your eyes closed
take em out by mouth and blindfold 
with the foot on your chest you know the rest nigga 
got us pissed off die for mine, raise up get blazed 
anyways get sprayed your laying in the grave, 
pop em, drop em, re-cock em, 
then squeeze them we deceased to be the defeated, 
repeat em and treat em like read em rights 
I aint finna brag but the man cant hang
with the bogus man
treat like a punk ass trick, 
put a row gonna be closed casket

try to fuck with us we be blasting, smashin

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Coldhard]

Buck buck, pump pump, drop drop,

what da deck run up your debt wit no sweat and we dont regret 
disrespecting your click, 
fuck you bitch, pull out the shit that got yo dangling
picture with a nigga now hangin figure let you big up 
got me strapped in, bust a cap, but I'm warnin ya, dont want none
start shit that you just cant finish, 
be the end, and the family ended
sorry it gotta be this way but I'm sick get a gangsta plate
so now i got a rodeo, one warrant then blow me up, up, up
and away, with my team it aint no thang, 
spoil your dreams, a murder theme
we dont want any crap, I'm bounty clean, 
snatch that hoe and take them dividends
I mean I'm gonna fuck you, what can i do about me Hennessy

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: Kilo]

Come, Come ride her ass and cum and be up

wit a motherfuckin bat, 
who got so scared when soem tellin yo ass nigga

snap off your two nuts right quick

and shit to deal with, roll somethin

[Chorus 2x]
