Use my Body to keep you with mine

Yeah I'm on Durango, number 95.
Take me to the home, take boots and ultralive.
See heaven, that's a horror show.
Knock it nice and smooth step back and watch it blow. Yeaaah...

Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.

Yeah the devil, ride it down the shore.
We'll paint the monster red in soda but don't stain the floor.
In and out, real savage show.
The story of the shocking sickness, and watch it blow. Yeaaahh...

Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Never gonna stop me,
Never gonna stop.
Scream if you want it,
Cause I want it more.
Scream if you want it,
Cause I want it more.
