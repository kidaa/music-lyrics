Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing together, sing violently
Move the jaw cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly 

The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

HEY, YEAH - I'm the one that you wanted
HEY, YEAH - I'm your superbeast
HEY, YEAH - I'm the one that you wanted
HEY, YEAH - I'm your superbeast 

Stir the limbs across the wrist
Full possession of memory
Bury me as a dog
Icy hands surrounding me

The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

HEY, YEAH - I'm the one that you wanted
HEY, YEAH - I'm your superbeast
HEY, YEAH - I'm the one that you wanted
HEY, YEAH - I'm your superbeast 

Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing together, sing violently
Move the jaw cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly

The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

HEY, YEAH - I'm the one that you wanted
HEY, YEAH - I'm your superbeast
HEY, YEAH - I'm the one that you wanted
HEY, YEAH - I'm your superbeast
