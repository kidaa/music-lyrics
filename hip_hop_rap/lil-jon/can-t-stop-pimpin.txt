You ain't in love with me at all
Got ya hand out tryin to get something from big ball
Look I told you I hang with niggaz that pimp hoes
Shakin every trap and collectin from strip shows
I'm a fat playa with a mouth full of gold
I be smokin plenty dro
But I don't put none up my nose
Qualification for any selection I'm makin
Fast talkin, street walkin, non-stop trip breakin
They don't keep nothin dough
They bring it straight to daddy
You catch them stealin dawg
You beat that ass badly
If you not a pimp or broad on the strip
You might not understand this pimpin fallin off my lips
Just don't fake it playa cause it ain't hard to spot
You think you ballin you square like a match box
See I can't help baby

Real hustler have to beat the street and go and get it

Short hair, long hair in them fitted suits
Prada boots and hoes that think they cute
But bitch come short with my cheese
Hoe you ain't seen in me

Cause I'm a breaker man and I'm a pimp you see
And I ain't got time for you chickenhead, tricks you fleas
Cause I P-I-M  to the P 
Pimpin these hoes ain't a thang to me
Been breakin these bitches since '79
Pimpin they ass for them nickles and dimes
And don't give me no excuses
When it come to my money
Cause I'm Nino Brown and you G-Money
And I'm a motherfucker nigga you will never try
Fuck you hoes cause I'm a pimp 'till I die
