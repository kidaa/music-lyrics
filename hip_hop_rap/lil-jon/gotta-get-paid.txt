[Lil' Jon]
There's something I wan't to tell you 
cause I know that a brother got needs tonight 
I ain't trippin on yo pimpin cause that shits tight 
but you gotta pay tonight 
I know you wanna get laid tonight 
but I'm trynna get paid tonight 
we ain't even gotta fuss and fight 
just give me mine 
It's on all night 
I know you wanna get in bed with me 
but you gotta come correctly 
nothin in life is free 
especially not me 
I hope you 
can feel me 
when I say 
pay before you play with me 
wanna taste this 
but its priceless 
it might be sumthin you ain't never done before 
but I'm not yo ordinary hoe 
repeat lines wit stars once
