Rage in the cage
And piss upon the stage
There's only one sure way
To bring the giant down
Defunct the strings
Of cemetary things
With one flat foot
On the devil's wing 

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me 
Living Dead Girl 

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me 
Living Dead Girl 

Raping the geek
And hustling the freak
Like a hunchback juice
On a sentimental noose
Operation filth
They love to love the wealth
Of an SS Whore
Making scary sounds 

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me 
Living Dead Girl 

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me 
Living Dead Girl 

Psyclone Jack
Hallucinating Hack
Thinks Donna Reed
Eats dollar bills
Goldfoot machine
Creates another fiend
So Beautiful,
They make you kill 

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me 
Living Dead Girl 

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me 
Living Dead Girl 

Blood on her skin
Dripping with Sin
Do it again
Living Dead Girl 

Blood on her skin
Dripping with Sin
Do it again
Living Dead Girl
