[Lord Infamous]
Nigga Three Six Mafia burn inside the southern territorial
Leavin' a memorial page in editorial
When ? watch yo back go front ?? Scarecrow
Leave 'em stiff and froze my foes and hit 'em like Rose in China snow
Wanna see the costs of the bosses comin' to toss it
Ain't no losses, ain't no crosses, leave you dead in a closet
Family recked from yo death-death, from yo early death
Packin' some in jars, sendin' two off for the chef
Cause I melt them with medicine
I'm perscription called death when ?

She straight slick
But I'm slicker than that bitch gon' get
So now move bitch, get out the way hoe and lay low
So say hoe, you just another stank hoe
Trickin' on the dance flo'
Lookin' kinda slutty though

And everywhere I go, it's the same old shit
Jumpin' drawz just like a broad, so bitch fuck this now

Nothin but them quick sluts
Something kinda freaky like skinny hoe givin' up
Maybe a nigga'll take the camp
Probably let her ride my lap
Made playaz from the Memphis Tenn, bitch I'm on the map
I'm the kinda nigga bro' push a 450 hoe 
Down the strip, Hennessy I sip on the low-low
Hit me on my ? horn
Can record, make a porn movie 
Don't be choosy with this nigga Juicy
Ready to?

Don't none of you hoes know about this order shit

[DJ Paul]
I might not be the freshest nigga up in the club
But shoulda seen when I walked in the hoes said "What the fuck"
They saw me VIP in the VIP y'all
With these Rollies and the ? they be wonderin' "Who are y'all"
We be steppin' no less than 30 deep and thinkin' we some stars
My enterage spendin' no less than 80 G's on they cars
If I took you to my crib you probably wouldn't believe or think I'm liein'
Check my soundscan hoe, if I'm liein' or dyin'
