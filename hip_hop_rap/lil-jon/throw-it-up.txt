[Pastor Troy]
The last nigga is the pastor
Ready to blast ya

Got the black and red seats with the Georgia tuft
And I got my helmet hangin out the winda
Ready to  bust the head :.of a fucking pretender
Nigga as soon as I enter
You know im making noise

I cock that hoe and let it mother fuckin rip
To sank shit is what I live for

Put some more Yak in my mug
