[Verse - Usher] w/ Lil Jon in background 
Up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I 
Keep it down on the low key low key 
You should know how it feels hey!! hey!! 
I seen shorty she was checking up on me 
From the game she was spitting in my ear 
You would think that she knew me knew me 
I decided to cheat okay!! Conversation got heavy! hey! 
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow! watch out!! 
Oh! watch out!! She's saying "come get me!" come get me 
So I got up and followed her to the floor 
She said "baby let's go" 
When I told her let's go!! I said

[Verse - Ludacris] 
Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous 
In the club looking so conspicuous 
And RAWR!! These women all on the prowl 
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow 
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth! 
I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!! 
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes 
Then "bend over to the front! and touch your toes!!" 
I - left the Jag I took the Rolls 
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrollll oww!! 
How ya like me now? 
When my pinky's baguette over three hundred thou-sand! 
Let's drink, you the one to please 
Ludacris fill cups like double D's 
Me and Ush' once more, and we leaves em dead 
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say.
