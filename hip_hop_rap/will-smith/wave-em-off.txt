From a distance, you can witness the glow from my entourage
Gravitate towards the ambiance
see me & my men on CNN, then the birth of the inevitable hate begin
cause hate is the chld to greatness
the glue between Neo & the Smiths in the matrix, yin to the yang
It just must be, ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP

[B SECTION]
I said stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me
All your negativity might drown me I just try to go hard, doing my job
Stop, get out - the whole world loves me cause I do what I do
& I don't like the energy coming from you Trying to play me soft, wave em off

[CHORUS]

I just wave em off, yeah I ain't concerned with your hatin' that don't slow down my paper makin
wave em off, yeah While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes
wave em off yeah Love me, I paved the way, boys we can't behave this way come on
wave em off, yeahWhile the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes
Coming of age I invaded nations, on stage, I seen Haitian & Asian faces
No vacations just more locations, I go places, so chasing my vocation
So demonstrating the way to be patient with life's test, through my IRS situations
My guess is my dedication don't phase ya, a public sensation, in private you hatin'
Why? That's so last year, that's so not sexy, but I shall not let the hate stress me
I got bigger fish to fry & I could stand on my wallet, probably kiss the sky
When I close my eyes, I wish that I could change how you get pissed when I do things you can't deny
Truth is, Great do need Hate to survive, so I...

[CHORUS]

Block 'em out, ignore 'em wave em off
Don't pay these jokers no mind wave em off
They just all mad cause they in the coat section of the hate train & they can't get off
Still flaming boy, stand clear of the hatin' is the best defense Tryin to exceed excellence
Same way hope comes with fear, yo,
Greatness lives here, then 'hateness' lives here, Trust!

[CHORUS]
