I am the
Man in black
I'm back breakin' the back of the
Random attacker so can the flak
Yo, I'm dangerous
I've been trained to bust when a stranger fussed
Tryin' to endanger us
Praise me y'all
Don't nothin' phaze me y'all
When they see me they gauge be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth
Trust me if somebody rip
Out of the depths of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit
The black shades
The black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black raybans I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black 600 man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hangin' without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again?
Mind ya manners or the black suits running in

Nod ya head come and get down for the black suits baby
Just let it loose up in here go crazy let me see you nod ya head
The way you bouncin' and shakin' I know you feelin' me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me nod ya head

Serleena makin' me sick right?
Earth is worthless to her
She be trippin' like
Threatenin' me and my mens tryin' to get the light
Thinkin' she's superwomen with black cryptonite
Finish up whatever you start son
The best lookin' crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right, play nice, and sing along
Cause Kay is back and he hyped
What?
Bring it on

Takin' contenders and provn' they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
