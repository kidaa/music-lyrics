Willow is a player 
She's got me goin' crazy crazy 
She's got me wrapped around her finger 
She's got me goin' out of my mind playin' all the time 
Willow is a player 
She's got me goin' crazy crazy 
She's got me wrapped around her finger 
She's got me goin' out of my mind playin' all the time 

Everytime I see her can't help but to smile smile smile 
And everytime I touch her touch her she make me feel like a child feel like a child 
She got me locked up 
Got me locked - locked up 
I do just about anything anything to stay on her good side uoh uoh 
And when she want something something from me she won't be denied 
Can't even go shopping shopping without buying her a gift 
Every eye tied to her as she steps out the crib steps out the crib 
She keeps me up all night night on my knees as I pray pray 
Cause I can't sleep till sleep till I know she's okay 
She got me locked up 
Got me locked - locked up

I saw another man hold her 
Just a friendly hello 
I know it was nothing nothing but he took to long to let go i think you better let her go 
Ow
Let my girl girl - girl girl go go 
I try to be tough though so strong 
Sometimes she makes me so mad so mad 
Her eyes like diamonds diamonds make me forget she's so bad she's so bad 
She's my angel angel 
This world she's not of 
Sent from the upstairs upstairs 
Taught me that new kind of love love love love 
I can't tell y'all don't understand what she means in my life the world to me 
What make it so crazy crazy, I met her through my wife 
She got me locked up 
Got me locked - locked up
