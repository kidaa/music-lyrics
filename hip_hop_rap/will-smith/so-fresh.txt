Ladies and Gentleman Ricky D

Well once upon a time
 surely
When people wore pyjamas and went to bed early
There was a little boy tight clou and mic sp
Tried to help lead black folk the right rout
Too late
Negative voices many un 
In prison for unwise choices that he once made 
He might a been
Cops would see inside him
And seeing the good he had within him
Let him out again
no longer before will he fall again
Big willies like Will Smith now call again yo Rick, yo Rick
So check the gift
Everything 
What happen when you stir black folk away from negative
Not to mention check the charts killing em
There will be a  behind the biz mark will and rick

Confronting us December 1999 said
 quot;It's all because of you quot;
 quot;Feeling sad and blue quot;
Say what
 quot;You went away now my Rainy days quot;
 quot;I love you so quot;
 quot;How much you'll never know quot;
 quot;You took your love away from me quot; ah ha ha ha ha ho
 quot;You took your love away from me quot; ah ha ha ha ha ho
 quot;You took your love quot;
