I believe in God 
I believe in Destiny 
Not Destiny in the sense of all of our Exerts being pre-determined 
But Destiny in the Sense of our ability to choose 
Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be 

Yo Yo YoYo 

I was Born to reign 
Point Blank 
My name to be ecthed in stone 
My destiny Pre-ordaned 
Tryin to live richteous 
fightin for life, tis my life 
that's why I liked on my vices 
Tightnin the vices of truth on the roofless 
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless 
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi 
YOu and your boyz tryin to decide, what to write 
but your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged 
young minds gettin gorged Stakes have been altered 
by lick or by weed and then hate gets exaltered 
as art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid 
on the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz, but your like a syringe now proud of your binge. 

Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends 
bought a house up in the hills frontin shouts to the pen 
givin false accounts of your account's amounts 
amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception 
laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish 
From the Terrace I see the fire burnin the streets but I won't shield my eyes to the heat 
Born to reign
