If I approach you correctly and step up to you respectfully
Would you please maam bless me with the next dance
I don't intend to offend you, I only intend to befriend you.
But your willing me, thrilling me, killing me with your
My pants not a chance,
I'm a let you go without saying somethin
A little hotter lambata mama the sort that I'm wantin'
No frontin' if it was illegal for you to be that fine
I'd be McGruff mama takin' a bite out a crime
Literally first it'll be, dancin' with me, 
Then it'll be, dinner with me,
Then it'll be, back to my crib and hold up
I'm about to get ahead of myself, and I'm playin' myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinkin of stuff
I'm sayin' the stuff, my bad, back it up
Let's start with a dance
On good behavior maybe later
Maybe you'll part with your pants
Psyche, joke, walkin a tight rope my foot in my mouth
Look my hope was that you'd dance with me.

She was smilin' I was kinda wilin' thinkin'
I'm dialin' in she gave me the impression
She was getting' my message so I'm testin'
I through it out yeah let me buy you a drink
Cause when I'm by you I think it Would be fly if we link what u think,
She responded with a grin and a glance ,
With my eyes tryin' to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess sexy but modest
The hottest mommy from cuba her beauty was timeless
The other night I seen her dancin' duty was over,
She did a split into a spin and put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over 
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancin'
Mommy can you feel me
Still she said nuthin'
Why she be frontin'
Never seen another mommy move like you, groove like you
I'm sayin' I wanna dance with you

To me when I'm dancin' it's aphrodisiatic
It's automatic that I look in your eyes
To help emphasise 
Some people dance socially, Not emotionally
Closer to me, come on, close as you can be
Can you feel me
Come on mama cut me no slack
Can you feel me
Come on mama forward and back
Can you feel me
Come on mama hard as you can
It's part of the plan 
It happens when you start with the man
On your mark ready set baby let's go
Baby let's flow, baby let go
Baby no no got a lot mo'
Lettin it rip, gimme some of that
Yeah that's it
Sweatin' with me getting' it
Wetter with me
It's better with me ain't it
Other girls that I've date
Have fainted, so take it
Or leave it just the way that
I heat it, I bring it, I swing it
Sooo you like dancin' with me
