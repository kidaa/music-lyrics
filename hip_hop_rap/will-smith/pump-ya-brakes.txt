All this excess stress I can't take it
Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid
Why you gotta be all up in her face kid?
The ABS will get you numbers & the name kid
I mean really, houndin' ol' girl, was that really necessary
See your itinerary is all off
You need to be hauled off
She start flippin', she ain't trippin' it's your loss.
This is a simple case of an anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper
That mighta got you a couple of numbers when you were younger
But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper
Be a gentleman& try to be gentle man
The essence of stimulation mental man
But if your acting like you just got out the kennel man
Put your foot on the pedal & pump

[CHORUS - SNOOP DOGG]

If your girl's in ya face & she's outta place
What you need to tell her is... PUMP YA BRAKES
If you're out with your girls & he's pressin' you hard
What you need to tell him is...PUMP YA BRAKES
Now if you're underage & you're actin' all grown
What you need to do is PUMP YA BRAKES
If you're offended by this record, then you know that's you
What you need to do is...PUMP YA BRAKES
Outside the restaurant Girl sees Boy, Girl likes Boy
Girl meets Boy, Boy doesn't know that Girl thinks he's fly
Boy's a nice guy, so Boy says 'Hi'
Boy's Girlfriend returns from going to park
She sees them together this ignites a spark
Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark
Now this is where the pumpin' of the brakes should start
Girlfriend thinks that something's going on
Girl tells Girlfriend nothings going on
Boy's in the middle of the commotion beginning
Girlfriend's mad cause Boy keeps grinning
Now, why is he grinning but that's beside the point
Girlfriend should chill before they roll up in the joint
Jumping to conclusions gets you no where honey
Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy
Dummy

[SNOOP DOGG VERSE:]
Rule #1, is just like #2 the who do's and what nots & what you should dizz-oo
No loud talking, no back talking, If you do either, believe it, you're
back walking
I hate to sound rude but then again, I have to
My rap thang and my mack game, It'll smack you , click clack you, spit at you
I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I got to
I got a question to ask you, would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let em
smash you
If I was you & you was I, would you keep it G or would you stay fly
If you was rich in a ditch, living low, would you push the button,
Keep it cuttin' or would you just let it go
Calm down little homey & know what your dealing with before you run up on me

[CHORUS]
