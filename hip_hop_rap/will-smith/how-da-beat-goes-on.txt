Back again but with a couple of friends 
Thought my reign would end well now Im rubbin it in 
Im back yes yes yallin

Out for a couple of years thought I had fallen 
You seen me with denzel and russ crowe 
But yo the movies just a chick on the side Im in love with the flow 
Time off to be an oscar nominee now 
Back to the M-I-C to emcee now 
Rockin the ol heads blazing the youth 
Only rapper had the president raising the roof 
Check the tape checkmate 
Its one mission 
Make your move 
Dont fight submission 
To dawn to dusk

Just dont miss the bus 
To jam on with us

A hip hop superhero 
A ?? 
Cape or a suit 
Hit the studio 
Every year or so 
And escape with the loot 
On my down time straight to the links 
I could pack a dance floor a movie theatre or truck from ?? 
On Christmas - mom and wife douse em with ice 
Aol - search will smith thousands of sites 
And at the club- hands clappin toes tappin 
Sucka im the greatest thing ever happen to rapping in ali voice 
Best shape of my life destined to show ya 
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total 
Free dont move hip hop mogul 
Philly aint happy I 
I be the guy to go 
The guy to go 
You know the go to go 
The mega man that got the whole crew like 
Damn will done did it again 
He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again 
Yo get them hands up 
Throw your hands up 
Wave em like you dont care 
You like the sound 
Then let me hear you say 

If it's all nite 
and it's alright 
in the sunlight 
This is how da beat goes on 
Big Will 
Tra- Knox 
So hot 
This is how da beat goes on 
Poppin
Rockin n 
Stompin

Big Will
