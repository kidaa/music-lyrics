Yo get your hands off me 
Stop tryin' to hold me down 
Let me just move around 
Girl somethin' done happened to me 
Swear to God somethin' done snapped in me 
I need the whole floor for us 
I'm about to bust mommy and it's glorious 
I can't seem to stop my feet 
You hear my heart beat 
Digga digga digga digga digga digga digga 
Oh lord I'm about to pass out 
But when the night is over I'm a be the last out 
Sweat pourin' in my eyes vision blurry 
Even though my eyes is closed a see visions of her 
Uma siente mami in me coca 
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca 
Heart jumpin' and pumpin' it's about to pop 
But don't tell me nothin' back up

The way you press against me 
You messin' with me 
The way that dress is fittin' has got to be forbidden 
No reason for sercurity I'm feeling secure 
You guardin' my body baby come on and give me some more 
If all these people wasn't in here flocking around I'd have you in the middle of the floor baby knockin' you down 
They'd be talkin' about me when they walk in the house like hammers click click click gizza gizza gizza 
A damn shame how you do the damn thing 
Girl you off the damn chain 
But you're about to be tamed 
Look at ya 
Laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin' 
It wasn't my intention but you got be bridging my linen come on 
Call the doctor get me a respirator 
Look into my eyes mom the pressure is rapidly rising 
Arm around my neck and leg all around my theigh 
I feel like X you be gettin' me next and you be gettin' me high 
Dancin' honey that's how I like to play 
I'll be Patrick Swayze you be Jennifer Grey 
High heel stelleto sexy straight out the ghetto 
She fire 
It's like I'm dancin' with the devil's tail 
Uma siente mami in me coca 
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca 
Heart jumpin' and pumpin' it's about to pop 
But don't tell me nothin' back up

Yo it's like a dream or a TV show a cinema scene 
Brotha only dancin' lombada people treatin' me mean 
Why they be flippin' and trippin' and chasin' me down? 
Rippin' on me racin' around disgracin' the sound 
Got me on the run 
Runnin' for havin' fun 
The way they come and attackin' they act like I had a gun 
Cops give me room 
Stop tryin' to give me doom 
They got me like mararararararara mmmmmrrrrrrrmmmmmmmm 
I don't care who it is 
I ain't stoppin' for helecopters I ain't no fugitive 
Bonny and Clide alive it's me and my shorty 
Get in front of me I don't wanna hurt nobody 
Uma siente mami in me coca 
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca 
Heart pumpin' and jumpin' it's about to pop 
Suckers don't you come no closer back up
