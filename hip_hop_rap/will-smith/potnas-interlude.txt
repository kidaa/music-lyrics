Interlude

So dad, like did you like have real good friends and potnas when you was growing up
Will's dad: I had two real good friends all the way through high school
Who you had
Thomas Jones and Jacob Curtis Jones
Were they like brothers
Well they weren't brothers they just had the same last name as Jones
And everybody thought that I was a Jones too but I wasn't, of course I was a Smith
Right
But they thought I was a Jones, they called us the Jones boys we were so tight
Matter of fact I had a call from one of them
Hey Dad listen, check this record out

It was a dark night
I had just sparked the mic
Brought the light
To the crowd 
In Hampton
It was amped when
I finished with 
Brand New Funk
They were screaming out,  quot;Do Summertime quot;
Some of them was drunk, some of the time
I like to chill after the show
But tonight, yo I wanna get ill after the show
And there she is
5 sumthin, short hair, damn she live
The girls get thicker further down 95
I expressed to her
Sought of confessed to her
I wanted to get next to her
So I suggested to her
We roll
To suite 110
Sweet ones in
My room
Jeff in one eleven with a friend
Then boom boom boom who that open the door
Why they do that
Threw back
By the noise
Some dude and his boys
You know them
Your boyfriend
More like an annoyed friend
Peep through the peep hole peeped him and all his people
That's when Charlie creep through
Boy you wanna see who
Don't nobody wanna meet you
Damn here come the beef stew
My beef ain't with you uh ah
My beef's with Will
So see Mack
Ease back
'fore your cat get peeled
Charlie said,  quot;Any beef with Will is
Plenty beef with me and
Whenever Charlie get mad 
He step to the streets he see
The end of the story
You wonder who survived
Get my  quot;He's the DJ quot; album check track five
