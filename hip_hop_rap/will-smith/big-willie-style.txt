this one goes out to all the big willies

Verse 1: Will Smith

big Will the high roller
strolling through with an entoruage
hard to camaflouge when you livin' this large
I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage
out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down the fifteen
my whole auroa gleamin'
who that kid in the green v
envy brother schemin'
I ain't thinkin' bout them
racing chicks in the pink b.m.
with my speakers tweakin'
freakin' off this weekend
in Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
money can't break us but the places it can take us
big will in the limelight rhyme tight
and we gon' have some fun tonight


Chorus: Will Smith
now how we do it
you know it's Big Willie style baby
now how we doin' it
you know it's Big Willie style
repeat


Verse 2: Will Smith 

I'm in a five star casino shuttin' crap tables down boom
non bettin' willie watchers standin' around
strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us
how bad they wanna be us parlay
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
people stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar
a round for everybody with these big willie cards
from civllians to stars they wanna know who we are
it's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar 
carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit


Chorus


Verse 3: Left Eye

It's Left Eye with a tight crew
representin' like it's ladies night
comin' right through
don't be spiteful
plus an eyeful 
sportin' hot pink
rocks in the link
in the drop with a mink
like my ------ don't stink
got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm
blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
the main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passin'
breakin' you down like fractions
while we be rappin' about things that really happen
big willie style Philly style let's make it happen
with mademouselle from gezals to versace
with a sweet smell
this female leadin' the posse
got jokes like Cosby
in the lots where the cars be
with no apologies it's Left Eye
big Will let the champagne spill
is it a mans thing for real
can us girls roll wit yall
what the deal


Chorus

Verse 4: Will Smith
well now it's lookin' like a car show
convoys and whips on the strip
pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick
for real
big Will household name
entertainer
gold handle cane and matchin' gators
swervin' lane
in pole position rolling deep like a co-malition
in soul poisition and can rock a whole convention
movie screens to the club scene
my whole crew lookin' clean
shine with a diamond gleam
step above where the players be
don't hate me
one is where they rate me
lately you could find me
behind the door marked V.I.P.
eating grapes under the A.C.
big willie style is how we do it

Chorus
