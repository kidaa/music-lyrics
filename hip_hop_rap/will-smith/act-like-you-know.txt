Uh
Big Will and Tra-Knox 
Yo yo yo yo jump 
When I tell you make your way up to the front 
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what you want 
The don jiggy catering to what your feeling 
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling 
Shake
What ya momma gave you baby don't let nothin' break 
Yo watch cause we don't care how much time it's gonna take 
Dance floor packed and it's lookin' like a lake 
It's obduction here's your instructions 
Slide
Get up off that wall girl stop tryin' to hide 
Trackin' afrodesiac won't be denied 
Chill with that cigarette take it outside 
Messin' with my vibe 
I don't like that 
Bounce
I'm a press your player when it counts 
Party like a lamb and a wolf about to pounce 
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling 
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling 

Bring it on the nothing 
Ain't no time for fun things come on 
Just let it flow jump on 
Act like you know 
The only floor is jumpin' 
Ooh these girls are somethin' come on 
Just let it flow jump on 
Act like you know 

I-I-I-I called Jazzy Jeff on the phone 
I said, "I'm downstairs waitin' Jeff come on" 
I told him there's this hot spot we gotta burn 
He said, "Man after last weekend haven't you learned?" 
Yo look here last week was a mistake 
That mommy tryin' to dish out what she couldn't take 
Come back me dancin' like wow like this thing is a game 
One little move on her and she bust into flames whoosh 
The whole club runnin' tryin' to ruin my night 
I told her roll around little she'll be alright 
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face 
Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place 
You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya 
And hopefully your burnt guci dress will remind ya 
Of how serious I am maybe it's crazy y'all 
But if you wanna play hunny go get a baby doll 
Holla at me 

Bring it on the nothing 
Ain't no time for fun things come on 
Just let it flow jump on 
Act like you know 
The only floor is jumpin' 
Ooh these girls are somethin' come on 
Just let it flow jump on 
Act like you know 

Uh uh huh 
Check and make sure I'm lookin' cute for huh 
Check and make sure I'm packin' lute for huh 
Cause I'm about to shut down the bar for huh 
And later open up my car door for huh 
7 PM I leave the set and then 
No more actin' back to rappin' again 
Red carpet hectic gettin' me in 
What happened last week sure it could happen again 
Mos def full funk when ya lookin' at the front lookin' like a jet magazine beauty of the month 
Shades low layin' liggy low on the cut 
Told myself you're the one to shake it up with 
Bounce
Over to your table can get me on announce 
Observe the curves body fat about an ounce 
Hormones pumpin' out dangerous amounts 
Grabbed ya arm turn around girl 
Jump
Move when I tell ya make your move up to the front 
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what ya want 
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling 
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling 
Come on

Ain't no time for fun things come on
