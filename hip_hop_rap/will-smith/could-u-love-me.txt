Yo, Big Will in the place to be, mic check...mic check..
Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town
Would you love me if my pants was hand me downs, huh?
Yo, yo,
Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out & about
8 to 80, all walks of life be shouting it out
Usually, when its time for a encore I hear it
Or when I did something hot, evoking the spirit
It's weird, its like a double edge sword when ya'll applaud
It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile
How do I respond to the phrase, "I love you Will!"?
Kinda heavy when I hear it, I'd be like damn for real?
In a way it makes me wanna stay strong and moral
But history say I could be gone tomorrow
& though my future looks floral
I feel like I'm hoping for much pain
When people stop shouting my name
& doubting my game & liking others better than me
Writing letters to him instead of to me
A veteran 'B', I know the game, but do me this here,
In your heart be clear before you bless my ear
Come on..

[CHORUS]

Could you love me if I lived in a shanty town
Could you love me if my pants was hanging down
Could you love me if my wrist ain't bling
If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted
Would my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if wrist ain't bling
If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?
I pray before I sit with a pen & a pad
A birth of a thought occurs & it calls me Dad
To the universe an idea released from me
Just a CD, nah man, a piece of me
What you can't see is when you be dancing 'B'
Is I asked you a question, that's how you answer me
So when you don't dance, it be like I'm choking from cancer
Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive
Sure, I rationalize like, oh, I see..
But if you don't like my cut, its like you don't like me
Some stuff works, some works not so well
Its like you work so hard, still get hurt like hell
Yo, it could tear you apart
But don't let your wins go to your heard
Your losses go to your heart
& if we ever get the pleasure to meet
Be clever with it, measure what you yell in the street
Come on...

[CHORUS]

Whoo, would you.....
Whoo, could you.....

[CHORUS]
