Darkchild, Big Will, 2000
Bust out, shake it up now
Come on, come on
Shake it up now
Who am I
You know, you know
Big Will, ya ready
Come on

[Will Smith]
When I was a lad I used to dream that one day
I'd earned the cream that 
Make the rocks gleam Phat rhymes to make it seem that
I was like Bill Gates
Writing lies, seal fates
Power to change the whole set
Force foes to forfeit
Then with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence
Envisioned a hot life, hot wife
Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas
With lights in my trees for the ambience
I been up and down and high and low
Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo
My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley
It's something that my fam put in me
Who am I You ask
The guy with the razzamatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz
In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life And the wounds
Stitched up by my wife
Who am I
It's suffice to say found gold in my heart
Put the ice away
Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay
Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day
Who am I
That brother with the platinum plaque
With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack
The fact is that whenever I rap or act
Pole position, front of the pack
Who am I

[Tatyana Ali]
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I

Baby if you really wanna know about me about me
I'll tell you who I am I'll tell you I be I be
Not the one for games
But if you're right with me Oh Yeah
I know I'll do the same

I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I
L-Y-T-E

[MC Lyte]
Who am I
You dare to ask
The same female that hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass
I'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream
Break the bank papi cause we coming for the cream
And while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe not one
Hold paps, sell a million and you still won't equate
So who am I It ain't hard to tell
Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell
See a lot know my face but a few know me well
Just who I am is the one to make you gel
Who am I The chick that keeps spittin'
Taking back all my snip that was bitten
Rewritten dangerous laison
With the shades on
Making sure the track stays on
Days on end I be that one true friend
That will always be around when the world falls down
I'm honest to the bone
No question, suggest
You don't wanna know
I give the truth, nothing less than
I'm sweet with a heart to fit
Smart as a whip
You feed me well but I'm still hard to get
I'm like a calculus problem you just can't solve
Study me well if you wanna get involved
And even after that I'm still unpredictable
Now who am I I'm unforgettable

[Tatyana Ali]
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it you might hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I
I be fully educated yes I am
Not the one to play with No No
And I find that some of y'all hate it who am I
But you wanna know baby
Who am I who I am
Tatyana Ali, L-Y-T-E, Big Will for the Will 2k, one time no doubt
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I
