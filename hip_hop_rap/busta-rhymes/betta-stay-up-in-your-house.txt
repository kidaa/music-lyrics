Busta
Yea, I know it's kinda cold outside 
Bring your nasty ass inside 
And you should know better
Play yourself a dark corner motherfucker, yea
Brother, you know you're wrong

Come on, can't stop, won't stop, rockin' for you niggas
'Cause I rep the street and Johnnie Cochran for you niggas
And I, got a state gun cockin' for you niggas 
twenty-one legal gun shots 

Digga
Poppin' for you niggas, 
And I, blow tones, more force than cyclones 
Shit is on everytime I catch a Ron Jones
Thug bitch, rock boots and hoops with rhinestones
Got the key to the city and run the crime zone

Busta
Now come on, take something, shake something, break something 
Stop, close your shop, you niggas ain't sayin' nothin' 
Niggas be frontin' and knowin' they ain't really weighin' nothin'
Betta stop 'fore we pop and really get to sprayin' something

Busta
Flood it up
Digga
Whip it up
Busta
Smoke it up
Digga
Blooded up, 
Niggas straight tryin' to brake, I tell 'em shut it up, 
I spit the ill for real, ain't nothin' buttered up, 
Flipmode doin' it everybody love it up

Chorus
East coast, what up? West coast, what up?
Midwest, what up? Dirty South, what up?
All my chickenheads, put it in your mouth,
It's Flipmode, better stay up in your house
All my thugs, what up? Thug bitches, what up?
Street niggas, what up? Stack riches, no doubt
We got the block locked take another route,
It's Flipmode, better stay up in your house
My niggas HOOK

Digga
Dirtiest, wordiest, Jersey it's wetter than a mile
I stalk like pedophiles, no body get's saved when I bless the child 
Gettin' eight like snapper you too fessed to vow

Busta
Hold up
Digga
Run On
Busta
Get Up
Digga 
Come On

Busta
Ahhooo!
And put every single nigga where I'm from on
Bitches all in the spot go head and get your fun on
Niggas keepin' it movin' go head and get your thug on

Digga
What on earth possesed y'all to try a lil' drunk lil' high
Big heads in the sky make niggas straight cry
Without Mo' and Dry, take it down homeboy got bigger fish to fry
Fuck that Other nigga Rush that sucker nigga 

Busta
Niggas love the way we sound up on another Digga
Hot D but I got another younger brother bigger,
Digga pass me the Henny so I can take another swigger

Chorus

Digga
Switch it up like Ak-Nel
Why you hit a dry spell, 
Cats like you get no reply on the Skytel
Hate y'all Raps like Eminem hate Britney
Bonafide MC Who fuckin' with me?

Busta
Top niggas better give props nigga 
'Fore you get dropped fuck around and get your shit popped nigga,
Flip-flop niggas, you could really get your shit mopped 
Or left to lay up in a pit stop nigga

Digga
Spillin' it
Busta
Feelin' it
Digga
Killin' it
Busta
Come on!

Digga 
The hardest MC don't want flex no more,
Make it hot everytime I rock, rest assured 
Shit'll have that who could rock the raw best award, nigga

Busta
Look it up
Digga
Cook it up
Busta
Shook it up
Digga
Book it up

Busta
When we rock you shouldn't watch promoters nook it up
Raise the level a little you know my niggas took it up
In and outta big figgas while me and Digga cook it up

Chorus
