Pussycat Dolls
Ya see this shit get hot
Everytime I come through when I step up in the spot are you ready
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick
Yes I'm on the lookout lets dance
Slow bangin shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it oh, baby
No tricks only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme tha number
But make sure you call before you leave

[Pussycat Dolls]
I know you like me I know you like me
I know you do I know you do
Thats why whenever I come around
She's all over you she's all over you
I know you want it I know you want it
It's easy to see it's easy to see
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fucking me babe

[Chorus:]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha
Don't cha
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha
Don't cha

Fight the feeling fight the feeling
Leave it alone leave it alone
Cause if it ain't love
It just aint enough to leave my happy home my happy home
Let's keep it friendly let's keep it friendly
You have to play fair you have to play fair
See I dont care
But I know She ain't gonna wanna share

[Chorus:]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha
Don't cha
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha
Don't cha

[Busta Rhymes]
Ok, I see how it's goin' down ahh, don't cha
Seems like shorty wanna little menage pop off or somethin, let's go
Well let me get straight to it
Every broad wan watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the god almighty, lookin all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my ass then vanjewish
Lookin at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me till my balls black an blueish
Ya wanna play wit ah playa girl then play on
Strip out the channel
And leave the lingerie on
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin at ya wan break my back
You the very reason why I keep a pack ah the Magnum
An wit the wagon hit chu in the back of tha magnum
For the record, don't think it was somethin you did
Shorty all on me cuz it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get so I could hit the both of y'all

[Pussycat Dolls]
I know she loves you I know she loves you
So I understand I understand
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
If you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime maybe next lifetime
Possibly possibly
Until then old friend
Your secret is safe with me

[Chorus:]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha
Don't cha
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha
Don't cha
