Zigga [7x]
Ha ha ha, yo
Ya'll [25x]

Yo, I walk through brick walls
Fuck around hijack your whole shopping malls
I be rippin shit, that's my word bond
Scream then I watch the whole planet earth respond
Do just what ya told 
The remote control
Crash cars and shit
Ya know how we role
When I tumble and drive then you reply my my my my my my
Yo I execute all plans
Run up in two bitches for me and my mans
Ha, breakin flows, ha for my fans

Strike matches, golden egg hatches
Request line is open send all your faxes
Freaks the flows with no rehersan
Pull the skate back which when the beat start reversin
Just so wak you make people start cursin
Flows contradict worser than the King James version
Turn on the mic but your shit will stop workin
Beats brudlized your whole rhyme, your head hurtin
Broom sticks and britches from rags to riches
Forget mad love
Well ya'll niggas britches
Amateur, why won't you look right at the calender
A matter of time before I start to damage ya
So starting to just bust my rhyme calbo
Consecutive wounds like a nigga stamager
Ya, my whole team get wild cream
Poloticin every move to the extreme

[Chorus4x]
So hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before

Ha, yo I come right through the door 
With rhymes galore Busta Rhymes be the imbasator
Explore my metaphor you beg for more
Hardcore serious surely insurcure
I said my whole squad of niggas come through and break the law
My family tight more than collect four
I come through and create the master pieces
Bend your mind with rhyme colictalictist
Ya'll, I will break shit down
Lost or found floor will blast like a four pound
Right before I hit you off with my vaccine
Starch, cobohidrates lots of protein
Vaccine baby girl yo I hope your ass clean
Magazine frontine fly lips is lime green
Ya'll, every time ya'll, I'm on the scene
High beam the lights and watch will remain supreme, ha
Don't ya know when I keep it comin
Blow the fort 
Make ya wrist hard to hand cuffin
Bounce on the beat and watch how a nigga work it
Buck wild makin ya speaker short curcit
This heavy weight tip the scale on the triple beam
Busta Rhymes blast and still bang the main screen, blow
I had ta make ya all mad
Hit ya off, interlude 
Bounce to Trinidad
Know I see a bitch nigga soft
Make a nigga cough, breakin and turn ya ass off
Extra raw l
Lay on your back and on the floor
Busta Rhymes got to headline the whole ball
Cause we so hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard we ain't heard this before

[Chorus3x]
Ya'll ......
