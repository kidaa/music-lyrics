You know me, the only G to willy a porshe
[Busta]
We get dough in all land the size of philly of course
Can imagine the price that my jewelry really would cost

Fuck around and you can really get tossed
Ken Griffey flow, call me Alaska 'cause I be the king of the frost aw man 
cmon

[Chorus]
[Hook: Busta]
Five thousand boomin watts
I got a thousand karats all over my watch

We rockin ya block shit, wylin like rock shit
Strapped with the gun and the street corner hot shit
[Diddy]
Now we sittin' in the drop top pretty
Knock, knock who is he?
