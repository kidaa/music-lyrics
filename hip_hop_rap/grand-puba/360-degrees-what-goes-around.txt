[Grand Puba Maxwell]
Here comes the Puba and you know I won't fake it
Usually bust records on gettin butt naked
Made for the Benzi, drive a nigga skins he
pump the tape, grab your dick, get with the Puba frenzy
C'mon honey sing, don't you, try to eject
_Slow Down_'s what you say, once my joint gets erect
Some try to copy but they just can't sketch it
Some try to follow but they just can't catch it
With the boom boom tap, yeah alla dat
Huh, I'm livin fat, me fall off, there'll be none of that
See who's the one to flip it  Quick to tell a nigga to zip it
Stud drink the 40 cause we ain't got time to sip it
Grand Puba got body
Kick some of them, some of those, and some yardies
As dope as they come, suckers sing or hum
Don't try to step to this, you know your shit is slum
First batter up well here's the pitch - it's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
The one who arouse, as I browse for a blouse
Kick styles by the piles, as I leave a trail for miles
Skins when I please, hit from here to Tel Aviv
I'm gettin G's, no more time for the line of free cheese
Here's the four one one hon, the one who gets the job done
I know you know the flavor of the Puba

 quot;What goes around comes back around again.. quot;
[GPM] Yeah yeah yeah yeah, na-nah nah nah nah, this how we bump it yo!
 quot;What goes around comes back around again.. quot;
[GPM] Yaknahmsayin  Big Jeff in the house, we gon' move it like this
 quot;What goes around comes back around again.. quot;
[GPM] Ha hah, Baby Pop Baby Pop in the house, bust how we bust it down
 quot;What goes around comes back around again.. quot;
[GPM] Y'all you know the flavor.. Sincere Allah, check check check check!

[Grand Puba Maxwell]
O-kay o-kay o-kay, what more could I say
Alamo get the boom and.. parlay parlay
I'm far from the average, civilize the savage
When I'm low on protein I'm with the bean soup and cabbage
Skins on the diet, kick the flavor, cause a riot
Do a show and get the dough and then I'm off to the Hyatt
So tie me on the spliff, ain't no ands or if
And if you really wanna riff you just might end up playin stiff
Girbauds hangin baggy, Hilfiger on the top
Knapsack on the back, that's just my flavor Hobbes
As my man gives a zigga zigga, watchin three grow bigga bigga
To Pos K, that's my nigga
Here goes the wreck, whaddayou expect
If you wanna see some wreck, send cash, not a check
Grand Puba, more than a public figure
Quick to kick the bone up the butt of a golddigger
Now Tic-Tac-Toe means I hit three in a row
If I do a show then you better have my dough
Low, low, well how low can you go
Call on Grand Puba if you really need a pro
Cause my shit's more rugged than G.I. Joe
Don't front honey, act like you know
Now big up to my Brooklyn mob Brooklyn!  Brooklyn!
Big up to my Uptown mob Uptown!  Uptown!
Now brothers wanna diss me cause it's my turn to burn
My best advice for the brothers is to sit back and learn
I don't diss nobody to be somebody
I just like to kick the flavor to make the people party
See all I'm sayin, is respect due
Those who tried to follow, sorry I left you
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie and Alamo
So if you ever want the flavor you know where to go
Now how we go..

Yeah, ha ha ha!
The reel to reel, yeah yeah yeah, this is how we move it
You know the flavor, y'all know the flavor, you know the flavor
Here we go yo, and you don't stop big up to all the people
Big up!  Big up!
Big Jeff hold tight!  Ha hah, ha hah!
On and on y'all
Time to get gone
Word is bond
