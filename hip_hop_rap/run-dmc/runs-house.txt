[RUN]
A whole lot of superstars, on this stage her tonight
But i want yall to know one thing-this is....
[DMC] My House
[RUN] and when i say who's house, yall know what time it is.
Who's house
Runs house!

[RUN]
ah, once again my firend
not a trend for then 
they said, rap was crap
but never had this band
till the ruler came
with a cooler name
make ya dance and prance and draw the fans to stades
name is Run my son
number one for fun
not a gun that's done and get done by none
the others act in fact ya just wack i kill
[DMC] why
[RUN] because its fun my son and Run heads the bill!

[chorus]
Who's house
Run's house!
[repeat twice]

[DMC]
Im in the house yall
im in the house yall
and this is how Run DMC will turn it out yall
im in the house yall 
im in the house yall
and this is what run dmc be about yall
will my name is dmc,
the all-time great
i buts the most rhymes in New York state
Reporters Claw
Producers die
they want to be down with the king!
the wanted man from the wanted clan
wanted by every fan from across the land
not a G.A.N.G from off the street
R. and U.N. D.M.C complete!

[chorus]

[DMC] get on the mic and emcee
[RUN]
another time i take
for the rhyme i make
make me mad and sad because the fad is fake
see i do this thing so come presue this king
one mind i rhyme so all you just break 
cus im the best im def
ask the rest they left
thats my name my game and we dont need the rep
so keep the booze you loose and suckas cool your mouth 
i set a trap for rap thats crap
its run's house!

[chorus]

[DMC]
some underestimate
and miscalculate
my intent to create what i call the great 
till i make a song that i prove em wrong 
see my song so strong ittll make em come along
come in the door
get on the floor
hard rock hard hitting hiphop hard-core
causing casualties and catastrophes
and tragedies for the suck emcees
use a strategy to get the best of me
you dirty rat emcees
whoever you may be 
you need to go down south
you need to shut your mouth
its all about no doubt just shout cus we turn it out!

[Chorus]
