A Dollar A Rhyme But We Barely Get A Dime

If You Dont Own The Master
Then The Master Own You
Who Do You Trust From Swindlers Lust
From The Back Of The Bus
Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
And Swindlers Lust

Hickory Dickory Dock Hand In My Pocket
Robbed Me For My Chocolate
Mo Dollars Mo Cents For The Big Six
Another Million Led To Bled Claimin They Innocence
Is It Any Wonder Why Black Folks Goin Under
Cause Niggas Be Sold In Bundles
No Pressure Tell Me Why They Dont Care
Rap And R & B Pavin The Streets Of Belair
From The Sales Of Singers No Longer Here
The Bigger Killer Gets The Bigger Share

Now The Ones I Attack The Negros Got Their Back
And Know 80-20 Is A Whack Contract
Forever Lack The Voice Of Real Black
Stole Rock And Roll And Aint Gave It Back
Started Off My Defense
Now Theyre The Ones I Defend Against
Who Fell Up Into The Tricks
Fuck The Fight The Power Shit
Get That Chuck D Nigga Fixed
And Keep Him Up Outta The Mix
Well Hell Tell Em Chuck Dont Suck No Dick
Be An Ass And The Ass Get Kicked
Hand In My Pocket Robbed Me For My Chocolate
Watch Em Swindle Yo Ass And Turn A Profit

If You Dont Own The Master
Then The Master Own You
Who Do You Trust From Swindlers Lust
From The Back Of The Bus
Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
And Swindlers Lust


They Dont Care About Me
They Dont Care About You
They Dont Care About You And Ya Crew
Ya Family Neighborhood And Plus
They Dont Give A Damn About Us

Profit Off The Soul Of Black Folk
Turn Em Into Bitchez And Niggas
And Stupid Ass Jokes
Laugh Wit Us Or Laughin At Us
That Is What Im Guessin
We Interrupt This Program Wit That Question
Laughin All The Way To The Bank
Remember Dem Own The Banks
And Dem G-Damn Tanks
Now What Company Do I Thank
Aint This A Bitch Heard They Owned Slaves
And A Ship That Sank

If You Dont Own The Master
Then The Master Own You
Who Do You Trust From Swindlers Lust
From The Back Of The Bus
Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
And Swindlers Lust

This Is For The Blues People In The Delta
This Is For Everybody In The 50s That Didnt Get Their Money
Little Richard Gettin Half A Penny A Penny
All The Super Soul Singers Of The 60s
All The Bands Of The 70s On The Outside Lookin In
All The People That Didnt Make A Dime Off Their Session Playin
And Even The Rappers In The 80s And The 90s
Still Tryin To Get Paid For What They Put In

If You Dont Own The Master
Then The Master Own You
Who Do You Trust From Swindlers Lust
From The Back Of The Bus
Neither One Of Us Control The Fate Of Our Soul
And Swindlers Lust
