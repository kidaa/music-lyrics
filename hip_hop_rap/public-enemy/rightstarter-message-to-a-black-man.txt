-C. RIDENHOUR-H. SHOCKLEE-

You spend a buck in the 80's, what you get is a preacher
Forgivin' this torture of the system that brought 'cha
I'm on a mission and you got that right
Addin' fuel to the fire, punch to the fight
Many have forgotten what we came here for
Never knew or had a clue, so you're on the floor
Just growin not knowin about your past
now you're lookin' pretty stupid while you're shakin' your ass

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't deny cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this right

Some people fear me when I walk this way
Some come near me, some run away
Some people take heed to every word I say
Some wanna build a posse, some stay away
Some people think that we plan to fail
Wonder why we go under or go to yail
Some ask us why we act the way we act
Without lookin' how long they kept us back

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't deny it cause I'll never be quiet

Yes you if I bore you, I won't ignore you
I'm sayin things that they say I'm not supposed to
Give you pride that you may not find
If you're blind about your past then ill point behind
Kings, Queens, warriors, lovers
People proud, sisters and brothers
It's the biggest fear, suckers get tears
When we can top their best idea

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't deny it cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this right

Our solution, mind revolution
Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Corners don't sell it, no you can't buy it
Can't defy it cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this right

Our solution, mind revolution
Can't sell it, no you can't buy it in a potion
You lie about the life that you wanted to try
Tellin' me about a head, you decided to fly
Another brother with the same woes that you face
But you shot with the same hands, you fall from grace
Every brother should be every brother's keeper
But you shot with your left while your right was on your beeper

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't deny it cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this right

As the world turns, it's a terrible waste
To see the stupid look sluck on your face
Timebomb alarm for the world, just try it
Known to all zones as the one man riot
I'm on a mission to set you straight
Children, it's not too late
Explain to the world when it's plain to see
To be what the world doesn't want us to be

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't deny it cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this right
