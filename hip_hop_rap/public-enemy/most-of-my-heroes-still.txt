I don't care what that company spent 
Its inevitable
They cant prevent the event 
Through it all
I tell em all to stand tall
If I fall
Just add another face to the wall
After all
These are the faces
That they wont show

[Flavor Flav]
Cause these are the names they don't want you to know

Yes we can they say no we cant

Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp

From the pin, of the mind, of the minista
Those oppose, and the s 1's will see ya
All praises are due, don't forget this
On the grind, now dig this.

Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp
