Look girl you sexy as you wanna be
But you just a wanna be

I just met ya I might shove ya
Will I plug ya to some niggas that'll drop some change in yo purse
Hoe what I look like I ain't no trick bitch you gone chose big pimpin first
On God's green earth I shall not hurt 
For money food shelter or work

Chicken, dimes, hoes in skirts
Im in my truck smokin purt
Tryna see how many flirt
Ridin round the A.T.L. on the baddest bitch search
Yeah I did a concert but I don't wanna talk about it
You say like that freaky shit well freaky bitch be about it
Or candy truck you jumped bitch you can jump up out it

I'm headed to yo crib and its straight lights out wit cha

[Chorus 2x]
Hey we the hype now the limelight is ours now

[2x] Sexy, Goregous, Beautiful 
Would you do something real freaky tonight

Now call me Bruce Lee or that pimp I got that glow I'm limelight 
How can life go wrong when I got a brainiac that swallows pipe
She roam the streets like its halloween so tricks can trick or treat all night
My pimpin keep them hoes hooked like I had them jays on that white
Ridin out in a Hummer which I call a lunch box
Standin on 26s which I call em hightops
Candy red paint on that yeah that thang a cherry pop
All peanut butter seats always leather never cloth
Hoe you couldn't wipe my pimpin off if you had a rag 
yeah she knows her pops but I'm the one she calls dad
Straight swurvin in the whip passin blunts takin drags 
Watchin dvds in the truck while she out there sellin ass

[Chorus]

Peanut butter, Royal Chocolate 
Caramel Jazzebell
I offer dick you offer ass for sell
Now you ask a player 
See me shining getting right
Finally coming up call me pimp tight
What you'll do for the limelight 
Them bisexuals I call em klinedikes
Vanilla want a nut on Sunday
Fill hot fudge in the middle of her tummy
Butter pecan white chocolate love day
Niggas lookin fly so remember where the hershay
Hoes at Davana of the scanna 
Pussy split on my bannana
Take they pic on who they gone sample
To Michigan back down to Alabama
Poped hypontic be the flava
that water their jaws for the milk they shake up
Captain save em
A.K. just gone lace up the beat
to be a suckas favorite
Top it off for the celebration
After I bang her i'll let you cake her
You were too seet she needed a banga
Make her melt let it drip through her fangers

Sexy, Goregous, Beautiful
Would you do something real freaky tonight

Now I'm in the limelight
This rose gold bring plenty dikes
They come around to service me because they know I lay the pipe
I'm running wit the king we in different cities every night
Broads strippin out they clothes before the D.J. pass the mic
Puerto Rican mama citas, Asian bitches mixed wit white
They come to see the P$C in many skirts and see threw tops
I love this life
Thats main reason I ain't settle down ain't got no wife
I'm down wit the squad
Done wit the hard 
I be pimpin these hoes for the rest of my life

Sexy women freaky ladies
Squeezin T.I.P.'s Mercedes
Kissin women, eatin ladies, lick em till they drikin babies
Like Rick James was in the 80s young and rich and livin crazy
