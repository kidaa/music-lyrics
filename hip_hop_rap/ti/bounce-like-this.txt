[Verse]
Chinchilla to the floo
Ciggarella fulla dro
White benz leather doors
I can change color though
New ferrari red bent
Black truck on 24's
Several cheverlots on 20 inches maybe more
Used to wish for better days 
Now i wish for never more
I can go bout anything
Stick my dick in every hole
Grand hustlin on everything
Kids see in every store
Sellin everything from rubberbands to leather coats
Swear to god id never change
Other niggas never no
Tippin never been a lame
Gigalo since '84
Blessed wit astonishin ability to pull a hoe
Fuck her so good make her think its dick is for the mo
Pussy so good but i love the way she suck it slow
Her motto u dont swallow what you sucking for?
My motto you aint ballin what you hustlin for?
These vvs's let off such a glow to let the busters no

[Chorus]
Hey hey

Bend it over for me drop it like its hot could ya
Wiggle your titties a little lift your top get ya to
Bust it open show your panties and ur ass for me

In the back lickin the bottom half of me
Answer me first no then sayin no is blast from me

Get your partner out the pants for me
Damn honey youd be a fool if u ran from me
You aint fuckin wit another dummy im the man honey

Though the pussy right maybe you can get a gram from me
Ha picture pimpin givin you some damn money
Not one damn dime but your ass still fine

Now shawty stall if u want to i ball when i want to
The fall threw and shut down the mall if i want to
I can make your gilrfriend chew but i wont choose
Why you bother me what you will or you wont do?
Listen shorty im a grown man and you grown to
You can live wit me i dont gotta telephone you
All im thinkin bout is me layin on you
Or vise versa wit a lotta ass to hold on to
I got somethin for that ass to bounce on to
Your missin a chance of a life time why dont you
Hop up in the drop top ride threw the city like
Take you where i kick it let you see what pimpin livin like
Pop one of these see what you feelin like
Takin off ur clothes want to no what its drilly right
Pesidental suite at the very end of the night
Treat you like a freak and give ya what was missin in your life

[Chorus]
