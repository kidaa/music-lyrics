[Verse 1: T.I.]
New Akoo outfit with a gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my louis bag
Full of stacks rubberbands round big cash
Got a sick swag tell the haters get mad, comeon 
We in the club homes gettin our thug on
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out
When it dark out, get the squad out
We ball hard sucka nigga eat your heart out
I'm too advanced super swag in my Louis pants
Ballin on my Louis silk shirt match my Louis rag

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Alright Alright OK OK I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
Alright Alright OK OK I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 

[Verse 2: T.I.] 
I Say, "Whoa kimosabe!", big ballin is my hobby
I'm boppin while I'm walkin, rag fallin out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic, homie I ain't even talkin
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossin at the mall mall, talkin to a broad broad
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
Three pair of shoes, four shirts, six rags
The chick said, "Dag, that's more than my bag!"
Shawty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf hangin out of my jeans
Naw homie, I ain't thinkin I'm just doin my thing!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Alright Alright OK OK I don't dance I don't dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
Alright Alright OK OK I don't dance I don't dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
HEY SWANG! 

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I took some time off okay, and now I'm back y'all that's right
You in the line at the club, I'm in the back dawg haaah!
And when this song on, ballers peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall
Let it sag with ya pants get ya swag just right
Ride Bankhead flare flyin out the benz
Once a fool with it we 'gon bring 'em out again

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Alright Alright OK OK I don't dance I don't dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
Alright Alright OK OK I don't dance I don't dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
