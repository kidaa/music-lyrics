R-E-S-P-E-C-T M-Y H-U-S-T-L-E
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Wont accept nothin less, so respect this hustle
I aint in it for the fame I aint in it for the glory
I'm down to die for it absolutely mandatory
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Wont accept nothin less, so respect this hustle

These niggas bitch made i'm gettin paid six ways
my shits laid and shits sprayed with lemonade with blades,
keep your mouth closed you dont want to get sprayed
shoot you down your body make you sun bathe six days,
Kamikazee renegade, now we never been afraid
kept the trap hot enough to fry egg in the shade,
I ball till the day lying dead in the grave
leave the feds behind the wall cause i aint get away,
chopper round the corner in a bush with a brick of yay,
a bust can happen any day, we out here trapping anyway,
gettin money to them Haitians damn what a nigga say,
i got a real bad condition if i ain't gettin paid,
hand over fist what im missing got to get busy,
i know you see this car I'm driving and see the house that i live in
and figure this is enough,
but nigga i want way more really this is play doe, you set your sites way low.
i had enough of the game i don't know whether to stay or go.
different groups of lames and suckers i don't know which way i go,
well nigga you know you king why you always got to say it for?
cause they said i couldn't say it before,
and i remember all it did was f**k my temper up more Doug and "J" know,
I say I wear the crown, not a halo sorry,
niggas think they seeing me but they so sorry,
they fast but they ain't no ferrai, NRROWM.

You think you been pulling gats cussing fussing enough
here bragging bout these niggas you been busting enough,
man look around ain't nobody suffering but her,
you could beat a hundred cases catch one and you fucked.
i get probation
is you crazy pull your gun in the club,
see how many folks and polices put you down in the club.
if we got to come with a slug why we come to the club
how much more of this shit you think we can put under the rug
look we already told them I Told You So,
but all these niggas speaking out whoever spoke before,
don't take it personal people want to be close to folk,
what you think the television and the posters for?
im claustrophobic though
well then you need to see a doctor for it,
man i aint joking you close t.i.p. and bout to blow it,
did you forget about them nights in the cells was you honesty
when we was having talks with God and you promise,
if he could make away for you to be large and you done it.
out the gate Urban Legend went on to do numbers,
sold a mill made ATL king first week,
five hundred with the Grammy but not the one that i wanted,
what about them eight figure deals and that other new money,
but ask yourself something where the
gun you got from me? Keep it real...

You need to think of someone other than yourself some time, did you keep your promise...
Keep it real.
