"Hate the price of fame 'cause it costs too much" yeah boy
"And you lame niggaz talk too much" yeah
"I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em" yeah boy
"I said I'm ready for whatever, hey hey"

[Verse 1]
Even though my head in the clouds, my planet on the pavement
How I'm walking around, people stand and amaze me
And I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playing with it
They so judgmental, everyday they don't understand
If your life was in jeopardy, everyday is you telling me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony
Consider this at least, I got everybody sweating me
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressing me, ain't nobody protecting me
I'm dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me
Think 'cause no one's arrested, they coming for me eventually
This was all the things I was going through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Now mention them New Orlean niggaz coming in the city
Killing all summer long, ain't nobody paying attention

[Interlude]
Now is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong and I know that my excuses aren't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice

[Chorus]
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You're waiting on me to die, you're gonna be waiting for a minute
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I'll be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real
Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it costs too much
Plus these sucker niggaz lame and they talk too much
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I'll be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real

[repeat + ad-libs]
For real

[Verse 2]
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, gotta admit it I'm guilty
But understand, feel me how I ride filthy
'cause niggaz out there plot to rob me and kill me
500 thousand every year spent on security
And my future walk bright, but now it's getting blurry
'cause niggaz in the air ready to find me and bury me
But surely, God will deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart and I forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons, and sit to my community
Look at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity
Mentally, I was focused on not letting history repeat itself,
That's why heat was kept in that vicinity
"Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously"
Through all of the publicity, was anybody considering
My position and the logic came from my decision
"But they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period"

[Interlude]
But is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong and I know that my excuses aren't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice

[Chorus]

[repeat + ad-libs]
For real
