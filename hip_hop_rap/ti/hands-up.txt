[Man speaking]
We going to Cuba wit' this one
Yea, I been rehabilitated, rejuvicated
And most important:relocated
So now, with no further to do

[Hook 2x]
Now ladies stand up
Or if you wit' me shake ya titties
Throw your hands up
And all the ballers poppin' bottles throw a grand up
And if you feeling like I'm feeling keep them hands up
And keep ya hands up

Hey, from the sunrise to the midnight star
I'm by far the hottest new thing the South seen
Bringing sixteen bars, got six clean cars
Vert's, Hoops, four doors, do momo's, and Tahoes
Star hoes, yo hoes is our hoes
Keri pullin up to the Shark Bar on the Northstar
Wit' a Puerto Rican porn star
We in La Vida La Loca
See you can't flow like me or rock a show like me
Get dough like me 
Shouldn't signed 'em, he ain't gon' blow like me
But give me a quarter of his bonus and half his budget
And I guarantee he go double but if you don't, you in trouble
It's gon' take him three coupes just for him to recoup'
Or witness shawty flop, like the last three groups
While I'm in Cancun' 'round see-thru's on a three week cruise
It'll take more than the likes of these fools to make me lose
Sheesh, floppin is something I can't see
Ladies, obey the chorus
Shake ya titties for me please

[Hook 2x]

Uh, I came to blow the spot
Hit the club wit' cheddar knots
Ridin wit' a badder bitch
You gonna get or ever got
Try me boy, you better not
Shawty and I'm very hot
Toting forty cap, forty five nine's every glock
Blow you up in that very spot you standing in
Then vanishing
Undo this manana then, throw away this can and then
Back to poppin mo and blow and dro and money handlin'
You and your lil' posse can not stop me and this clan I'm in
While you slanderin', you better ask ya gul who the man again
Turning out a superstar back into a fan again
Damagin' all who peek, line 'em all in the street
I'll do 'em one at a time wit' one line on one beat
Say ya almost gold, that's what I sold in one week
Got a flock of freaks, while you hold on to one biich
I'm like a Pez dispenser, shawty, I spit treats
The nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat

[Hook 2x]

Well pussy nigga, you can like it, you can love it
You can bite it, you can dub it
But you can't do it how we does it
When we ballin' in public
Where the grill full of gold or Seville full of hoes
Wood wheels and some Voe's or hun'ed gold spokes
I park at the club and a hun'ed hoes choke
Spark up some dubs, let them hun'ed hoes blow
I run game to get the hoe once they act like I can't run it no mo'
I stunt them hoes broke and her money po' po'
You can't smoke the way we smoke if you ain't smokin' no dro'
Drink the way we drink wit no Hen' and no Mo'
You can't ride the way we ride if you ain't slammin Benz do's
Can't ball wit' me if you got eight but can only spend fo'
You ain't VIP like me and can't be searching your coat
Ain't no P.I. like me if you ain't workin' no hoes
Can't do the shit we do, the way we do wit' no dough
That's like trying to win a ballgame, if you ain't takin no score

[Hook 4x]
