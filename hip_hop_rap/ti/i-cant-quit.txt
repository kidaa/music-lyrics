[T.I]
Hell no I cant quit
Hell no man we got to much money to get shawti stay down grand hustle
Look...
IM this far from being a star and just that close to quittin
I never should of came close to missing
But I want to be a musician pimpin not a politician listen feel my position this a rough transition
Plus I'm way to deep in the game to be trying to change
From fortune and fame and glamour I could be in the slammer
Or six feet under Atlanta its a blessing to breath I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing the G T.I.P is still be blessing CD's so haters you can see these
Cause I'm back now with something to prove everything to gain pimpin nothing to lose
I oughta start smackin niggas when there's nothing to do
They to big shoot em in the leg and even the odds cause you aint hard
Less you round with captain C ROD Trap with KT and brawl with JR
Fuck hoes with DP broke bread with JG 
Switch labels like KP poofa did all that to me even
Though I'd rather go back to slangin drugs an shit
This a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit

[Chorus]
I Can't Quit
Even though Police's hate on legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naw I cant quit
Some niggas hatin on the money I'm getting
Most of them hatin cause im fuckin they bitch
Naw pimpin I can't quit
Some niggas hatin on the rocks and the rings 
Some of them hate cause they dont think I'm the king
Hell naw i cant quit
People hate it when you better then them
They ain't hate start worrying then
Hey I'm winning I cant quit

[T.I]
Ten years an album and two deals fo' real we all know I should of sold two million at least
It's all good though I flow for the streets I do it for yall every weekend see who in the mall
Still in the traps signing your shirts given you doubt
Kikin it with ya' then get yo' and your folk into the club
Holes of the pictures where girls gave kisses and hugs 
Hold and I look at the show passing niggas the drove
One of the realist rappers niggas will know
But niggas be hatin to the point where they be calling the station
But they respect it cause  I'm ready and focused 
Then I see they panties an vocals, I want you to know
This the closest you know this
Niggas in the game ain't real got to stay sellin records cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name will sell 
They'll break your hearts and see your favorite rappers lame as hell

[Chorus]

[T.I]
Some of the people some of time times 
Some of you rhyme but might not like one of them lines
I tell you, I let you criticize me one of them times
Those of you that think I'm to cocky get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like it when you say im tyte
I say I already know
Don't like how I was talkin shit before my album blowed
Think I need to calm it down become more like the average Joe
So, fuck yo' little thoughts and that little house you think I'm in
Get a Benz i value your opinion then think i give a fuck how many times my record spins
Well what you recommend, I'm back again 

[Chorus]
