[Chorus]
On top of the world and I'm standin tall
But if I ever ever have to take a fall
Will you accept my collect call
Will you accept my collect call
Cuz everybody loves you when you ballin
But don't nobody want you when you fallin
I gotta know will you accept my collect call
I gotta know will you accept my collect call

I was told way back in the days when I was trappin
Never mind what niggas say judge 'em all on their actions
It's hard to imagik in the day when I was trappin
Never mind what nine when you traveling
Havin fun gettin paper catch a case and see how niggas act then
Out a cell partner been fired he rattin on me
Got a little benja pension now they turn they back on me
Shit cuz out of sight is out of mind
Better put your trust in God homie man will let you down everytime
And I'm speaking experience, serious
Imagine my surprise hearin from the inside
Everybody talkin bout me like the nigga just died
TIP gone, 20 years at the least get 5
Man niggas just lie for suspicion of they snitchin
Not to mention the rumors of me committin suicide
God will open your eyes and show you who really with ya
But keep it in the back of your mind when its over how niggas did ya

[Chorus]

I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me
I wouldn't do in return but guess you live and you learn
Don't expect my well bein to be a nigga concern
Cuz I know that ain't the way the world turn
Cuz everybody love to see a nigga assed out
Rather see you lose it all than to see you cash out
They gossip like bitches I don't even ask how
Cuz niggas ain't shit! I believe that now
And it don't even matter how much you do for people they'll love to
See you beat down livin in the gutta, what a
Shame at the least in the game when you see
They want you locked up more than the police
The same can't wait to get a nigga off the street
They hate to see me sittin on buckets off C
Dog beat bet to you don't even make sense
But that mentality is exactly why you'll never be rich , HATER!

[Chorus]

I remain a stand up guy no matter what I
Stood tall chest out head up high
With my back against the wall layin it all on the line
With God on my side I perform everytime
Must I remind you
Similar to a miracle just short of amazin
Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy
Rose to the occasion whatever situation
Surprised haters and came out gun a blazin
Theoretically speakin but you rather be thinkin
I'll fold cuz you want a view of me I know
All I got is the family, friends come and go
And with that understandin I put none before
My folk you know enough to do the same I hope
If not, shit ya ass will find out
When you on top everybody wanna ball with ya
but when you not you wouldn't even know who to call would ya?
