I'm a tell ya'll sucka niggas somethin
Who wants to follow me
Look here dawg

[Chorus]
You might see me in the street
But nigga you don't know me
When ya holla on the speak
Rememba you don't know me
Save all the hatin and the poppin
nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin niggas you my partna
Nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin
Nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin but the truth is
Really you don't know me
Ya you know they call me T.I.
But you don't know me
You be hatin and I see why
Cuz you don't know me

I think its time i made a song fo niggas who don't know me
I graduated at the streets, Ima real OG
I been trappin shootin pistols since I stood on four feet
So while you niggas actin bad, you gon have to show me
You gone make me bring a chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin, wonder when its gonna cease
Cap'll hitchu on the side and create a slow leak
We been in the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin on me
I giva fuck about the feds investigation on me
I don't care they at my shows and they waitin on me
Ima keep a flossy poppin long as to is on the beat
Tell police that I ain't stoppin Ima keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo believes, im as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings nigga you don't know me.

[Chorus]

Hey once again let me remind you nigga you don't know me
So don't be walkin up and askin whats the deal ona Ki.
I don't know if you wearin wires you could be the police
If I was slangin dope you couldnt get an OZ
See me at the PSC follow thru and tha show deep
Hommies holdin up the doe, cuz they know we toat heat
I just wanna wrap a C, blow a dro ina flee
Only playin bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill with country and his daddy Freddy G
Ballin out everytime, every stone is but a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas curtousy of KT
Fact I only gotta Mill. as well as a dolla DP
Ak house on the hill right next to JG
Everyweek be there for lunch, busta blunt and eat free
Get in day paid Lil Craig dead meat
That's the only shot we got at gettin cap back on the streets

[Chorus]

You see a nigga hatin on a G
Ask em what's it gonna be
Whatcha lookin at, pussy nigga you don't know me
At the club, in the streets
Or where ever we should meet
It's choppa choppin pistols poppin nigga you don't know me [2x]

[Chorus]
