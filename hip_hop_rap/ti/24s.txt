in a drop top chevy with the roof wide open my partners looking at me to see if my eyes open cause I've been drankin, and
I've
been smokin and flying down 285 but I'm focused its a four fifty four SS, I raise Porches white leather seats,
as fresh
as air forces doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping number 8 on NWA straight out of Compton pull up at your
apartment sitting on 20 something and the dope boys, saying the kids running in the clicks start dealing and the broads start
choosing and the cars been parked but the rims keep moving 
sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood cause I
ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood I'm use to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating 24 inch jays got the
chevrolet shaking

[Chorus]
money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggaz roll
blowing dro on 24's, 
thats how all my niggas roll
money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggaz roll
blowing dro on 24's,
thats how all my niggas roll

[T.I.]
I'll make a mill and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest at the age of seventeen, entertaining the rides, I want the best I
refuse
to get a 9 to 5, I'm a flip my keys been paying my dues since 89, trying to get my cheese diamonds gleam when I'm on the
scene, they know its me aint no dream or no fantasy b*tch its T I P brought busting, like a baby do a blanket 5 karats on my
motherfucking pinkie, half of hennessy and belevedere what we dranking, pimps send for broads what the hell you niggas

got a strong mind to grab my dro nine, and shoot at your ass for a long time but I'm a get that ass, all dog, fuck around

[Chorus]

money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggaz roll
blowing dro on 24's,
