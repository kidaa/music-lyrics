If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me 

what would you do

If I told you you were beautiful
Would you page me on the regular 

tell me would you

Well baby I've been around the world
But I aint seen myself another girl 

like you

This ring here represents my heart
But there is just one thing I need from you 

saying I do 

Because, I can see us holding hands
walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us in the country side
sitting in the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Gonna make you my lady
Girl you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love 

My love
My love 

And I know no woman that could take your spot 

My love
My love
My love 

And I know no woman that could take your spot 

My love
My  loooooooove
Looooooove
My loooove 
My loooove 

Now If I wrote you a love note 
And make you smile with every word I wrote 

what would you do 

Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one in my scene 

tell me would you

See what's the point in waiting anymore
Cause girl I've never been more sure 

that baby it's you

This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waiting for 

Just saying I do

Because, I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us in the country side
Sitting in the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Gonna make you my lady
Girl you amaze me        
Aint gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love 

My love
My love 

And I know no woman that could take your spot my 

My love
My love
My love 

And I know no woman that could take your spot my  

My love
My looooooove
Loooooove
My looooove
My loooooove 

[T.I. Raps]
Shorty, cool as a fan 
On the new once again 
but Still has fans from Peru to Japan 
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can 
Cause your girls real wild throw your hands up high 
Wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy 
You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly 
Friend so fly I can go fly 
Private, cause I handle mine 
t.i. - Call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire 
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny 
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try 
You don't come, I ain't gonna die 
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it with an ace so high 
Baby, you decide that I ain't your guy 
Ain't gon lie ,Me in your space 
But forget your face, I swear I will 
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill 
Just bring wit me a pair, I will 

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us in the country side
Sitting in the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Gonna make you my lady
Girl you amaze me
Aint gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love 

Love
My love
Love
My love
Love 

And I know no woman that could take your spot 

My love
Love 
My love
Love
My love
Love 

And I know no woman that could take your spot
