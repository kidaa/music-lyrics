[Intro: T.I.]
Yeahhhhh hey!
Hahaha, hey, hey, ha all right
Aight Toomp man, this what the folks been waitin on I guess that's right
Let's give it to 'em baby hey!
Grand Hustle nigga
Ay man, they been waitin on this shit since "What You Know" huh?
Yeahhhh, it's the king bitch!
Aight my nigga, the wait is over nigga
Hey, hey!

[T.I.]
One for the money, two for the show dawg
Three for the niggaz hatin on the low, y'all
Know a picture's worth a million words I'ma show y'all
Death before dishonor, family befo' all
Without the braids I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Minus the testimony; say it ain't so homie
Hey! Shorty like that, don't he?
World hopped off my jock, I got 'em right back on it
Ohh! Step back, brush myself off
Picked in and back up right where I left off
I could show my dough that other guys just talk
Hey where I live just as big as yo' projects dawg
AY! Ha ha, better check my swagger
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar
What I drive, how I dress, nigga less just better
A hundred stacks on that nigga I'm just, better
Hahahaha, somebody better tell 'em mayne
They swag owe my swag everythang
It's very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I'd like to thank you cause in all of y'all oughta be
havin y'all swag sendin mines an apology
A lot of little me's I see, got beef
But what's the possibilities? Stop seek, you not me
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated, don't see how half of you rappers made it
Say good-bye to the fame and fortune, c'est la vie
And what the game need with you nigga? They got me
I ride through the city, so clean, seat really low
Automo-bil-ey so, pretty but I'm illy though
No comparison, ain't a nigga mo', thorough than
this gangsta American flow, doper than heroin
King like Evelyn, champagne mayne
So deranged and belligerent; right up there with Benjamin
Who? Andre 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK
Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and, Lupe
So fuck what you say, you welcome to add to you may
Bet they say as of today I'm back on top like a toupee
Hey! All objections overruled, it's overdue
Both hype, it's over too, I'm so high, up over you
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth
Ooh, so uncouth, nigga who want proof?
Must agree if shit I did can't no one undo
I stay on my, one-two, nigga who want two?
Turn a brunch into a brawl, do what you gon' do
I'm why it's, hot as a bitch in here still, cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission dear, think that was somethin missin here
