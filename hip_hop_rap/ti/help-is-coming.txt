They say the game f**ked up 
and the records ain't sellin
It was bad in 06' gettin worse in 07'
Market over saturated with all the bootleggin
When it seems better shawty ain't no tellin'
Well, call Lyor, give him this message
Then hit K'ys tell hiim, tell Kevin, 
Craig, Julie Greenwald, all of them present
The fifty mill you gave me, 
was a sound investment
This time around we gon sell 5, 
no less than 4 on a slow day, 
call vegas and bet
By the way, if you a winner, 
I'm the one you should be with Hit J,
Tell them niggas to bet against
Grand Hustle homie, 
I'm a make you respect this
They say "the market share down", 
so... I ain't affected
Tell the label relax, 
ain't no need to stress shit
Just cut the check a
nd I'll handle the rest...shhiit

You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock
You niggas keep floppin, But i remain on top
Still the same ol' me, With the same ol' glock
From the first cd, With the Kangol top
I was hollerin dopeboy when I first came out
It seems like everyone in the dope game now man
I told these niggas that it ain't gon stop
All the hatin' gon' stop or this thang gon' blah
Most of these niggas ,ain't slang ,no blocks
Got a lil' somethin', but it ain't so hot
Try to sell a record when my shit drop
Get the cover of the magazine 
when my shit out nope
I think not just why, 
if you ever eye with a nigga this fly
You better watch your mouth, 
you ain't that high
KING OF THE SOUTH, you ain't that guy

To the fans and the critics, 
think hip hop is missing
This is a lil' proof that hip hop livin'
You can hear a hip hop top now, just listen
Now see a hip hop walk out with 6 bitches
In the ATL, see hip hop chillin'
In a multimillion dollar crib hip hop building
You know how many cars hip hops driven?
Nigga I'm everything hip hop's missing
Nigga you is everything hip hop isn't
My heart and my soul, where hip hop live at
To anyone whos ever said hip hops finished
It can't be dead while I'm still livin in it
I'm livin and well, might I add that
