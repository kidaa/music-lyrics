[Intro: Ludacris T.I.]
Rich by popular demand The wait is over homie
Yes it is, A-Town connection! Know the city gon' feel this
Damn right Say Toot, I know you see me, 'Cris!
Whattup boy? I know both our pops lookin at us!
Wayne Bridges, whattup? Let's go!
Big Phil, we made this shit happen homie
History in the makin Hey! Hey!
Momma I did it!

[Chorus: B.o.B.]
I used to dream I used to dream ohh-whoa ohh!
About the money and the cars and girls and the girls
But now I see now I see ohh-whoa! ohh!
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! the whole world
And now I see ay see ay see ay see ay
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! ay, ay, ay, ay
And now I see ay see ay see ay see ay
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! ay, ay, yeah, yeah

[T.I.]
Ay, man I remember 'fore I stay that way, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
Now I remember so vivid, me and my niggaz was livin how?
Sub-standard condition, still handlin business that right
Still laughin and trippin, still happen to bitches okay
I'm rappin not reminiscin, and goddamn it we did it
From trappin, standin and pitchin with riches stand in the kitchen
Splittin it eight ways, flip it in eight days
Thought to wild and unruly but just the way to behave
Kept the weigh and the yay' for most the paper we made
And all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine
Had big work to move but we served the small time
Always outshine the niggaz with small minds
Who would thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here, we develop such a sound down here
Been duplicated often still can only be found here BANKHEAD!
Only listen to G's, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?
I'm too fit to bein a player, stare at niggaz careers
Been talkin 'bout it for years and now we finally here

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Luda, Luda! Hear my heart on this one
True story! Rest in peace Wayne Bridges

They say what goes up must come down but I ain't reach my cruisin altitude
Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do?
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm 'bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, "Look out for ME!"
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy headed RICH NIGGA! OHH!
Private planes help me travel in peace
To fo' cities in one day and fo' countries in one WEEK
Cause I, work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart to
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school WOO!
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put 'em all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends' credit true!
And now they witnessed all the glitz and the glamour
Catch us eatin at Straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Orderin Singaporean lobster
Celebratin comin from nothin to winnin Grammy's and rappers winnin Oscars
Yeah, and they say rappers shouldn't act, nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like, "WHASSUP MOTHERFUCKER!"

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I made it momma!

Hey, hey
I know them haters don't stop plottin and wishin we fall
Cause I'm standin on top lookin down at it all I see you
{?} down all to y'all, it seems like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough, we still tryin to triple up
That's why we got StreetCred and Akoo buildin up
Say I'm doin too much, shit, I say I ain't did enough
Remember sayin, "Damn, if I could just get to a million plus"
And now I'm like, "Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?"
Triple that on my bond, thanks to Bigs and Run appreciate it nigga
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become
All this shit I've avoided, what it done for my sons
and daughters and momma; just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school, seems it's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me nah
I broke that cycle, now my family live a live for
Mandatory minimals, but not when the judge sentence us
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?
Answer that Just for standin 'round wishin, huh?
Hey while you stand around lookin dumb, I make it happen
Takin action over time, got damn good at it

[Chorus]
