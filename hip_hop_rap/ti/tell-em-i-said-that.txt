Ay Ay Ay Ay for as long as i remember,

[Chorus]

Ya niggas ain't cool what they rap about
These niggas ain't do
Hear em say it but it really ain't true
Ya niggas ain't true

Dont be no fool you better take ya ass to school
Cause these niggas ain't G's
Gangsta's somethin these niggas cant be
What you expect these niggas ain't me
Ya niggas ain't rich
Ya niggas ain't really gettin bricks

[Verse 1]

He nigga lying everytime you hear rhymin
He dont talk about they diamonds
N how they be out there shinin
For the wrap
Hey were trappin
Tell yall they be at there grindin
And i know they aint about that action
Im tellin ya ima ride em
They prolly try to come in the hood N' sell weed
Think Its all good untill they run into some real G's
Holla tell us where it is
And i promise we'll leave
Hesitate to sayin boy them lamma well squeeze
Please Pay attention to this part of the bull
One time got robbed got shot got shooked
Got a job started rhymin came up with a hook
Got a chain n some tats came up with a look
Went and made it here
Workin talk tough in a bull
Fuck the image and perception they never tough as they look
They some mutha fucking suckers

Any real nigga know better man these niggas

[Chorus]

Ya niggas ain't cool what they rap about
These niggas ain't do
Hear em say it but it really ain't true
Ya niggas ain't true
Ya niggas ain't really
Talkin to em
Dont be no fool you better take ya ass to school
Cause these niggas ain't G's
Gangsta's somethin these niggas cant be
What you expect these niggas ain't me
Ya niggas ain't rich
Ya niggas ain't really gettin bricks

TELL EM I SAID THAT!

[Verse 2]

Ya cant tell
Them niggas aint surely
Get caught with a nigga gon' tell
Them nigga dont sell
This ya g aint gotta put it on a scale
He ask you if it weigh enough just tell em YEAHH
Ya nigga just yell
Pull the pistol them nigga gon bail
If he got a pistol bet he dont spray it
They dont wanna go to jail
And they aint no hell be walkin on shells
Gladiator school is you prepared
I can see these niggas scared
Gotta problem wit me nigga just say it
We can play it how you want to play it
Better go head
40 pistols will be aimed at yo head
All the way down and where yo gold leg
jean really on the edge
jean aint under suspicion of the feds

ya never bought us head
what ya get behind the mic and just said
the people already know i must say it! 

[Chorus]

Ya niggas ain't cool what they rap about
These niggas ain't do
Hear em say it but it really ain't true
Ya niggas ain't true
Ya niggas ain't really
Talkin to em
Dont be no fool you better take ya ass to school
Cause these niggas ain't G's
Gangsta's somethin these niggas cant be
What you expect these niggas ain't me
Ya niggas ain't rich
Ya niggas ain't really gettin bricks
Its official man ya niggas ain't shit
TELL EM I SAID THAT!

[Verse 3]

Ya damn right
These niggas dont have rights
To rap about the shit i did every night
Did u win every fight
You ever went to jail for sellin white
May barbick and trap same night
Yo know these niggas light right
Im speakin on it cause it aint right
Nigga died i survived by the nerve my strife
Went to jail came home
Twenty times got it right
But still tryin keep for shootin sucker niggas i dont like
Cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike
This sucker get a deal now he livin so shy
Ya niggas outta sight actin hard lyin on they record
Know it when you see recognize it dont respect it
Got every right ta check em when you see em in ya city
Run up on em and try em bet you see that they some bitches
Niggas tell you what they want you to hear
Dont tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see

[Chorus]

Ya niggas ain't cool what they rap about
These niggas ain't do
Hear em say it but it really ain't true
Ya niggas ain't true
Ya niggas ain't really
Talkin to em
Dont be no fool you better take ya ass to school
Cause these niggas ain't G's
Gangsta's somethin these niggas cant be
What you expect these niggas ain't me
Ya niggas ain't rich
Ya niggas ain't really gettin bricks
Its official man ya niggas ain't shit
TELL EM I SAID THAT!
