No sweat, it's no sweat, it's no sweat, never never see me sweat
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay tell em folk it's no sweat
naw, no sweat, ay it's no sweat, it's no sweat.
Never let em see me sweat

[Chorus:]
Hey you can ride with my dimes
She keeps em on the way
You say you need that window whirr but blow it away
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
There's no sweat
Never let em see me sweat

Hey I'm the best in the game
Kick it with the best in the game
Ain't no need for me to worry bout the rest of you lames
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat

[Verse:]
Yeah you can call me the king
They also call me the vet
Haters can call me the reason their bitch ain't callin em back
The press be callin me cocky
I ask em what you expect
First album flopped, my label dropped
Man, I took off like a jet
Niggas hate on me often cause I'm a boss and exec
Do anything for my family, willing to die for respect
I bet I got it in cash, the same thing you got in a check
Wonder how I got it so fast, baby you gotta invest
I can be cool to St. Louis, I can be hot as Tibet
for you can get through security, I'd-done got on a jet
you must be under a rock if you haven't heard of 'em yet
Paris and Germany be buggin me I'm certain to that
Anything my heart desires, I can certainly get
The Ferrari light SV what Its be a convertible yes
A lotta niggas say they name but I ain't heard of em yet.
So when I check em they deserve that.

[Chorus:]
Hey you can ride with my dimes
She keeps em on the way
You say you need that window whirr but blow it away
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
There's no sweat
Never let em see me sweat

Hey I'm the best in the game
Kick it with the best in the game
Ain't no need for me to worry bout the rest of you lames
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
It's no sweat
