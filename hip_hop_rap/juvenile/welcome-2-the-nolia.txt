[Juvenile]
It's world war III where I'ma be with 2 stars
better tighten up your act, you bout to get loose, fool
Move all your valuables, cuz them boyz at your throat with them calicos
I mean, me myself, i just don't wanna see nobody get hurt
Wanna live Keep your black ass from out of my turf
You look like wanna of them boyz that ain't never been fucked over
I'm bout to change that, send that boy to THA NOLIA 
Put a pistol in his face, make em' empty out his pockets
If he think we fakin, he gon' know after we cock it
And come to the PJ's, if you wanna score something
Get my peeps laid cuz we make motherfuckers catch the cut quick
Might laugh with ya but we ain't to be trusted
I tie my solja rag tight around my head man
Now I'm gettin processed with a red band

[CHORUS [Juvenile]]

We release with amminition when our beef is in site
Way up in your jurisdiction, bout to turn up the light
No vest, no chest wootay, jeopardize your life
Now we ain't got to explain it to ya, this for everybody
Throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up
Throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up
But throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up
But throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up

[Turk]
Solja's be camoflaugin'
Hittin blocks realla, they be bout ridin
YOu get chopped realla, at any timein'
Cuz in THAT NOLIA they play tha game raw
No more beats closin shop when the beef start
Ah, ah, I don't think you're ready for these niggaz
LDTC-6 coated wild willas
Head bustas, and wig spltitas where I'm from
Choppas max, with red dots in the drum
Playinin it raw with dope
That's how we play it, duckin Chris, flat top & big red
Wootay ain't nothin nice
Spin corners in broad light, can't move stiff like ice
Get killed if the price on yo face, me & Juve burn with case, from the scene 
with fled
Take hits like black & moe did back in the dayz
At night in tha nolia, niggaz be in tha hallwayz

[CHORUS [Juvenile]]

We release with ammunition when our beef is in site

[Turk]
Nigga done flashed up, I had to deal with the bitch
Catch em' down bad, and put some steel on tha bitch
Let em' know this young nigga, ain't to be fucked wit
2 time I'm comin through, 1 time you gettin ya wig split
When I release, aimin straight for your top
Non stop hollin purse nigga, you gon' drop
THA MAGNOLIA chest opena', glock toatera', block soakera'
Down for a murdera'
In tha rover, choppin ya down, put your sets up nigga
Represent that uptown

[JUVENILE]
Fuckin wit theze real boyz, I'ma kill ya
You don't want me hot at you, you know I'ma GORILLA
I've been trained to get way low in the mud
Molded on tha streets and used to runnin wit thugs
Nigga you fuck wit Turk, you gotta fuck wit me what
Where is you gonna be when them boks reeboks in tha mud
Don't make me come down there and show one of you bitches
Don't make me come down there and blow one of you bitches
