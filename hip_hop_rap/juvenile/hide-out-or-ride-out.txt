and in ya chest is many holes

leather seats
and in the trunk artillery
up the streets

[Juvenile]
we left yo' brain sick
up with a chopper A.K. 47 splittin' the bricks
a young black crucifix
up in the dirt i be knockin' dicks
smooth and beretically, my pockets 
rocket 
to six figures
and polverizin' niggas
pullin'
A.K.'s and two triggers
my potn's stand on the side of me
they only come out at night
them deamons got me on a flight 
duck tapin' and takin' life
or even worse 
it could be three O'clock, on a Sunday by church
yo' brains might have to burst
you shouldn't have fucked with me first
since them bullets was cappin'
adam's apples i'm scoutin'
got richer penintentiary ward
for the national guard to come get 'em
very seldom do you see me, when you do
what do you do
bust back, better be a head shot
if not it's you
i'm comin' around the corner
'bout to pulla meatball on ya'
purses like a coat
and them houses in calico
me and Lil Turk heard of a merger 
on a murder
fifty G's grand on his head
what ht  fuck did you said
fifty G's grands for sure

[Turk]
I start to poppin'
niggas start to droppin'
i'm havin' fatal thoughts,i think i'm fuckin' shell shockin'
niggas bangin'
four-five ringin'
in my ear, i'm not scared
'cuz i'm a solja and solja's have no fuckin' fear
in my sleep at night
i'm seeing war fights
wakin' up thinkin' that a nigga took my fuckin' life
unnecessary shit
mind clickin' like a light switch
to pick you up on any nigga or any bitch
don't give a fuck
steady bangin' and dodgin'
camoulflagin'
with the mack alive and
don't have time for these dog hoes
goin' through a stage with that chop Chopper and that four-four

[Juvenile]
What's this shit i hear 'bout you boys potna's in crime
if that's true i'll punish you bitches for the last time
now you gon' shine
let me put somethin' on ya' mind
lil' cowards takin' hits
and protecting shit
it's a for sure thang
i'm a brang 
or i'm a wet ya
best to be 'bout yo' business, if not, God bless ya
look, what makes you think that two-two-six wasn't strong
that's when we do ya wrong
they both come and they gone
off-toppers
