[Juvenile]
You think this shit happened for me over tha night
This is my life
Everybody know I be on tha flight
To get it right, and keep it right, and stay strong
Nigga thought it wouldn't happen to 'em, but all of 'em dead wrong
Singin' tha same song, sayin', "Juvie ain't shit!"
With a project nigga out here tellin' people he rich."
When tha truth is:  they wishin' they was in my shoes
I pay dues, with them pistols I made moves
And I'm seein' all these pussy-ass niggas tryin' ta be hard
Why ya fuckin' with mines  I ain't fuckin' with y'all
Tha people runnin' your organization workin' for me, uh-huh
You didn't know that, now you call for tha plea
Boy, think of all tha places you could possibly be
Then,  these bullets  is comin' for me
With my T-shirt and Rees on
Cuz only God knows what these niggas be's on

[Chorus [Lil' Wayne]]
Look, niggas better get it right and keep it right
Cuz them Uptown Hot Boy$ on tha street at night
So I hope you got your soldiers and your 'Bauds on
Cuz we about ta strap up and know your clothes off
Whoa
You better get it right and keep it right
Cuz them Uptown Hot Boy$ on tha street at night
So I hope you got your soldiers and your 'Bauds on
Cuz we about ta strap up and knock your clothes off

[Lil' Wayne]
Listen, listen, listen
Sip it
Cock ta act a fool and make 'em dip it what
Chrome MAC diply what
Automatic spitty what
I'm a Hot Boy, nigga, follow me
Do or die, survive with me huh
Blow a pound of that broccoli huh
Hit a block and ya ride with me huh
Cut 'em all, but not your boy, he just had a baby daughter so
Then, Cita, he never walk again so
Don't play with them shots again oh
I make them niggas bleed like that time of tha month
See, I told 'em, "Nobody move; nobody head bust."
Plus, a hundred rush turn a boy ta dust
Nigga, I'm a soldier, trust
I'll blow a hole in your guts
And ain't no "if", "and's", or "but's" uh-uh
You could get mad and fuss uh-uh
Watch your lip, man, you'll touch uh-uh
I'll pop a clip in, and bust uh-uh
Look, I'm straight thuggin'
Lookin' at niggas' fake muggin'
I'm runnin' with niggas that stay sufferin'
That ain' nothin'
It's Weezy Weez
I show off behind cheese
Get full of trees

Niggas know I could get ugly when it come to that To that
Oh, for sure, I leave ya bloody if ya come for that For that

You got coke, keep it on tha low cuz I'll come for that For that

I was raised watchin' niggas shoot out with K's and shit Wha
My momma tried ta keep me inside, but I snuck out tha back Oh
Shot hookie from school, hung on V.L. and sold a lil' crack Fo sho'
Niggas respect me cuz they know my nuts be hangin'and swingin' Hangin'
If my toes get stepped on, I'm click-clackin' and bangin' Bangin'
I've been out here since I was, like, ten years old
Caught my first gun charge in nineteen-nine-four
Scuffed my knees up a lot, he pulled me out that
I'm out here now, and ain't no way that I'ma look back
Fresh layed tha track down, I picked tha pad up for a minute
Put tha gat down
But don't think I still won't act, busta

[Chorus [Lil' Wayne]]
Niggas better get it right and keep it right
Cuz them Uptown Hot Boy$ on tha street at night
