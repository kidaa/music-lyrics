[B.G. & Baby]
Cash Money slangin nine nigga
Off top playboy

What's happing little B.G. bring it to these niggas

[B.G.]
When I got that iron in my hand I'm going to slang it
When I got that drama on my mind I'm going to bring it
I ain't backing down from no nigga that's hatin
If the nigga say I ain't bout my buisness look here he hatin

[Baby]
Comin uptown playboy we gonna slang it 
If I catch down nigga bad we gonna leave ya stainin
Fuckin wit my H.B's nigga I'm gonna bring it
Rollin uptown stay strap and keep thinkin'

[B.G.]
Cause a nigga get stolen
Better yet get takin
Paper is burn
They come fast, ya cant shake it
Picture this my brother Cash Money done went nation
That come's from 7 hard years of dedication

[Manny Fresh]
Fuckin wit my B.G. nigga

That's believing worth six niggas
We call hard hitters
We uptown riders and we real with this nigga nigga

[B.G.]
Police can investigate but they ain't gonna find shit
But a 100 bullet shells without a fucking fingerprint
This Hot Boy click laid back and spy on niggas
We see them working on something look here we riders
Ain't like working niggas
Any block with a flussy
That goes for the boss too
We ain't got no picks to choose it
We get cha if we gotta
Wig split cha if we gotta
I know you ain't got word that B.G.'s a rider
So keep it on the D.L
If you got keys don't serve nobody but off V.L
'Cause they play for keeps 
A one way ticket to hizell 
6 ft. deep
It's a filthy dirty rizell
On the U.P.T
I was raised in the streets
But I put it on my mind 
By the time I was nine
I was pushin nigga 
I was slangin that nine

[Lil Wayne]
Na, Na, Na, Na
Now them them don't want us 
They know me and Turk don't fuss in the corners
They already know that we brothers, Blood 
Or whatever you wanna call it
Click up wit my dog we get crazy like alcholics
Plus we ballers
So whatever we spin the Lex or Benz
Its gonna be on twenny, twen, twens

[Turk]
Get off the block when we come nigga nigga
To the lane 
Shots that close shop when the bullets start sparying
Run your mouth too much, better watch what cha sayin
Like a nigga on the sideline, nigga we ain't playin

[Lil Wayne]
Na, Na, Na, Na
Now why O why Lord
The nigga wanna try and die Lord

[Turk] 
Niggaz wanna learn hard way
Give it to 'em like that
Make 'em suffer 
Put that bitch wit a bag

[Juvenile]
I guess you probably standin there sayin, "Who's the muthafucka"
Nigga Juv's the muthafucka, thata bruise a muthafucka
Either there's been a lot of cross-firing in the bricks
And I'm gonna  me nigga
If they put me in that shit 
Look I'm gonna tell ya like I tell my folks
Play with me if you want but Cash Money going broke
Even if it means creepin up slow 
Busting out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, 'cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no ho's
She could have had a girl for that
I been realized, I'm all in
Surrounded by the camoufalge, in ballin
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin, stop callin
Cause ain't no peace treaties wodie
You better leave that 45 at your house cause you gonna need it wodie
I told you boy, I'm a souljah boy
U.T.P up on my stomach from the Nolia boy
