Girl I been waitin' on this day 
bet you thought you never hear me say 
you been creeping around all over town 
been laying it down been messin' around 
what goes around always comes around 
Baby girl I thought we was down 
girl I hope you change your freaky ways 
'cause I really wanna stay 
tell me is he the best since I been there 
that I should share your underwear 
do you really think he cares 

Chorus 
All this time I've been sleeping with you 
you been sleeping with me 
you been stroking him and loving him 
and kissing him and hugging him 
oh why you've been creeping with him 
he's been sexing your friends 
not I got you thinking about it 
thinking about it thinking about it 
thinking about it 

Girl I think that I should let you know 
that I'm gonna have to up and go 
if you keep giving it up cutting up 
and acting fast giving up the ass 
I love you but I had enough 
do it again it's gonna be your last 
I can forgive but won't forget the 
things you did 
you'll soon regret ever dissin' me 
'cause this could be the end of we 
can't you see 
girl you're hurting me 

Repeat Chorus three times 

For the life of me I just can't conceive 
why I just can't leave you 
why you do this to me baby 
I feel like a fool 
but what can I do your love gots me weak baby 
why must I endure your constant greed 
your endles need to be so damn freaky 
now I understand 'cause it wasn't for me 
yes pay backs a mother baby 

Oh why tell me why whey are you so freaky 
tell me why, why are you so freaky 

Chorus 

Ad-lib
