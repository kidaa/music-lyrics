I been watchin' you and the way that you 
workin' your thang 
How can I be down, girl I want you know 
drop me a name 
See I gotta know, I need the dough, talk 
a lot ain't sayin' nothin' 
I can' go, know, know, know, know, know 

Chorus 
I been workin' my game baby, spending my 
change baby 
Ain't nothin' change baby, ya still 
actin' the same baby 
Where do I go baby, you keep tellin' me 
no baby, 
Said it's breaking my heart baby, it's 
breaking my heart baby 

Tell me what to do, just to get with you 
for a little while, just a little while, 
Satisfaction guaranteed, if you get with 
me girl I'll make you smile 

I know you know, know what I feel like 
Feel ya tryin' to get inside but it's too 
tight, something you can't buy 

Repeat Chorus two times 

The name "Shaqueen", I slide on the scene 
With ice and games for cats fiening to slide 
inbetween
My steeze far from easy, it's harder than 
you get 
Seein' me in ya head naked in the bed on some 
freaky triple x shit 
Words exit, through one ear and out the next, 
cuz I ain't with that sex shit 
And I barely know you, money can't get me to 
give it like hoes do 
That's how I keep it tight, so get it right 
You can't buy my love no matter the cost 
And the more you try to it's just the phatter 
I floss 
Just because you give me a ride, don't mean 
I'm a ride 
Or because you take me out, it's gonna help 
me decide 
And I ain't tryin' to play you and get you 
for yours 
But I just know you can't wait to get in my 
draws 
But if the time is right and your mind is 
right I might change 
But until then I'm a keep dissin' your game. 

Repeat Chorus two times
