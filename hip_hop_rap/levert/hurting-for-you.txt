Wake up in the morning I feel so empty 
'Cause nobody's there by my side 
Look through my window the sun's not shining 
The feeling of hurt I can't hide 

I get so helpless when I hear your voice 
My heart starts to skip a beat 
Baby I need to feel you just see your face 
When can we meet Baby I'll be discreet 

Look in my eyes can't you see Girl 
That I'm hurting for you 
These tears I've cried Girl should tell you 
That I'm hurting for you 

I go to dinner with other girls 
But all I seem to see is your face 
My friends try to amuse me but they just 
confuse me 
'Cause my head is in another place 

Just give me a chance maybe we can be friends 
I just need your company 
Oh for a little Baby I just need you around 
Say that you feel the same way about me 

Repeat 1 

There's not a thing that I wouldn't do for you 
I'll go as far as you want me to 
I'll give you all my time every day every hour 
With gifts of love I promise you I'll shower you 

Ad lib 

Repeat 1 two times 

Baby just understand I just want to be your man 
Let me be if I can Baby won't you take my hand 
Lead me away to somewhere new 
I just wanna spend time with you 
Baby why don't you be my girl 
I'll give you anything you want in the whole 
wide world 

Repeat 1
