Verse 
Girl I know I hurt you and I made you cry 
You still won't forgive me 
Though I said I'm sorry a thousand times 

Girl you're not an angle see you have faults too 
So why do you take me through the changes 
The changes that you do 

Just because I'm wrong 
It don't make you right 
Why can't we make love 
Instead of fuss and fight 

Repeat 1 

Girl I'm only human 
And I hate you feel this way 
You won't give me no lovin' 
Why you making me pay 
I would never treat you 

Treat you like you treated me 
If we're going to stay together 
You got to start forgiving me 
I gave my all to this relationship 
I tried to hold on Baby 

But you let the loving slip 
See if we're gonna make it last 
We got to sit down and talk 
'Cause Baby if we don't 
I'm gonna have to walk walk 

Repeat 1 three times 

See Babe I love you and 
I know that you love me 
But we can't we can't keep on arguing 
And fussing and fighting Baby 
So why don't you try to understand me 
Like i understand you 
Give me a chance Baby, give me a chance 
Understand what it is that I'm going through 

Repeat 1 three times
