I don't wanna be alone 
Yo I'll be there 
Same place same time 
I can't stand being without you 

As we lay face to face 
Sharing love in a temporary place 
I got a girl you got a man 
If they found out 

I'm sure they wouldn't understand 
See I can't keep myself from wanting you 
You see I wanna lay with you 
I wanna play with you I wanna stay with you

Chorus
Don't ask me how I can't say why 
Why we're here you and I 
At the same place at the same time 

Don't stop now don't let it end 
Girl we must do it again 
In the same way at the same time 

I want my cake eat it too 
Making love to her 
I wish I'm making love to you 
So here we are we know it's wrong 

Each moment without you 
Baby is too damn long 
There's no time to be wasting baby 
So let's slip away to our favorite place 

Chorus 

Make sure you got your pumps on 
When you come baby come along 
I swear I'm gonna keep it hot 
Come on give me all you got 
it's our secret 

Keeping it a secret nobody has to know 
The things that we do or the places we go 
You know what time of evening 

You know just where we meet 
It ain't nobody's business 
We're keeping it discreet 

chorus
