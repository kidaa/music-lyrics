What happened to the old records 
when it sounded like this 
what happened to the old records 
when it was strictly classics 

Repeat 

What's going on is what he once said 
guess nobody heard him 
and it's no better as days go by 
I'm gettin' fed up 
pain and misery is taking over me 
hungry babies unemployment lines people 
steady dying 
I'm getttin' my bags and I'm goning 
to the place that is no where 

Chorus 
I'm going going packin' my bags 
and going to no man's land 
I'm going going packin' my bags 
I'm going to no man's land 

Catching cases and during time I'm getting 
careless 
my baby's mama making me loose my mind 
gotta keep my head up 
the divorce rates running high ain't no 
family ties 
where's our future, chruches burning down, 
disease is spreading around 
I'm gettin' my bags and I'm going to a place 
where no man's land 

Chorus 

Sign of the times staring you in your face 
I must go on try to find a better place 

Repeat Chorus five times 

Ad-Lib 

Gotta get away find here go far from here 
fly away from here 
Gotta get away find here go far from here
