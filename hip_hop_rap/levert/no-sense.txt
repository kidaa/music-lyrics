It's Cleavland thang Gerald Levert, 
yeah 
A little Lazy Bone, Levert, Ken Dawg, 
let's do Columbus 
Levert and more Thugs 
united we stand divided we're fall 
sing with me yall 

Your love don't make no sense to me 
you get with me and you set me free 
baby your love don't make so sense, 
no sense 
your love don't make so sense to me 
you get with me and you set me free 
baby your love don't make no sense, 
no sense 

Girl I want to stay with you lay with 
you the whole night thru 
Girl I lose my self control when we 
roll the way that we do 
I ain't saying nothing we can play 
when ever I call 
baby don't be teasing me best believe 
that I want it all 
I can't believe that 

Chorus 
I can come and get it when I want it 
like this 
it's at my finger tips 
you look so god it don't make no sense 
no sense 
I can come and get it when I want it 
like this 
it's at my finger tips 
you look so good it don't make no sense 
no sense 

I mean it in a good way when people say 
your love is unreal 
ain't never had nobody to make me feel 
the way you make me feel 
I paged you 911 so I could see the sun 
from your window pane 
you may not understand wanna be your super 
man and you be my Lois Lane 
right now I can't believe that 

Chorus 

I'll be there by twelve so just prepare 
yourself for this good love 
I know you'll turn me out 
gonna make me scream and shout till I 
can't get enough 
Girl I'm a fean and you got the stuff 
I need to bring me down, down, down, 
I don't know what I'll do if I can't 
have you around 

Chorus 

Ain't no reason for the games that 
you play 
That's all that I really said the 
touch the clutch that's fillin' 
your head 
easing up out them underwear I'm really 
playing 
don't make so sense for me to be investing 
all this time 
if you gonna add to this list of all these 
folks trying to stress my mind 
I'm 'bout my grind you know that we gonna 
let that be that 
I hit your corner in about ten minutes just 
hit me right back 
hope to have a successful ending or is you 
just pretending 
girl it don't make so sense 
Girl if I can come in get it when I want it 
than let that be the reason that a Thug 
come by 
choosy lover undercover hustler Thugs need 
love no lie 
I want to sex you up can I freak you down 
Thug style 
flipping and turning and getting buck wild 
popping that thang as I watch you smile now 

Chorus
