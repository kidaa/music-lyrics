[Intro]
Here we are again 
In a different space 
In a different time 
I swore if I ever got the chance 
I wouldn't let you slip away, ha 
And I'll give you 
These things 

I want you to know how I feel about you 
If I move too slow, it's cuz I'm shy about you, yeah 
See I put you high on a pedistal 
I handle with care, I know you're fragile, baby 

There's so many things that I wanna say, yeah 
But I can't get past all your sexy ways, no 
I know you could have any man you wanted to 
So I'm taking this chance and I offer you baby, baby 

These things 
These arms 
These lips 
To feel you, to hold you, to kiss you oh 

These walls 
These eyes 
These sheets 
To keep you, to see you, to love you 

I ain't been one to open up, no, no 
But you come around and I'm an open book, yes I am 
My mental is taken to it's highest high 
You could talk me out of each and every dime, baby baby 
The physical thing, do we have to talk 
Girl you come around, I can't stand up straight and walk, no 
I know you could have any man you wanted to 
So I'm taking this chance, I'll bring you 

Repeat 1 

Don't have to have your hair done 
Your nails pressed, your face on, no red dress 
Just as you are, come to me 
I'll pleasure you exclusively 
I want you to grow with me 
Things I should learn with your mind showing me 
I'm all yours if you wanted me 
Baby girl, I'm offering 

Repeat 1 

Everything you need, everything you want 
Everything you need, baby 
Wanna show you what real love is really all about 
Let me tell you how baby 
Come on
