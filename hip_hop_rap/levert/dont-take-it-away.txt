For so long I've wanted to say 
You've changed the way I look at love 
And I pray you stay here by my side 
Cuz you see if you leave, forget existence 
I would rather die, you ask why 
Cuz when I'm with you I can fly 
Baby, I can touch the sky 

Don't take it away, no 
Take your love away from me 
Don't take it away, no 
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep 

You'll be takin' my sunshine, rainbows 
You don't wanna do that girl 
It'd be like takin' away a baby's 
Ice cream, sprinkles 
And I know you're not that kind of girl 

You never said that you had plans to leave me 
But I thought I tell you while 
I had the chance and a love this strong 
For so many ways, it was too late 
To express the happiness 
Don't know what to do 
After the love is gone 
They can't even carry on 

Repeat 1 

See with you I'm complete 
Girl, you are so sweet 
Nothing can compare to you being there 
You see, girl you know that I'll respect you 
I never would neglect my responsibility to love you 
So don't take it from me, no 
No, no, no, no 
Don't take it away 
Don't take it away 

Repeat 1 
Repeat 1
