No I'm not the blame 
I'ts not my fault you change 
girl I'm still the same man 
who gave you everything you

I remember days gone by 
I would be there when you cried

that you could 'cause me such 
grief you change girl yeah

all this guilt on me it ain't fair girl 
and I gotta let you know 

Chorus 

When I was out just being a man 
girl you didn't understand you 
accused me yeah you did 
of going out to do you wrong everday 
the same old song you confused me 
So now I'm standing in disbelief 
that you could cause me so much grief 
you changed girl yeah 
and now you have the tendency to place 
all this guilt on me 
it ain't fair girl and I gotta let you 
know 

Chorus 

Tell me what can I do to make you happy 
now that I tried and I can't get by
