Speech 
Her night lights up 
They're playing our favorite slow jam 
I tip the D.J. say play it again Sam 
'Cause I know that you know that I wanna 
do you 
Rub you down with hot oils into you 
I call it love you call it a sin 
But when I'm finished you say do it again 
Girl, you like it I ain't mad 
That's because I just wanna be bad 

I'm tired of playing games 
You always say the same old things 
Come on let's be for real 
You know how good I'll make you feel 
Come on Baby 

I wanna be bad tonight 
Let's do it Baby 
Be naughty so naughty 
I wanna be bad tonight 
Oh let's be naughty 

I'll kiss you from head to toe 
I'll show you things you never been shown 
Just come and stay awhile 
I swear I'll have you wearing a smile 
Come on Baby 

Repeat 1 

I wanna keep you satisfied 
I wanna make you feel good 
No matter how hard, how hard you try 

Girl give me this chance 
I wanna show you what it feels like 
To have a true romance 

Repeat 1 

I wanna be bad tonight 
Come on come on Baby 
Be naughty so naughty 

Speech 
Champagne whatever you desire 
Lie on the floor I'll put logs on the fire 
I'll break out strawberries and whip cream 
Can you imagine it like a dream 

So put on your sexy lace and sweet perfume 
And I'll put on my certain Fruit of the Loom 
So baby be ready when I come to your hotel 
No more Mr. Nice Guy it's time to be bad 

Ad lib 

Repeat 1 

I wanna be bad tonight 
Be naughty so naughty 
I wanna be bad tonight your ecstasy 

Ad lib 

Repeat 1
