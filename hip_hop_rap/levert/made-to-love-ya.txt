Verse 1 

I recalled when we first met, a long 
time ago. How could I forget the way 
I felt, when I first laid eyes on 
you. I remember saying to my friends, 
there is my future wife; and then, I 
took the steps to meet someone who 
would change my life. 

It had to be my destiny

Chorus:

Cuz, I was made to love ya/my hands 
to touch ya/my arms to hold ya/my legs 
to stand/my time to spend,with you 
forever. I was made, made to love ya. 
My lips to kiss ya/my eyes to see 
you/my legs to stand/my time to spend 
with you forever and ever. I was made 
[I was made] made to love ya [made to 
love ya.] 

Verse 2 

I remember our first date, our first 
argument. Our very first break up to 
make up, that got us to this moment. 
And every girlfriend and every one 
night stand, every heartbreak, every 
heartache, led me to ya, it drove me 
to ya, made me better, better suited 
for ya. 

Repeat Chorus:
