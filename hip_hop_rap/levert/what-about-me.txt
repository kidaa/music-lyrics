They say a man can be the coldest coldest 
thing on earth 
but nothing hurts like a woman 
with dreams that don't involve you 

What happened to all my dreams 
you just trade them in for material things 
just because your friends said you deserve 
your own 
how could you let them break up our happy home 
bags are packed and you're on your way 
this has got to be the saddest day 
can I change your mind girl I'm hurting inside 
can I change your mind don't think I'll survive 
wihtout you baby 

Chorus 
What about how I feel 
What about me 
what about all our plans 
I guess you don't give a damn 
what about me 
what about me 

You say you still love him but you gotta go 
if this is waht love is I don't want no more 
I'm begging you to change your mind 
or do you get a thrill out of a grown man crying 
I never thought I'd see the day when you up and go 
away 

Chorus 

We laid up in the bed remember the things we said 
we'd be together until we're dead 
you let your friends get into your head 
it's never too late to turn things around 
you said love was true and you'd always be down 

Chorus
