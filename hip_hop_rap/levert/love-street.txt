Welcome to this lonely 
man's life 
Every time I try to love 
It just don't seem 
To come out right 

And it seems kinda 
funny 
'Cause I always give 
my all 
One minute I'm on top 
of the world 
And the next I seem to fall 

I wanna be loved and give love 
Wanna make other people mad 
Nothing or no one can break us up 
We would be something they wish they 
had 

Somebody holler if you're feeling 
The way that I feel now 
'Cause I'm ready and I'm willing 
Girl I won't let you down 

Chorus 
You can find me on need of Love Street 
You can find me on need of Love Street 
You can reach me on need of Love Street 
That's where I'll be need of Love Street 

See I'm tired of talking to myself 
I need someone to talk to 
And I wanna go through the changes 
That people in love do 

See success is nothing baby 
Without someone to share it with 
And having someone in my life 
Would be the greatest gift 

See I'm ready to relax and settle down 
Someone to share my secrets with 
When there's no one else around 
Somebody to tell me 
When I'm right and when I'm wrong 
I'll have someone to sing about 
When I sing a love song 
So if you feel the same way baby 

There's no need in anticipating 
I'll be standing on the corner 
Ready willing and able 

Chorus
