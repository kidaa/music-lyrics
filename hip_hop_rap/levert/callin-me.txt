Three o'clock in the morning 
And the phone begins to ring 
Ya say you're feelin' kinda horny 
And only I can fulfill your needs 

Girl, I'm thinkin' 'bout it 'bout it 
And I'm tired, ain't had no sleep, no

Take out them chocolate covered cherries 
And go to work like they were me, yeah 

Can't resist the temptation 
So you know I'm on my way 
I hope you're ready when I get there 
Gonna slide inside and play, oh yeah 

We can do it in the kitchen, on the kitchen floor 
Take it to the bathroom, up against the door 
Move it to the bedroom, we can freak some more 
You'll ride me like a see-saw up and down 
Girl you got me spinnin' like a merry-go-round 
Girl I'm soakin' wet, I'm about to drown 
I'm about to drown in your love, baby
