What do you have to do 
what homework do you have to do 
spelling and math 
So why aren't you at home doing your homeowork 
why didn't you do your homework cause you wanted me to come here 
and and 

Sometimes my ego gets in the way 
I don't say I love you when I should say 
it ain't your fault I had a bad day 
for your happiness is why I pray 

Chorus 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
hope that you are proud of me 
if I should die before I wake 
remember all these words I'm saying 
Your smile your face is all that it takes 
is all that it takes to humble me 
your smile your face is all that it takes 
is all that it takes to humble me 

When I look into your eyes I think that 
I'm a lucky guy 
to know someone like you will always be 
apart of my life 
knowing that I taught you well I picked 
you up when you fell 
And no one else can tell you that but 
you I won't be there 
I know you are the future times heart 
of the sure end 
and that is why it make me respect you more 

Repeat Chorus three times 

I love you forever will always be together 
sang sang sang will well that was good that 
was good 
thank you anything you want to say 
anything you want to say to your fans thank 
you everybody 
for what for loving me 

Chorus
