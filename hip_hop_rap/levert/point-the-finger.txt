Sit down little brother let's talk awhile 
I know you're going through the same 
thang I'm going through 
But that's the changes that love put 
you through 
put you through put you through 
said it ain't the same she's calling 
you out your name 
looking through your clothes and thangs 
don't trust you like she used too 
everything going wrong she's pointing 
the finger at you 
I've been lying and I'm cheating sleeping 
round with everyone 
there's no future I'm gonna lose her 
I'm only out to have some fun 
I'm gonig to choke her and smoke her 
I need to get my head right 
but it's funny when you need money 
than I'm the kind of man you like 

Chorus 
Remember when you point the finger 
three is pointing back at you 
and all the actuation you been makin' 
is probably something you would do 

Chorus 

Say I ain't working I'm just jerking 
can't miss the Jerry Springer show 
no home training just complaining 
about songs that's on the radio 
always dreaming about singing 
how I'm gonna be a super star 
I'm going places I'm gonna make it 
and I even got no car 

Repeat Chorus two times 

Ad-Lib 
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da 
Da Da Da Da Da Da 
might be your lady your best friend 
lady yeah yeah 
can I get my brother to sing 
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da 
Da Da Da Da Da Da 
might be your lady lady 
or somebodies else's lady 
your best friend neighbor yeah 

Chorus
