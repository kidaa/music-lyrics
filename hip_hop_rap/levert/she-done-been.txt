[Intro] 
You brotha's 
Ya'll forget you got a mama 
Got a lady that stick with you through thick and thin 
But you dog her 
And you ain't been through half the shit she been 

You step in the church 
Every morning, six A.M., up from work 
Daddy always kept it real 
Taught you how a man s'pose to feel 
Not afraid to cook and clean 
Ain't even into the party scene 
But no matter what you do 
Every man that you meet 
Want his cake and eat it too 

1 - She been lied to, cheated on 
The victim of every sad song 
Her mother and her father 
Definition of the perfect daughter 

But she can't find a man 
Who done been half the things 
She done been 

If you out there raise your hand 
Raise your hand 
Check it out 

You like the thought of makin love 
Occassional kisses and a few hugs 
Want a family, raise some kids 
Just like your mamma and your daddy did yeah 
But every guy you start to dig 
Comes with baggage and no gig, yeah 
Got no kind of a job 
Got a baby mama, and alot of bills 
You foot the bill, but he come and go at will 

Repeat 1 

Said, give your baby a standing ovation 
Got her own college education 
Raise her babies all alone 
Always in a house but never at a home 

Repeat 1 

24 hours in labor She done been 
She been abused by her man She done been 
Out there on welfare She done been

Scrappin up dollas to get the baby lunch She done been

Ya'll don't seem to understand She done been 
You don't seem to understand She done been 
Call bitches and hoes for no reason She done been 
Getting raped on by the man she was pleasin' She done been
