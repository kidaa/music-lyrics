Kelly: 
Candle light and chocolate kisses 
Calls to say you missed me when we started 

Gerald: 
Your nails was done, your hair was pressed 
I miss the way you used to dress 
When I met you 
I really do 

Kelly: 
I gave my best 4 years, my time was wasted 

Gerald: 
See I shared your fears, and the tears you cried I tasted 

Kelly: 
Baby, I loved your kids, opened up my home. Yes I did 

Gerald: 
Paid your mama's bills. Gave you all when 
you had nothing. 

Chorus 
Love you so, can't let go. 
Never thought I'd be without you 
Can't imagine life without you 
walk away, everyday. 
Told me that you'd never leave. 
But now you say it hurts too much to stay. 

Kelly: 
Too much to stay 

Gerald: 
Said it's hard for me 
Your lover's stayin with his mom 
Tell me was it worth the drama oh baby 
See we got our own kids yeah 

Kelly: 
If there had to be another. 
Why go trick'n in the gutter 
And drivin our sh.... mmmmmm 
boo baby 

Gerald: 
See I know he can't put that thang down like I do. 

Kelly: 
Baby that was the past. You don't roll like you used 

Gerald: 
Said what's my motivation 
Girl I'm better off alone. 

Kelly: 
Tell me why can't we just walk away. 

Gerald and Kelly: 
Why are we so torn? 

Chorus 

Both: 
Never meant to hurt you. 
G: you walk away from me 
tell me why did you change 

Kelly: 
Can't it be all that we have hoped and prayed for 
now its gone away 

Gerald: 
Oh baby, everything. Our hopes and dreams they are 
no longer. We can't go back the way it used to be 
said now really. 

Chorus 

Gerald: 
Tryin to make you understand that I only just a man 

Kelly: 
Going to jail cause I kill yo girl 
Going to jail cause I kill yo girl 

Gerald: 
Come on now don't do this now 
come on now don't do this now 

Kelly: 
Your body belongs to me 
She can't have you no matter what she thinks 
No no no no no no no no no
