How come you look so sad 
You got me feeling bad 
'Cause I know that I can make you happy 
Don't want to see you blue 
But you won't give me a chance 

The guys that you hang around 
Just try to bring you down 
And I don't like it at all 
Girl give my love a try 
I'll keep you satisfied I promise you 

Girl I adore you I'll do anything for you 
You oughtta be with me 
Girl I need you I'll try my best to please you 
Can't you see you oughtta be with me 

When you come home at night 
I'll make you feel so right 
See this is waht I'll do 
I'll run your bubble bath 

Massage you with these big strong hands 
Wouldn't you like that Baby 
Kiss you from head to toe 
Because I want you so 

I'm telling you the truth Baby 
And after all of the above 
We'll make real serious love 
Can't you see you wanna be with me 

Repeat 1 two times 

Check this out nobody would do you like I 
would do 
I got a special kind of whip appeal 
Kiss it rub it flip it over 
Remember Baby I'm your Casanova 

So forget the other brother he's nothing but 
a zero 
And dial my number let me be a hero 
Girl Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder could tell 
That you really oughtta be with G. 

You see you oughtta be with me 
The G.E.R. and the A.L.D. 
The L.E.V.E.R. and the T. 
You really oughtta be with me 

Ad lib 

Repeat 1 

Ad lib
