Never thought you bring me so much pain 
Lord knows I tried to keep you happy girl 
in ever way 
out on the road doing my thang trying to 
keep you laced 
trying to keep a smile upon your face girl 
was all my happiness in vain 
or did I place in you a little too much faith 
now nothing but memories 
never though that this would be the price I 
had to pay 

Chorus 
You took my heart you took my car you took 
my crib 
got the nerves to take my kids 
got the nerves to take my kids 
you took my love and my life 
girl you took my soul 
taking everything from me 
taking everything from me 
you took my heart girl you took my car 
and you took my crib trying to take my kids 
girl you took my love than you took my soul 
taking everything everything everything 
everything everything 

And now I'm sitting all alone 
trying to figure out where you and I went 
wrong 
you know it makes me wanna cry 
just thinking about it makes me wanna lay 
down and die 
for the life of me I don't know how 
that you could take for granted and disregard 
our sacred vows 
now nothing but memories 
never though that this would be the price I 
had to pay 

Chorus 
You took my heat girl you took my cars 
trying to take my crib 
got the nerve to take my kids 
got the nerve to take my kids 
and take my love an my life 
girl you took my soul 
you've taking everything from me 
taking everything from me 
you took my heart my pride 
my crib my kids my love my soul 
everything everything everything 
everything everything everything 

Now I ain't never been no fool 
I've always tried to keep my cool 
I was faithful to you never abuse you or 
use you 
even though sometimes you make me want to 
but I love you 
you should try to understand girl that I 
was your man 
my life was in your hands baby was shinning 
over everything 
now you're gone and I'm just gonna be a 
weekend Daddy baby 
can I call you baby or is that just a passing 
thing 

Chorus
