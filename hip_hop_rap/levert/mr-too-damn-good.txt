Guess you never know a good thing 
When it's right in your face 
you've been abused for so long 
Love gets tainted and it all seems the same 
I guess it's unbelievable 
Someone could love you like this 
Well time ain't no object and money ain't a thing 
When you have someone to ease the pain 

Let me be the smile on your face 
And be your stars and your moon 
I wanna be your sunny day 
Can I be your favorite tune? 
I wanna be your breakfast in bed 
And baby I'll be your fool 
Mr. Too Damn Good To You 

Yes sir, hmm 
you've been hurt so many times 
You don't when love's for real 
So you don't open up 
Or give in to love 
Or express how you feel 
But just like Sunday Morning 
I take it easy 
Girl I'm gonna wait 
Cause love it just ain't right 
Without you by my side 
Baby you're my soul mate 
Baby I'll open doors 
Be there for you any time 
Cause that's what your man's supposed to do 
I wanna cook for you 
I will spoil you 
Girl my whole objective is to please you 
I'll run your bubble bath 
Make you laugh 
Girl through thick and thin I got your back 
I ain't gon be pressin' you or stressin' you to make love 
We got so much time for that 

Repeat 1 

Baby, baby 
I wanna be your shoulder when you need one to cry on 
Hmm-hmm yeah 
I wanna be your pillow when you need one to lie on, oh yeah 
I wanna be the spot light that shines on ya 
Girl I wanna write the girl is mine on ya, yes I am 
I wanna be your thought in your daydreams 
I wanna be your everything, your everything 
Mr. Too Damn Good To You 
I wanna be everything you ever thought you wanted 
Mr. Too Damn Good To You 
Ever needed baby, yeah 
Girl I wanna shout about it 
You wanna tell the world about it 
Mr. Too Damn Good To You 
And can't nobody else believe me 
Youll have everything you've needed, yeah, yeah 
Mr. Too Damn Good To You 
I'm gonna be so so good to you
