Girl who you been talking to 
Tell me whose been lying to you 
They say I'm cheatin' doing this and that 
Why you frontin' girl 
Now you know it ain't like that 

You know I cherish our relationship 
In the middle of the night 
Get up and buy a bag of chips 
Just to keep you satisfied 
If I'm doin' wrong Lord knows I'm tryin' 

Tell me what it is tell me what can I do 
To make you understand 
I'm crazy 'bout you I can't do without you 

You got me whipped and I slipped 
I must be trippin' I'm so proud 
To say I'm your man 

Chorus 
Absolutely positively 
Girl I love you please don't doubt me 
Take me in your arms and rock me all nite long 

Absolutely positively 
Girl I love you please don't doubt me 
Take me in your arms and rock me all night long 

Tell me what you want me to do 
I spent my whole life lookin' for you 
So I consider you forever mine 
Those who don't like it 
Kiss where the sun don't shine 

Girl I'll be there through the thick and thin 
When you can't even find your so called friends 
So let me be the one you talk to 
Whatever probelm we can slove 'em 
Between me and you 

Repeat Chorus two times 

Rock me rock me all nite long baby 
Rock me rock me all nite long baby 

Chorus
