Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood
Aint nothin' changed, still holla at my homies Ohhhhhhhhh
And when I hit the block I still, will kill!
And I don't want, nigga but I will If I got to, kill!
If niggas get to fuckin' around

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah!
Respect come from admiration or fear
You can admire me or you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toasters right on my lap
So If a nigga get outta line, a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal of infiltry, I'm built for this mentally
Thats why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I will be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Hecklar Koch should tear have of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain, when I unless the pain
Get the message from my lines or get the message from the .9's
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga, watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same tI'me, yeah!

[Akon: Chorus]
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood
Aint nothin' changed, still holla at my homies Ohhhhhhhhh
And when I hit the block I still, will kill!
And I don't want, nigga but I will If I got to, kill!
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around...

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah!
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I got creepin' through the hood wearin' teflon
Hit the corners mother fuckers get left on
Niggas know If not they better check my background
Try and stick me, Ill fill your back with mac rounds
Ask Preme nigga 50 don't back down
I kick it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me, I wanna know what thats 'bout
Nigga I know you aint mad, I done came up
And If you are, fuck you 'cause I aint changed up
The O.G's wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I aint did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my tI'me, get it 'cause I grind
All across the globe like the worlds mine Yeah!

[Akon: Chorus]
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood
Aint nothin' changed, still holla at my homies Ohhhhhhhhh
And when I hit the block I still, will kill!
And I don't want, nigga but I will If I got to, kill!
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around...

[Verse 3: Akon]
Konvict!
Now tell me have you ever looked up in the distance
And seen a mac aI'min' at your head mayne
Before you know it, life is flashin', reminiscin and your body is drippin' and full of lead
Mayne
I done been there Uh huh, I done cocked that Uh huh, It aint ever been a question I'm bout
That
Don't go there, you'll get cocked at, and if you plan to fuck around and rewrite that
You'll never catch me ridin' around on these streets, with all the couple metal pieces under
My feet
Fully automatic weapons and know it was done deeds
Smash up under the carpet like a Tennessy breeze, but 50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Hey
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas, 50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I been long gone like the ripper, soooo..

[Akon: Chorus]
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood
Aint nothin' changed, still holla at my homies Ohhhhhhhhh
And when I hit the block I still, will kill!
And I don't want, nigga but I will If I got to, kill!
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around...
