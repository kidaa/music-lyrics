
January, I fell to the cobblestone 
In April, I cut little paper flowers 
In August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome 
In October, I was introduced as coward 
I love New York Saturdays 
But Mondays last longer 
And since I plan to live a long life 
Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn 
To merge the week for all its got 
To get my shoddy rotten ribs stick, forgot my ribs 
I got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull 
And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage 
I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle 
And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel 
Then I settle in a stand still 
I live forever reaching for the sun 
Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a hand full 
Rope ladder, I'ma swing in ample 
And I wanna turn scullies and summings with pretty lullabye, bye 
The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal 
I never felt so damn young 
But you don't look a day over zero 
And you don't look a day in the times cuz it'll make you realize 
The night is near so 
Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges 
I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges 
I never really knew the true definition of precious 
Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave it a message 
I'm a fully animated life tree 
See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song 
Of I'm a fully animated life tree 
With branches for the heavens to admire actually 

[Chorus Woman speaking]
Fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine 
Cringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate 
Destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem 
Health, pain, sex, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time 

We all know what a halo is 
But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips 
I be themanadome[?] making your pretty little heels click 
I be the Sword in the Stone of the contemporary eclipse 
I'm incredibly exhausted 
You can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete 
Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning 
Better stay competitive, meter in such to bust, fuckin fantastic 
Every little steps you take breaks the chamber 
In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble 
Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour 
Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour 
I ain't been around the world but I been around the block 
I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk 
I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ 
I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice 
I wanna weeble well, I wanna set of knitting needles 
Villain with a theme dream silent 
Paddle in the hole in the bottom divy to where the portraits astonish 
You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise 
Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate 
I make a true spur of the moment grown decision 
Which in turn allows me to be something normal 
With the prefix of the abbot 
I can kill every monster if I got it, that's that 
Rockin it, rockin it, clippership rockin it 
Be the little guinea pig, dig? 
I'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water 
No splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch 
It's like that 

[Chorus 2x]
