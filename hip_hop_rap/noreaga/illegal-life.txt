	if the game's in you, dedicated stay true
	Illegal Life
[Noreaga] Yo, I was in Vermada, laid up with gold saga
	jungle room, cowboy hat around June
	Monaga, had the 45th draga, Capone-N-Noreaga
	the saga, sega, mega, network and bodega
	dream marvelous, scandelous, black mantis
	Illegal life is like my aerolight,
	we be your light, hustle night to life
	desert storm, and cold form on your norm
        run through, hard-boil you like John Woo
	the law we hate, drop a cake cut like mix tape
	spoil coke plate, you buying fake weight
	the next state, contemplate and score jake hesus
	conduce, claim bishop in juice, bloody up your goose
	now who screamed for truce, Lefrak is Iraq
	Illegal life contract, keep 'em back, load up the big macs
[Havoc] Chorus 2x
[Capone] We hate the law, escalated war with jake, raise the crime rate
	criminal minds regulate the tri-state,
	the legacy it never end, illegal life veteran salute 
	get loot and stay true, corupt jake make it happen
	snatch 'em catching O Z's, put the game on freeze
	dedicated hustling won't stop regardless
	whatever charges, getting the dough til you go,
	observation, direct sale, connects giving, reaching for ceiling
	on the streets again, wild born, the enemy became your best friend
	meet the game closer, maped out many ways to get rich
[Havoc] Ay yo, for real crime pays
[Capone] 9 6 the deal, we real about this cheddar, forever
	corner standing, in any weather, heat holding you down
	controlling your ground, stick-up kids come around
	and taste the pound, CNN, put our soul on the line
	for this life of crime, 2 5 forever shine

 	while the streets change, me and my man remain tough ly
