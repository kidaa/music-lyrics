Breaking out this stifled room
A jail cell, a stell tomb
To see the light
My mere existence
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness

Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time
Breaking out this stifled room
A jail cell, a stell tomb
One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness

Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted [X2]

Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!

Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted

One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time
