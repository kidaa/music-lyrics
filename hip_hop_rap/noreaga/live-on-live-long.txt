In days like these we find ourselves searching for answers
A lack of faith eating us to the bone, like a cancer
And will you be there when it's over
And will you be there when it all comes down
And will you be there when it's over
And will you be there when it all comes down
It's too late to change what has happened
Try to decide your reaction
Cause it's too late to change what has happened
Try to decide your reaction
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
Faith in who we are
In times like these we need the eyes of the future
To deliver the fate of man can we all be saved and not wither
And will you be there when it's over
And will you be there when it all comes down
And will you be there when it's over
And will you be there when it all comes down
It's too late to change what has happened
Try to decide your reaction
Cause it's too late to change what has happened
Try to decide your reaction
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
Faith in who we are
It's too late to change what has happened
Try to decide your reaction
Cause it's too late to change what has happened
Try to decide your reaction
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
And I see, but I'm blinded
And I see, but my fate still finds me
Faith in who we are
