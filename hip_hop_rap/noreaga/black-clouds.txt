[Intro: N.O.R.E.]
Yea niggas always asking questions man 
Like why y'all niggas so wild 
Y'all niggas go everywhere, shotouts, fights, things going on man 
Y'all niggas doing y'all thing, getting a little paper man 
Why ya'll niggas can't stay out of trouble man 
It's like black clouds be following us man 
Time for ya'll niggas to get to know Nore 

[N.O.R.E.] 
Niggas wanna know yo what's wrong with the god 
Cause every other day it's on with the god 
Every week a different beef 
Yea and my niggas cock guns and buy them for cheap 
Shotouts in front of here and there let's be clear 
And we done sent niggas to intensive care 
You see guns no problem, beef is no problem 
Niggas start snitching, thats weak, thats a problem 
I stay quiet, and don't talk to the press 
Fuck a courtroom, I'm good on the street with tec's 
Nigga Deuce locked, he got 15 years like booth 
He just went up, shit got me bent up 
It's time to celebrate, but wait my niggas ain't here 
My father ain't here, Pun ain't here, 
It don't seem like life treating me fare 
I drink Henny, it's stronger than that Belvedere 

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.] 
Black clouds over my head, follow my lead 
Waking up in the morning beer and weed 
Why the fuck it seems like, it's so hard to breath 
Why the hood seems like it's hard to leave 
We been waiting on this money for quite so long 
And my niggas on the run now, way to long 
Black clouds go away for the rest of the day 
Black clouds just go away, don't fuck up the day 

[N.O.R.E.] 
I make good music, and thats the reason I sold 
Through out platinum albums, and shit went gold 
I can't stress this cause god, I'm on the guest list 
Feeling like Xzibit, straight restless 
When it's my turn to blow, and own the cable 
I sold eight hundred thou on the penalty label 
And man shit deep, I ain't reach my peak 
It's my fifth album, ain't none of it weak 
I admit Melvin Flynt my soul wasn't there 
Recording in the studio, mind wasn't clear 
Said had to backup blunts and skunks 
No quotables still ain't get rhyme of the month 
Black Clouds follow me, like where ever I go 
Even when I ain't stressed, and I'm ready to flow 
I just let go, just let me know 
It's going be a better day, my seeds is celo 

[Chorus] 

[Complextions] 
Black clouds go away 
You been on slime back like everyday 
Everytime I turn around, you bringing drama my way 
I don't know how I deal with beef today 
 Black clouds  it seems you always with me 
Can't get no paper unless you there with me 
Can't go nowhere unless you there with me 
I don't even care, who else is there with me 
Black clouds go away 
You been on slim back like everyday 
Everytime I turn around, you bringing drama my way 
I don't know how I deal with beef today 
 Black clouds  it seems you always with me 
Can't get no paper unless you there with me 
Can't go nowhere unless you there with me 
I don't even care, who else is there with me 

[Chorus]
