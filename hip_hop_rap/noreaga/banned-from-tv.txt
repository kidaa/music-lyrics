Hey there now young Willy
Swing alone, quote the scriptures
Keep them guessing which bed you crawled from
Justify, just deny
Was it fun
Your time has come
What have you done
What have you done

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chiming
Every chorus the machine of god
Is singin'.

It's the poison that it measures
Brings illuminating vision
It's the knowing with a wink
That we expect in Southern women
It's the wolf that knows which sheep to dip to save itself
It's the octopus that crawled back to the sea.

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chiming
Every chorus the machine of god
Hey.....

Hammered shooting plywood in the backyard
Laughin' 'cause the racket makes the blackbird sing
Like the holy terror
Suck the marrow from the bone
Singe, you're always burning books
You got the chorus and the ring

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chiming
Every chorus the machine sings.

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chiming
Every chorus the machine sings.

That's when the calibration brittle
As a stick hits you, the gold ring and the time museum
Cheaper than a link of gold rings
Gold ring.

Sing, sing, sing, sing.
