We gon thug this shit out

And say bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
We gon thug this shit out

And say bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
And throw your sets up nigga
Gang bang, bang bang
We keep long gats and big chains
I don't like havin sex, I like brains
And smoke some spliff, fans wit five in the range
And it's, nuthin for me, and shit on your three
I'm from Iraq, twenty minutes from Q.B.
I aim you, so you should just let us be
Or find yourself shot up, in the hospati
You be leakin, and Dole in ya face, some hot teeth
Yo it's Nore, but you can call me P.O.P.
And getta dose of the dope, but dope is so deep
Only white girl I'll fuck, is Pamela Lee
And I'm gangsta, so some niggas call me G
Melvin Flynt, hustlin was born in me
So yo bitch, come and do a poor? wit me
Or come to North Carolina and perform wit me
We gon thug this shit out
We gon thug this shit out
And say bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
We gon thug this shit out
We gon thug this shit out
And say bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang

Yo, yo, yo
I'ma take it back to when I used to pop pistals
Sling crystal, gamble on the block with pits out
Kept my work in bitch house, right in the closet
I won't front I'll bring the drama nigga, right to the projects
When it's cold, I remain the hottest
I bring the thug niggas, is you booshi?
I leave blood, all in your protis
Niggas life styles deserve Oscars, you so funny
Claim you kingpin - and ain't even fuckin wit hoe money
I'm gangsta, been in jail once, check my records
I keep the stash grip wit arma, before I select my weapons
This young mind state, crime infested, I'ma get straight to the message
I spit records, and rep my necklace
Do the dog want beef?  Right where the steps is
I walk the hood, niggas pay homage cause of my essence
It ain't nuthin, I catch any charge, get out on bail
Fuck record, this shit was platinum when it touched the reel

We gon thug this shit out

And say bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
We gon thug this shit out
We gon thug this shit out
And say bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
[Foxy Brown]
Hot damn hoe, here we go again
Pop shit like a cock, +Lyte+ weight as your +Rocks+, bitch
You talk slick, fuck is all that sneak shit? 
You and Diddy y'all kill me with that subliminal shit, bitch
Why is you frontin and kickin that street shit?
Please, impress me, go back to that freak shit
While your broke-ass was guzzlin nuts and shit
I was choppin the weights, Linc and Oldz's and shit
A decoy bitch, like the Feds lyin
Is you supposed to have a little bitta Bed-Stuy in ya?
Brooklyn don't raise hoes, just slip, and greys hoes
What bitch? You're soft and your pussy name hoes
So fuck ya niggas too, them niggas can get it too
Them faggots act more bitch then you 
Let the nigga rest in peace, and hop off his dick, bitch do you
And ya'll hoes is like ";Fuck Fox,"; well screw ya'll too
Let's be truthful, give a fuck if your album push back
Or when it hit the streets, bitch, it's still weak
It still sound lame, my name still reign
I still pop them thing things, and bang bang, bitch, rep for ya hood
