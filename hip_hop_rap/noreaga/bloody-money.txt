[Egyptian Guards]

Mud...Sand...Water...Straw...Faster!

Mud...And lift...Sand...And Pull

Water...And raise up...Straw...Faster!

[Slaves]

With the sting of the whip on my shoulder

With the salt of my sweat on my brow

Elohim, God on high

Can you hear your people cry:

Help us now

This dark hour...

Deliver us

Hear our call

Deliver us

Lord of all

Remember us, here in this burning sand

Deliver us

There's a land you promised us

Deliver us to the promised land...

[Yocheved]

Yal-di ha-tov veh ha-rach

My good and tender son

Al ti-ra veh al tif-chad

Don't be frightened and don't be scared

My son, I have nothing I can give

But this chance that you may live

I pray we'll meet again

If He will deliver us

[Slaves]

Deliver us

Hear our prayer

Deliver us

From despair

These years of slavery grow

too cruel to stand

Deliver us

There's a land you promised us

Deliver us

Out of bondage and

Deliver us to the promised land...

[Yocheved]

Hush now, my baby

Be still, love, don't cry

Sleep as you're rocked by the stream

Sleep and remember my last lullaby

So I'll be with you when you dream

River, o river

Flow gently for me

Such precious cargo you bear

Do you know somewhere

he can live free?

River, deliver him there...

[Young Miriam]

Brother, you're safe now

And safe may you stay

For I have a prayer just for you:

Grow, baby brother

Come back someday

Come and deliver us, too...

[Slaves]

Deliver us

Send a shepherd to shepherd us

And deliver us to the promised land

[Yocheved]

Deliver us!
