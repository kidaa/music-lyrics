everything you touch turns into gold
got everything you want at 24
so what do you do
when all your dreams come true
what do you believe in
there's nothing left to want
so who do you blame when nothing is wrong
and what do you do
all your dreams
when all your dreams come true

are you feeling lucky are you feeling lost
was it all too easy now how do you get it off
cause your train won't stop
now all your dreams came true
