We came from somewhere
we got out smooth like heaven sent
I got to nowhere
you made it everywhere you went
everywhere you went
we spoke in silence
we saw what we were supposed to see
we talked thru mirrors
you build your dreams but not for me
Oh, I just stay dead
I just stay dead
I just stay dead
like sun to the colours I fade
We head for something
we picked up flowers in the flow
we ran together
you ran too fast, I ran too slow
Oh, I just stay dead
I just stay dead
I just stay dead
Like sun to the colours I fade
for you I will enter my getaway
24 hours of sun, here today
a million days later of drowning in rain
and I don't believe in the needle you gave
I run to the ground
I stay in this room behind curtains
I listen to the sounds
waiting for someone to get me out of here
out of here.. out of here
Oh, I just stay dead
I just stay dead
I just stay dead
I run to the ground
