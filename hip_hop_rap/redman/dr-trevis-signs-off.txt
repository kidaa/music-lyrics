Yo *echoes*
*weird hearbeat like sounds*
[I can hear myself... *echoes*]
*maniacal laughter*
*bell rings, slowly, then faster, then slows again*

On the behalf of the knotty-headed nigga
and the Def Squad force
We'd like to thank you for purchasin the new Redman tape
And hope you show the same love for us next go 'round

*bell rings*
*short, phat beat is looped*
*static*
