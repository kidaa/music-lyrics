Say there ain't no remedies for the way I feel
They say you ain't no good for me cuz you ain't for real
But they don't see the little things
The things that touch my heart
The way I feel when I'm inside your arms

And I love you
As in more than anything
And I love you
Even when my heart's in pain
And I love you
Is there any other way
I'm gon' love you 'till my dying day

See, I done been through everything, seen it all before
And I know there ain't no such thing as perfect love no more
But mines is good enough for me, so leave my heart alone
He's the best thing that my heart's gonna ever know

And I love you
As in more than anything
And I love you
Even when my heart's in pain
And I love you
Is there any other way
I'm gon' love you 'till my dying day

And I love you
As in more than anything
And I love you
Even when my heart's in pain
And I love you
Is there any other way
I'm gon' love you 'till my dying day

If love is a miracle, then I've got mine baby
Everybody is invisible, I don't need them in my life
Cuz you are my sunshine
Even though you bring the rain
I don't care what they do
I don't care what they say
I'm gonna love you anyway

And I love you
As in more than anything
And I love you
Even when my heart's in pain
And I love you
Is there any other way
I'm gon' love you 'till my dying day
