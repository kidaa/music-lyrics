Wanna bet

My oh my
How can this be there he goes
Talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive does he know
He's talking in his sleep

The affair okay
He's corrupt
What do I do, what do I say
I feel ashimed, embarrassed, fatigued
Such a petty crime of sexual indiscretion

At night when he lays down
How I wish I could not hear the sound
But I could
On the things that he said

My oh my
How can this be
There he goes talking in his sleep,
By and by
He will connive does he know
He's talkimg in his sleep
Adultery that's what the call it
When you're married
Tell me something
Why is it that the man are forgiven and the women aren't
I don't know may be, may be I should forgive him
May be I'm over-reacting what do you think...not!

The promisse he made
Said we'll be together for always
He's such a liar
Then he calls out her name

My oh my
How can this be
There he goes talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive does he know
He's talking in his sleep

Guilty secrets
They are haunting my life
And he doesn't even know that I know
Can you hear him

The promisses he makes
Said we'll be together for always
He's such a liar
Then he goes out to burn me

My oh my
How can this be
There he goes talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive does he know
He's talking in his sleep
