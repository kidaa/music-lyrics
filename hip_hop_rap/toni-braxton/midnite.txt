Baby.... baby....yeah

[Verse 1:]
It goes somethin like this,
Bout twenty minutes after six,
You see your man gettin ready,
Looking fresh to def,
He's about to head out,
So he gives you a kiss,
Says he's about to go and kick it,
Chill with his boys and you get jealous,
Cause he's always with the fellas,
Then you hear those magic words,
"Baby, I'ma Call You Later",
You say "Be Careful & Don't Get Hurt",
Now its five hours later.

[Chorus:]
Its midnite, tell me
Do you know where your man is
Its been a while
Since he left and he ain't checked in
Its midnite, tell me
Do you know where your man is
Cause something up, no doubt, no doubt
Girl you better find out, find out

[Verse 2:]
Now you're waiting at your crib,
And all you can think about
Is where could he be at this hour,
So you decide to take a trip,
And you hop up in the whip,
And now you're riding around
To all the places where you know he hangs out,
Then you say to yourself,
"Girl This Is Crazy, Why Are You Out Here Lookin So..Lady"
Then you think about those magic words,
"Baby, I'ma Call You Later",
You say "Be Careful & Don't Get Hurt",
Now its five hours later

[Chorus]
Its midnite, tell me
Do you know where your man is
Its been a while
Since he left and he ain't checked in
Its midnite, tell me
Do you know where your man is
Cause something up, no doubt, no doubt
Girl you better find out, find out

[hook]
Yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2 times]
Its midnite, tell me
Do you know where your man is
Its been a while
Since he left and he ain't checked in
Its midnite, tell me
Do you know where your man is
Cause something up, no doubt, no doubt
Girl you better find out, find out
