[Verse 1]
I see you coming through the door
Creepin'
It's a quarter past four
And
I smell the scent of cheap perfume
Who is she
You step in the room
With a guilty look upon your face
Busted
And you started to say 
But really baby I can explain
Save your breath 
I've got something to say

[Chorus:]
Every word you say is
Lies, lies, lies
And now I'm leaving you, so
Bye, bye, bye
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin'
You know that you ain't @#%$ 
With your 
Lies, lies, lies
Ohhhhh

[Verse 2]
Don't bother to apologize
It's too late
I've heard it all before
And 
This should come as no surprise 
I'm leaving
I've packed my things
Cause I'm through with this merry go around
I'm getting off
I've finally found
My strength waiting down
I should have left your @#%$
After the first round
Ohhhh

[Chorus:]
Every word you say is
Lies, lies, lies
And now I'm leaving you, so
Bye, bye, bye
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin'
You know that you ain't @#%$ 
With your 
Lies, lies, lies

Please, please
Oh please
[laughs]
Yeah
What you goin' do
Tell your boys
All how you got over again
Yeah right 
Get off your knees
Oh, baby, please
Go ahead and tell the truth
Yeah
You know what
You see this fire in my eyes
It's all because of you
All you do is lie

[Chorus:]
Every word you say is
Lies, lies, lies Goodbye, yeah. Whooo
And now I'm leaving you, so
Bye, bye, bye Leaving you, leaving you, ohhh
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin' Too many tears over the years
You know that you ain't @#%$ 
With your 
Lies, lies, lies Every little word you say is driving me crazy, insane

Every word you say is Why lie
Lies, lies, lies
And now I'm leaving you, so Bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye 
And I can't take no more of this
Cry, cry, cryin'
You know that you ain't @#%$ 
With your 
Lies, lies, lies You aint @#%$ with your li, li, li, li, lies
