I feel before we go any further
I think that I should let you know
I've got a boyfriend
And I would hate to do
Anything to hurt him
So my loyalty I'll show
Don't wanna cheat on him
Never been the kind of girl
Who'd be unfair in relationships
I don't wanna lead you on
No I

Don't want a love affair
I ain't never been the kind to cheat
Cause that ain't me
Don't want a love affair
See I ain't down with o.p.p.
No I
Don't want a love affair
It doesn't matter if we're being discreet
Cause that's not me
Don't wanna play around I ain't down with o.p.p.

Now you're startin' to
Look real good to me
But I think it's best you go
Before we go too far
Gotta try to resist temptation
That way nobody gets hurt
I got a boyfriend
Even if I was your girl
I still wouldn't give myself to another
Why can't you just understand
That's just the way I am

Don't want a love affair It doesn't matter if we're 
being discreet
Cause that ain't me
Don't want a love affair
As long as my man's lovin' me
Don't want a love affair
It doesn't matter if we're being discreet
That's not me
Don't wanna play around
I will never kiss and tell

Can't believe that you would say you still
Would have respect in the morning
When i just couldn't respect myself
