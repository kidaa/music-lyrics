[1st verse]

I know you watch        
All over here,
Tryna finda way to 
Come into my situation,
But you should know this.
Its all good so be cool.
Tell your girl i dont care to fight
I got him locked, and he's all mine
So you should know better than
To think that you could ever put it down like i can.

[chorus]

If he needs good lovin i got it
If i need to heat it up i got fire,
Make sure i'm the best for him for sure
He's running home to me for it.
And he knows waht ever he wants that im with it
And he knows the perfect place to come get it
And he knows that every woman's in me.
Fall  back and just let me be.
I gots to breath uh oh, uh oh, uh oh please,  
Back up off of me
I gots to breathe and just be
Breathe, please, in case yall didnt hear me yeah yeah
I gots to breathe so let me breathe, please

[2nd verse]

You're in violation, let me help you understand, 
Before we have a problem.
I could take it there
When it comes to my man
Please don't let me solve em.
Everyday is a holiday, 
Everyday's our anniversary.
You should think about the time you waste 
Cuz my last name aint gon change

[chorus]

If he needs good lovin i got it
If i need to heat it up i got fire,
Make sure i'm the best for him for sure
He's running home to me for it.
And he knows waht ever he wants that im with it
And he knows the perfect place to come get it
And he knows that every woman's in me.
Fall  back and just let me be.

Back up off of me

Breathe, please, in case yall didnt hear me yeah yeah
