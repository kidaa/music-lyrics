Ain't nobody ever prove their love when
Things were all good
And two people are smiling
Love is found way down in the trenches
When he's throwin a fit
And she is sittin there crying
We tear it up
To patch it up
Break up
To make up
The show goes round and round
And that how we get down
We go back and forth
And anyone who goes through this should know
That what i am saying is for real
Real love is meant this way

We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin
She's trippin
And we both be trippin and
That's the way love works out sometimes
Cause when it's on it's on
And your no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessin
Cause when it's all said and done
Were back at square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes

What you know about screamin' yellin' cuzin' pushin', and rumblin' and arguing
Like it's 12 rounds up inside the garden
I say where the hell you going
And you say I'm getting up out of here
And I say you ain't going no where
Then I follow you down the stairs,
Get in front of you and then I scream
Times like this I know you're
Still the one
And the truth is this is really love
And ooooh yeah
When I feel like going off
I brush my shoulders off
And you know...

We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin
She's trippin
And we both be trippin and
That's the way love works out sometimes
Cause when it's on it's on
And your no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessin
Cause when it's all said and done
Were back at square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes

You wont believe it until you see it
How much you need somebody
need somebody
And you'll never know how far you'll go
When you love somebody
love somebody
Ooohooh

Sometime we say the craziest things!

We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin
She's trippin
And we both be trippin and
That's the way love works out sometimes
Cause when it's on it's on
And your no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessin
Cause when it's all said and done
Were back at square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes
