Lonely in bed
At night
And it never feels right
I toss and turn
Each night
Till the morning light
But just the thought of you
Sends chills up and down my spine
Just knowing you'll be here real soon
Makes everything alright

Candlelight
It makes it special
Me and you
On a rare occasion
Candlelight a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation
Candlelight

Memories of you
Your arm baby,
Squeezing me close to your heart
Shadows in the dark
Baby
Of you kissing ever part
And knowing we can share it all
And still be
Still be free
For each and every magic moment
Will last for eternity

Candlelight
It makes it special
Me and you
On a rare occasion
Candlelight a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation
Candlelight 

And my love for you
Will never fade away
I'll save a special spot
For you baby always
Don't you know my heart
Has made for you
A special place
Don't you know
Call on me
When you want me
When you want me
I'm here for you

Candlelight
It makes it special
Me and you
On a rare occasion
Candlelight a special night
Seeing you is a sweet sensation
Candlelight
