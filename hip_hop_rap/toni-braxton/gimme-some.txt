4 letter words and 3 wishes
Is what I came or
Love birds blowin' kisses in picture frame form
With just a faction of this major attraction, comming soon
I bust and implode, gimme gimme room
I keep blazin', it's so amazin'
The occasion that I am raisin', massive body invasion
So what you savin' all that love for
open up your mind, explore, and make it hard core
I'll be your candy store
Give you just a little more than what you bargained for
And if you ask me for some guidance, it's not a minus
I'll break it down to a science, kitchen appliance
69 gimme mine, I'll be your valentine
365 days I want my sun to shine
See, I've been waiting for the planets to realign
Total eclipse on my lips until the end of time
