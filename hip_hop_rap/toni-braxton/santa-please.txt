Santa, please, will you help me 
      'cause I'm all alone with my Christmas tree... 
      See, my honey's on his way, his flight's delayed 
      Can you bring him on your sleigh? 
      'Cause time is going 

      Slowly dragging me along... 
      Santa, please bring my man home... 

      Santa, please, will you help me 
      'cause I'm all alone and so unhappy... 
      See, I need my baby here to hold me tight 
      Can you bring him here tonight? 
      'cause time is going 

      Chorus

      Santa, please, please help me 

      'cause I'm all alone and I need, I need... 
      Up to now I've been real good, so tell me why 
      Why is time taking its time and going so 

      Chorus

      Call Dasher, call Dancer, call Prancer, 
      call Vixen... 
      Can you help me out real quick, 
      it's an emergency 
      On comet, on Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen... 
      Can you help me out St. Nick, 
      'cause time is going 

      Chorus
