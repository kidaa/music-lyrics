I've got it
Ohh, I've got it
I've got it

[Verse 1:]
There 
Ain't no need
To call your friends
And tell them you'll be out
Hangin' at the club tonight
Baby can't you see
That I've been working out
My body's tight
I can make you feel
Happy and so nice
Just tell me what you desire
Want me to swing from a pole
I've got you
If you want me baby to make you warm
I've got you
If you wanna see my thongs up high
I can do it right
If you want a little private dance
I've got you
If you want it baby with romance
I've got you
If you want a little mnage e trois
Baby, that's too far

[Chorus:]
Tell me
What 
You 
Want
Tell me
What 
You 
Need
Satisfaction is
Guaranteed
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
There ain't no need
To stay out late
There ain't no need to lie
Cause I'm waiting home for you baby
Just tell me what you need
I've got company
And toys and things
To set the mood tonight
Your wish is my command, sugar
Just tell me what's your fantasy
Want me to swing from a pole
I've got you
If you want me baby to make you warm
I've got you
If you wanna see my thongs up high
I can do it right
Ooh, If you want a little private dance
If you want it baby with romance
I've got you
If you want a little mnage e trois
Baby, that's too far

[Chorus:]
Tell me
What 
You 
Want
Tell me
What 
You 
Need
Satisfaction is
Guaranteed
[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
I've got it
Ohh, I've got it
I've got it

All that you want
Babe, I've got it
Yes indeed
Just come home to me
Baby can't you see
All that you want
Babe, I've got it
Please believe
Just put your trust in me
Baby can't you see

[Chorus:]
Tell me
What 
You 
Want
Tell me
What 
You 
Need
Satisfaction is
Guaranteed

[Repeat until end]
