Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
      Let your heart be light 
      Next year all our troubles will be out of sight... 

      Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
      Make the yuletide gay 
      Next year all out troubles will be miles away... 

      Once again as in olden days 
      Happy golden days of yore 
      Faithful friends who are dear to us 
      Will be near to us once more 
      Someday we all will be together 
      If the fates allow 
      Until then we'll have to make it through the somehow 
      So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
