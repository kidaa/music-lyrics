Like a mountain that's worth the climb I'm talking about this man of mine
It's like money I wanna to spend
My homie lover friend
He'll be with me to the end
And he never fell me yet 

So I give him 
Good loving in the morning I got that
And late in the evening Umm I got that
And I hold him tight
And I let him know
Daddy everything is alright
Now what's good I got all the love that he needs
What's good Coming with it just the way he need it now
What's good Off top you know it won't stop
He can get all of my love 
Now the thing that I love the most What's that
Is that he gets what I love the most Well alright
Understanding all of my moods
Knowing just what to say and do
And yes I am the best
And the rest he'll never miss
And yes he's dressed in finest
What's next is to love, honor, protect
What's next is just a cause and effect of being so blessed
