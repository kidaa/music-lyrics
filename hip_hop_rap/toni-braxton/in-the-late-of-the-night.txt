Lyrics and Music by Babyfaceand Jonathan Buck 


      Always thought your promise was for life 
      I did not think that I 
      Would hear you say good-bye 
      And I always heard you led another life 
      I doubted every time 
      I guess every time 
      Cause in my eyes 
      Love was always something magical 
      But the feeling is so tragic for 
      And all I know is in love 
      The thing that I want most 
      I can't possess 
      There's only emptiness 

      In the late of night 
      Just before I closed my eyes 
      You lied 
      As you kissed me goodnight 
      In the late of night 
      Just before I closed my eyes 
      I cried 
      As you kissed my lips good-bye 

      In my eyes 
      You will always be the lucky one 
      Cause you know you'll always have my love 
      For all time until I die 
      Through the end I gave to you my best 
      You gave, you gave me loneliness 

      In the late of night 
      Just before I closed my eyes 
      You lied 
      As you kissed me goodnight 
      In the late of night 
      Just before I closed my eyes 
      I cried 
      As you kissed my lips good-bye
