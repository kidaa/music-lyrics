Did you think my life would end that day
That you walked out when you broke my heart
Did you think I couldn't make it through
Ooh, without you
Did you think you'd stop my world with goodbye, oh no
Did you think I'd crumble inside
Not Me, I'm still breathing
And this heart of mine is still beating
I, I'm not feeling any pain
No baby, not me, I'm still breathing
This old heart of mine is still beating
The tears I cried have dried
you are gone and I survived
I'm still breathing

There were times when it took all my strength
To just get through, yeah, through another day
There were so many nights I thought that I was gonna die
Without you
But the tears I cried somehow made me strong, so strong
Did you think I couldn't go on 

Not Me, I'm still breathing
And this heart of mine is still beating
I, I'm not feeling any pain
No baby, not me, I'm still breathing
This old heart of mine is still beating
The tears I cried have dried
you are gone and I survived
I'm still breathing

You tried to cut me down
But look who's still around
Without you
Did you think you'd stop my world with good bye, no baby
Did you think I'd crumble, just crumble inside

Not Me, I'm still breathing
And this heart of mine is still beating
I, I'm not feeling any pain
No baby, not me, I'm still breathing
This old heart of mine is still beating
The tears I cried have dried
you are gone and I survived

I'm still breathing

The tears I cried have dried
You are gone and I survived
I'm still breathing
The tears I cried have dried
You are gone and I survived
I'm still breathing
