This time next year I'll be home lighting candles 
      Tryin' to just get on with my life... 
      And this time next year hope I'm through 
      with the hurtin' 
      Tryin' to get you out of my mind... 

      So, don't try to play like you're not that concerned 
      And don't try to say that your heart doesn't burn 
      So, tell me 

      How can you say that our love isn't special? 
      How can you say 
      That our love wasn't true? 
      And how can you say 
      You can take it or leave it 
      When I'm missing you and you know 
      You'll be missing me, too? 

      This time next year I'll be out buying presents 
      And something will remind me of you... 
      And this time next year I'll be out having dinner 
      And run into some friends we both knew... 

      Oh, don't try to play like you won't be concerned 
      And don't try to say that your heart doesn't yearn 
      Oh, tell me 

      Chorus

      Come early Christmas morning 
      I'll be having my coffee and I'll think of you 
      And the things we used to do 
      And you know it will be breaking my heart... 
      'Cause the holidays are special 
      it will always play a part 
      In my heart... 

      Chorus
