I'm sitting and waiting for you 
      'cause you said you're on your way 
      I'm so excited 'cause this is my favorite holiday 

      Gifts are under the tree, dinner for you 
      and me, how special it will be 
      'Cause you and I are here... 
      Make all your favorite treats, 
      so glad that it will be 
      You and me on this Christmas holiday... 

      Holiday, celebrate, making out with my babe 
      Holiday, in the snow, kissing under mistletoe... 

      I'm thinking about all the things we can do 
      when I see you tonight 
      I'm so excited 'cause everybody's here, 
      so let's dance all night... 

      We'll be counting down to two, Crystal for me 
      and you, that's what we came to do 
      We came to have some fun 
      Joy and laughter's in the air, 
      so glad that we can share 
      You and me on this Christmas day... 

      Chorus

      All of the things I'm gonna do 
      celebrating with you, baby 
      All of the things I'm gonna do 
      when we're alone, oh, baby... 
      We're gonna 
      Go insane, dance in snowy rain, 
      even drink champagne 
      Baby, I can't wait to be alone and celebrate 

      Chorus
