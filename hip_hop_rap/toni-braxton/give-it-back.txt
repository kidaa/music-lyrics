Give it back, give it back, give it back
Give my uh uh back

Give my uh uh back

Give it back, give it back, give it back
Give my uh uh back

[Verse I:]

I thought I met a good man whose name I won't discuss
He sold me a dream that we were really in love
But I heard it on the street that you were steppin' out on me
Now I'm walking out that door and taking everything with me
Give it to me back

[Verse 2:]

You say you want your car back and the keys to your house
But there's one thing I want before I get the hell out
No recalls, no coupon, I wants my refund
I'm sorry I met you 'cuz boy you're not the one

[Hook]

[Bridge:]

I heard it, heard it on the street
You were steppin' out on me
No coupons, no recalls
I want my refund, yeah
