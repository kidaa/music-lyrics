      really me, you know
      I mean basically, I just think I'm gonna 
      need some space 

      Why are you calling me on the phone

      Friends
      'Cuz you got a lot on your mind
      Now you're swearing up and down that
      It ain't me
      Still you say that things have changed
      So tell me what exactly does it mean
      When you say you need your space

      Just don't make no excuses, no no
      Why you gotta lie to me

      I Mean, you gotta understand I love
      You, you know what I'm saying
      And I love you enough to say that I
      Think,
      I Think you deserve somebody better
      Than me, you know
      And right now, I can't give you what
      You need, you know

      I mean, I wanna love you, and I'm gonna
      Love you, one day but, you know
      I mean, you just gotta understand
      Where I'm coming from

      You say right now that you're not
      What I'm looking for
      And what you really need is time to
      Grow
      You're promising that one day you may
      Come around
      And I'm supposed to let that go
      But where the hell do you get off
      Telling me your mama said
      I'm not what you need
      Tell you what, since she knows it all
      Then that's where you need to be
