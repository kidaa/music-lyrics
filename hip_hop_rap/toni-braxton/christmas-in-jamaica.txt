      We'll be having fun 
      Under the golden sun 
      Christmas in Jamaica here we come... 
      We'll just sail on, just sail... 

      Lovers frolickin' 
      Playin' in the sand 
      Got my Coppertone 
      Getting on my tan 

      Exotic setting for a 
      Lady and her man 
      A perfect little holiday 
      Sounds like a plan 

      We can stay in bed all afternoon 
      we can make out to some cool Reggae tunes 
      We can sail under the light of the moon 
      Wish we could freeze this moment 
      then it wouldn't end so soon... 

      Chorus

      Unplug the phones, y'all 
      Don't need no calls 
      No callin' home 
      Take a break from it all... 

      'Cause we both grown 
      And we can do whatever, see? 
      Baby, it's just you and me 
      Let's live out a fantasy 

      Hiking in the mountains, romantic rendezvous 
      Bathing in the fountains, stop-let me look at you... 
      Just in case you're doubtin', let me paint a view 
      Picture you're in heaven, everything is true 

      Chorus
