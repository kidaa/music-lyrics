Loving you is stupid
Cause I know that you never really loved me
And you never gave me signs Id see
That you and me were ever a possibility
And I feel so stupid
After all the noise you left me lonely to die
And you never gave me a reason why
And now Im sittin all alone and I cry

Am I stupid
I shouldve known you were only playing a game
And you and me would never be the same
You made me feel like Im the one to blame
And I feel so stupid
After all those nights after nights that I tried
And all those conversations of lies
And Im sittin here all alone and Im cryin

Im crying....

I cant believe you never knew how I felt 
All this love and baby no one else 
Could ever love me the way that you do
Youre all I need and you treated me so wrong
And I cant believe it 
How could you do me like you do
Cause Ive been so stupid for you

Why do you do me like you do
You baby, You darlin
You baby, You darlin
You dont care 
Im stupid baby, Im stupid darlin 
For you

And Im the one played
And Im the one left with all the shame
Im stupid baby, Stupid darlin
