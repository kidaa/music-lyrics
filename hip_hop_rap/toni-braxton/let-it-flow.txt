First thing Monday morning
I'm gonna pick my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better day
You see the thing 'bout love
Is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pair
There comes a time when we could all make a change

Just let go
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right,
Ya know
Let go, and let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let go

Don't nobody want no broken heart
And don't nobody want on two losers
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
You see the thing of it
Is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time when we must go our own way

Just let go
And let it glow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right,
Y'know
Let go,a nd let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let go

Sometimes love it can work out right
Sometimes you'll never know
But if it brings only pain in your life
Don't be afraid to let it go
