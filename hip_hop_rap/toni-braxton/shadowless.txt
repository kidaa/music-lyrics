[Verse 1:]
Ooh boy where are you now  
You came and you rescued me when I was down.
Now I'm shadowless, life is such a mess, where did we go wrong 
Impossible to see, I'm supposed to be, 'cause my light is gone

[Chorus:]
Gotta make it right with you, you baby
So tell me what I gotta do, to make you come back home

[Verse 2:]
Ooh boy how can this be
I remember every second you were here with me
Now I'm shadowless, think I was once blessed just to have you by side yeah yeah
But then you went away and suddenly the rain washed away my sunny skies ooh yeah 

[Chorus 2:]
Gotta make it right with you, you baby
So tell me what I gotta do yea yea yeah, to make you come back home
Gotta make it right with you, you baby yea yea yeah
So tell me what I gotta do to make you come back home

[Verse 3:]
Cause I'm running down a street, trying to find the answers
When I'm feeling incomplete, see the truth is what I'm after
Why'd you go yeah why'd you leave took the reflection from me

[Chorus 3:]
Gotta make it right yeah so right baby yeah yeah yeah
So tell me what I gotta do baby yeah, to make you come back home
Gotta make it right with you , yea yea yeah,  you baby
So tell me what I gotta do to make you come back home
