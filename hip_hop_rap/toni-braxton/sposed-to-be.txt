I never hafta check his story
Or worry bout him when he's gone
'Cause even when he's not at home
He's right where he said he'd be
Never go to be frustrated
And I never ever ever hafta fake it
'Cause when it comes to our love-makin'
He always seems to please

[Hook]
Say mmm mmm mmm
What he's serving tastes so good to me
Say mmm mmm mmm
He ain't perfect but he does it for me

[Chorus]
My man is tailor-made for me
He comes in just my size
And every time I put him on,
I swear he fits just right
Ooooh yeah
Baby, that's how it's sposed to be
I ride for him and he's down for me
There ain't no other lady gon' be sexin' my baby but me
And, baby, that's how it's sposed to be

Knows where every single spot is
Every one he hears that drop
When he wanna get it off
No problem,
he knows it's all of me
He ain't up with the games and front, no
The staking on his name means somethin
We ain't lettin' go for nothin'
We gon' make history

[Hook]
Say mmm mmm mmm
What he's serving tastes so good to me
Say mmm mmm mmm
He ain't perfect but he does it for me

[Chorus]
My man is tailor-made for me
He comes in just my size
And every time I put him on,
I swear he fits just right
Ooooh yeah
Baby, that's how it's sposed to be
I ride for him and he's down for me
There ain't no other lady gon' be sexin' my baby but me
And, baby, that's how it's sposed to be

[Bridge]
And I know sometimes we fight
You go your way, I go mine
Still it's you I adore I adore
And I put this on my life
As long as I'm alive
Boy, it's you I live for

Oh, baby
That's how it's sposed to be
He's my baby
Can't nobody take my man from me

[Chorus]
Baby, that's how it's sposed to be
I ride for him and he's down for me
There ain't no other lady gon' be sexin' my baby but me
And, baby, that's how it's sposed to be

We can "Oh no forget it"
I'm his, that's automatic
His love, I gotta have it
And that's how its s'posed to be
