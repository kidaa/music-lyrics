[Verse 1]
Hello
Hello it's me again
You're still not home
Cause if you were
It's after 4 a.m.
I wouldn't be here alone
See, God give me the strength 
And the 
Courage I need
When my heart aches for you
I have to let it be

[Chorus:]
But it's OK
I Understand
You've got to leave
I won't cry no more
Baby what for
You don't shed a tear for me
See I was blind, but now I see
There's got to be, a better man for me, yeah
There's got to be, a better man for me

[Verse 2]
Hell no
Oh no not this again
I'll be counting down
Your bags are packed
And they're at the door
I've got to get used to not having you around
God gave me the strength 
And the 
Courage I need
To move forward with my life
I have to let it be

[Chorus:]
But it's OK
I Understand
You've got to leave
I won't cry no more
Baby what for
You don't shed a tear for me
See I was blind, but now I see
There's got to be
Got to be
A better man 
A better man
For me
There's got to be, a better man for me

Got to be a better man
Oooh, darlin'
Hear me now
God give me the strength 
And the 
Courage I need
Cause I know now, baby
There's got to be a better man for me

You've got to leave
Oooh yeah
You don't shed a tear for me
See I was blind, but now I see
There's got to be
Got to be a better plan
A better man for me, baby
One more time, yeah, ya'll
There's got to be, a better man for me

See I'm tired of your lying 
And I'm tired of trying
You've got to leave
I don't cry no more
Baby what for
You don't shed a tear for me
See I was blind, but now I see
There's got to be, a better plan for me. 
Somewhere out there, baby
There's got to be, a better man for me

Oooh
Yeah
Got to be a better man
