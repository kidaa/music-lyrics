[Intro]
Think about it
Remember when
When we first fell in love
I just want that feeling back again
You know, what it used to be
You and me, listen

I believe we can be whatever we want to be
And I know we'll be alright
I can see what you need, and what you need is me
Like you did on our first night

You make everything lovely
You make everything lovely
You make everything lovely
Yes indeed, that's why I'm hurting

Can we fall in love again
Like we did back then
Do you remember when
Do you remember when
Do it like you did it back then
And then we'll do it again
Do you remember when

Reminiscing and more on what we had before
Makes me feel so warm inside
Wanting you constantly and feeling so sorry
That we had to say goodbye

You're my everything, baby
You're my everything, baby
You're my everything, baby
Can't you see, that's why I'm hurting

Can we fall in love again
Like we did back then
Do you remember when
Do you remember when
Do it like you did it back then
And then we'll do it again
Do you remember when

Don't you remember, baby
Maybe we aren't all that we used to be
Maybe we could start from the beginning
You're giving me a love that just cannot leave
So tell me that you still love me

Can we fall in love again
Like we did back then
Do you remember when
Do you remember when
Do it like you did it back then
And then we'll do it again
Do you remember when

Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember when
[Repeat x2]
[while:]
When we used to touch
When we used to laugh
When we used to do the things we used to do
Do you remember, come on
Do you remember , come on
