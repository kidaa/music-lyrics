That Somebody Was You 

      There were so many times my heart has been broken in two 
      I kept them waiting enough 
      Cause nobody's heart was true 
      For every time I gave into love 
      I was always in the blue 
      And just when I was about to give up I found myself and angel call to you 

      I've been waiting for a lifetime for somebody to love me like you do, oh yeah 
      I was thinking that I'd always be lonely 
      But God came up with someone like you 
      Just to think I had made up my mind love was over 
      Somebody gave me the love 
      That somebody was you 

      I tell you night after night 
      ??? 
      But no one never ??? they could not compare to you 
      I wasn't sure if I could 
      It's been the same at the end 
      I even know what I've got is through 
      ??? 

      I've been waiting for a lifetime for somebody to love me like you do 
      I was thinking that I would be lonely 
      But God came up with someone like you 
      Just to think I had made up my mind love was over 
      Somebody gave me the love 
      That somebody was you
