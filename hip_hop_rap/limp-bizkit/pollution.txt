Come on fool
Aw...aw...aw drop that shit
Straight comin' at ya, punk
The greatest side is critical when digging on my concept
Rhythms keep on building like smoke
Got'cha running from the law
Maybe it's that low end smothered with the freestyle
Maybe it's the thought of being on the bottom of the pile
Style's bound to the sky lines
Keep 'em on the sidelines
Choking on my fly rhymes
You need the Heimlich maneuver
This ain't no joke
You're gonna choke
When I'm swinging it to ya

[chorus]
When do you decide you decide
Then you can know in your mind you decide
When do you decide
I'll probably never understand
Pollution, you preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
Pollution, I keep the grip tight on the mic when I spill
Pollution, you preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
Pollution, I keep that grip real tight
Breaker, breaker one nine, spitting out that skill
Suicidal punk let me know you're real
I'm walking on a thin line with the sticky bass line
Now you're stuck with the flow running through your mind
So if you're crossing over, let me know you're real
 now you get the feel
I rumble like the thunder
Now you're going under
I bet ya wonder what the fuck is even going down
I listen to 'em stereotype and then complain
I can't refrain from bringing on the pain
When do you decide you decide
Then you can know in your mind you decide
When do you decide
I'll probably never understand
Pollution, you preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
Pollution, I keep the grip tight on the mic when I spill
Pollution, you preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
Pollution, I keep that grip real tight
So when they tell me to turn down that volume
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell Sam to turn down that bass
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell me to turn down the vocal
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell us to shut the fuck up
I'm gonna bring that beat back
Yeah, gonna bring that beat back
Aw, gonna bring that beat back
Fuck, gonna bring that beat back
Yo, yo, yo J bring that beat back
When do you decide you decide
Then you can know in your mind you decide
When do you decide
I'll probably never understand
Pollution, you preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
Pollution, I keep the grip tight on the mic when I spill
Pollution, you preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
Pollution, I keep that grip real tight
I'm gonna bring that beat back
I'm gonna bring that beat back
I'm gonna bring that beat back, beat back
Bring that beat back, beat back - [2x]
Back [repeated a bunch of times]
Fred shut up, alright
This is me telling you to shut up..shut up
Fred, shut the fuck up
We're done
