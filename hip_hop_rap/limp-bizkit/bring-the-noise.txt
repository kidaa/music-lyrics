Gimme some guitars punk 
Sweet Leth 
Limp Bizkit in the house 
What fucken' house? 
Seattle baby 
Terry Date, Limp Bizkit, Staind 

Bring the noise 
Bass! how low can you go? 
Death row what a brother knows 
Once again, back is the incredible 
The rhyme animal 
The incredible D. Public Enemy number one 
Five-o said  freeze!  and I got numb 
Can I tell 'em that I never really had a gun? 
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun 
Now they got me in a cell 'cuz my records they sell 
'Cuz a brother like me said  well?  
Farrakhan's a racist and I think you outta listin to 
What he can say to you what you otta do 
Follow for now power of the people say. 
 Make a miracle, D. pump the lyrical  
United we stand, all in all, we're gonna win. 
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again 

Turn it up, bring the noise! 
I said turn it up! 

Never badder than bad 'cuz the brother is madder than mad 
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator 
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope 
'Cuz the beats in the lines are so dope 
Listen for lessons I'm saying 
Inside music that the critics are blasting me 
For they'll never care for the brother and sisters 
Now across the country has us up for the war. 
We got to demostrate, come on 
They're gonna have to wait 'till we get it right 
Radio stations I question their blackness 
They call themselves black. but we'll see if they'll play this 

Turn it up, bring the noise! 
I said turn it up! 

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me 
My DJ is Lethal dose, we call him Leth you know 
He can cut a record from side to side 
So what, the ride the glide should be much safer than a suicide 
Soul control, beat is the father or our rock' n' roll 
Music for whatcha, for whichin' you call a band man 
Makin' a music abuse it but you can't do it, ya know 
You call 'em demos but we ride limos, too 
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you 
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono 
Run DMC first said a DJ could be a band 
Stand on it's feet get you out your seat 
Beat is for Eric B. and LB as well, hell 
Records from Fred D still we can rock bells 
Ever for ever, Universal it will sell 
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it 

Turn it up, bring the noise! 
I said turn it up! 

Bring that fucken' noise, and get the fuck up 
Get the fuck up 
Bring the noise 
Bring it 
Fuck this 
Limp Bizkit 
Fuck this 
In the studio 
Fucken Suck ass 
Bring that noise 
Man fuck this 
Terry Date is a fucken pain 
Everybody shut up and turn the fucken' tape off
