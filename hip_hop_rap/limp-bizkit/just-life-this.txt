get up
get up
like this
just like this
do you feel it
get up
just like this
do you wanna catch the vibe 
that's keeping me alive?
I'm following these phat ass beats until i die
fill'em with tension
the same demension
I rumble the earth with my lowered suspension
just watch the ground move
let the sound prove
that it ain't fake when the girls get naked
don't call it a comeback
we bring that beat back
and we made sure that John kept them beats phat
a lyrical rampage
burning your headset
open your mind 
my rhymes ain't dead yet
I want you to stand up
put them hands up
I'll break it on down
cause you pumpin my band up
like this
just like this
come on
get up 
{chorus}
music is key
its the way we're set free
from all this world is throwin at me
the rythems so insane
flowin' your vein
triggerin that neck poppin nerve up in the brain
I don't even know ya
I came to show ya
the bizkit's limp when the night is over
we shake the whole place
makin this earthquake
and it ain't fake when we start the riots
so rock the bells
psycho females
doin time
blownin up the phone line
call it a stampede 
comin to yo town
we ain't gonna hold back
we're comin to get down
i want you to stand up
and put them hands up
and bring it on down cause your keepin my band down
like this
just like this
{chorus}
music is key
its the way we're set free
from all this world is throwin at me
and I'll do what it takes
if i make some mistakes
its ok
cause its all
just the way it should be
just like this
yo bring that back
{Chorus}
music is key
its the way we're set free
from all this world is throwin at me
and I'll do what it takes
if i make some mistakes
its ok
cause its all
just the way it should be
