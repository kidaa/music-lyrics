you keep your distance i can't deny you i've got the feeling 
can't satisfy you i've got your picture on the wall i got the picture, 
long gone you keep your wishes i'll keep my feelings there goes 
another one that kept me breathing i'm waiting for you
i know your leaving i still adore you you never leave me hold on, 
i found another way to let you go away hold on, 
you found another way to bleed my soul away the things you told me 
to hear you speak i'm burning slowly i'm growing weak you 
bring me closer to yesterday yesterday's a million miles away 
why can't you hear me why can't i sleep 
and i don't understand what keeps me breathing 
i'm waiting for you i know your leaving 
i'll still adore you you'll never need me hold on,
i found another way to let you go away
hold on, you found another way to bleed my soul 
away [repeats 4 times]
