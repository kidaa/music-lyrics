why is everybody always pickin' on me 
does anybody really know a thing about me 
but one of these days we'll be in the same place in the same place punk, 
at the very same time yeah, 
but when it takes place and you wanna talk shit then step your ass up 
and say right to my face you'll get knocked the fuck out 
'cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass 
can't cash knocked straight the fuck out 
'cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass 
can't cash i ain't believing all the shit you've been talkin' about me 
don't even know me and still your talkin' shit about me 
but one of these days i'm gonna catch you in the act in the act, 
red-handed caught up in the act, 
punk and that'll be the day the one and only day to step your ass up 
and say right to my face you'll get knocked the fuck out 
'cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass 
can't cash knocked straight the fuck out
