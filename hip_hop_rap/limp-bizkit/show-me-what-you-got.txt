I left my heart in Austin with Mary Campbell. 
Got lost in Boston lookin' for the tea party. 
Met a child molester in Worchester 
Need a Kleenex every time I'm leavin' Phoenix. 
I get silly when I play in Philly. 
Limp Bizkit committee down in Kansas City. 
Never know what I'm in for when I'm play in Denver. 
Hard rock don't stop down in Vegas. 
In Cincinnati the girls call me daddy 
and I probably aint leavin' the next time I'm in Cleveland. 
Found my lucky coin in Des Moine
and spit on a boy named Tina in Pasadena. 
We get the swing from new Orleans. 
Ft Worth and Dallas we toast when we're tippin' up the challis. 
Tulsa, St. Louis, Sacto, Mesa, Norfolk, Lawrence, Minneapolis, 
St. Paul, North Hampton, Detroit, Omaha, New York, LA,

i can't help but believe in these friends

these stories
and the places that i've been
I thank God, mom & dad, 
Adrian,for the love I feel inside, 
Jordan, my phat ass band, 
with out'em I'd be nothin' but a pumpkin shoved inside a can. 
with out the fans there wouldn't be no show 
and if that was really so than life would really blow. 
To the firm, you always got my back. 
Korn for the love and the swappin' of the tracks. 
My brother Cory d, 
my man terry date, we brought it to the plate and you made it sound great. 
Scott Weiland the melody man,
if you cant sing it nobody can. 
woo tang clan skills from the method. 
The worlds best mc kills on this record. 
Slim shady crazy ass cracker. 
Staind, a brand new drug for your brain. 
Les Claypool, for actin' like a fool 
and all of the bands for the demos that were kool.

The ones I didn't thank 
I will some other time

i've been around this world and then some. 
dum ditty dum kid where you comin' from 
I went from the garage 
to steppin' on these stages. 
Outrageous rhymes left my mind and soon became contagious. 
An mc with bad habits I am. 
I see a mic then I grab it, 
scary aint it 
comin' raw with no corrections. 
savin' all perfection's 
for what I do with my erections so dream on!!
