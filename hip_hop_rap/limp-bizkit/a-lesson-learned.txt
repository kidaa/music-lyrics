This pain 
in my stomach 
wont go away. 
I assume 
this is punishment 
from all 
the mistakes ive made. 
In a world where my actions
speak louder than words. 
In a world where my actions 
speak louder than words 
I know more people than ever before. 
One lesson ive learned from it all. 
Fortune and fame are dissted as your friend 
cuz im lonlier now than ive ever been.
