Happy New Year! 
Let me see them hands! 
Do you feel it 
If you feel it, get up, c'mon get up! 
I was feelin' when I wrote this, could be good if we go insane. 
When I woke up this morning could've sworn it was Judgement Day.
The sky was all purple, and people runnin' everywhere. 
Try to run from the destruction 
You know I didn't even care. 
You know it, c'mon! 
Are you ready 
Dance, dance!

2000, zero zero! 
Party up, all the time! 
'Cause tonight we gonna party like it's 1999! 
Come on, one more time, let's do it! 
2000, zero zero, party up, all the time! 
'Cause tonight we gonna party like it's 1999!

Do you feel me, New York City 
It goes like this. 
Let's try it again, c'mon! 
This is 1999, get up!

I was feelin' when I wrote this, could sue me if I go too fast. 
But life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last. 
This money's grown around me, my mind's never been a party! 
But if we gotta die, gonna party with a price to pay! 
Are you ready, sing with me. 
Let's do it! 
Dance!

2000, zero zero, party up, through all the time! 
'Cause tonight we gonna party like it's 1999! 
Everybody, c'mon! 2000, zero zero party up, all the time! 
'Cause tonight we gonna party like it's 1999!

Let me hear some noise, New York City!
