Fame you're claimin' is the top of the world. 
This stage I'm claimin' is the top of the world. 
Love I'm feelin when you people connect 
and if you're out in the crowd you're gettin' more than respect. 
If you're wondering 
I got plenty of flows. 
I'm makin' plenty of friends 
and many are foes,
but as the audience grows 
security knows 
stoppin' me now is kinda serious. 
No use in dreadin' 
what they call Armageddon. 
I think we made it through the slump. 
But who really cares where we're headin' 
cuz now you mutherfuckers got a reason to jump!! 

[chorus]
so lets make somethin' out of it. 
This way we can all relate. 
Worldwide we collide. 
This is how we communicate. 
So lets make somethin' out of it. 
Whoever thought we would see the day. 
I cant believe we did it. 
So lets drift away. 
Hate, 
a feelin' I don't really get. 
And hate can get you in some serious shit. 
Time is somethin' 
that may change me, 
but I cant time so fuck it. 
ive been stumblin' 
through these thoughts 
and I thought the fact that I could be delirious. 
but as the audience grows
security knows
stoppin me now is kinda serious
No use in dreadin' 
what they call Armageddon. 
I think we made it through the slump.
But who really cares where we're headin'
cuz now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!! 

[chorus]

so lets make somethin' out of it. 
This way we can all relate. 
Worldwide we collide. 
This is how we communicate. 
So lets make somethin' out of it. 
Whoever thought we would see the day. 
I cant believe we did it. 
So lets drift away. 
We see good things change 
and good things go away.
We see good things waste 
and we taste the pain. 
What we need is 
a place to escape from today. 
Right 
what we need is 
a place to escape from today!! 
right!...
Bring it on..
you wanna be down with the G shock!! 
fuck the glam rock!!
assed out like ken shamrock 
MC's detest me, 
wanna chest to chest me, 
but I aint all about that. 
You gotta be down with the G shock!! 
fuck the glam rock!! 
assed out like ken shamrock!! 
MC's detest me, 
wanna chest to chest me, 
but you don't want none of that 
where we at!
Don't stop!! its 9 teen 90 nine!! [2x]
