Use your vehicle of salvation, my brothers, go buy a gun. 
And go give your gun to Jesus and say  Jesus...
You go kill the deciples of Satan and you kill the nazis, Jesus. 
Gimme an amen. Amen. Gimme a hallelujah, brother. Hallelujah.
Feel the pain of sweet Jesus. Gimme another amen. Amen. Gimme another. Amen.
You've got to kill the noise.
You've got to kill the pollution of Satan, brother, gimme a hallelujah. 
Hallelujah. 
Have you been healed? Have you been saved?
Has it happened to you, brother?
Thank the lord. Praise the lord. I love Jesus. I love Jesus. 
Kill the pollution... pollution
