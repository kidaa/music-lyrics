all the tension in the world today all the little girls fillin up the world today 
with the good comes the bad - the bad comes the good 
but i'm gonna live my life like i should now all the critics 
wanna hit it to shit-can how we did it just 
because they don't get it but i'll stay fitted - 
new era committed now this red cap gets a wrap 
from his critics do we always gotta cry do we always gotta live inside a lie 
life's just a blast, it's movin' really fast you better stay on top 
or life will kick you in the ass follow me into a solo, 
remember that kid so what you wanna do and where you gonna run 
when you're starin' down the cable of a: mic pointed at your grill 
like a gun limp bizkit's rockin' the set it's like russian roulette 
when you're placin' your bet so don't be upset 
when you're broke and you're done 'cause i'm gonna be the one 
till i jet i know why you wanna hate me 
i know why you wanna hate me 
i know why you wanna hate me 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
i know why you wanna hate me 
i know why you wanna hate me now,
i know why you wanna hate me
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
does anyone really know the secret or the combination for this life, 
and where to keep it it's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin' 
but everything happens for a reason i don't even know what i should say,
'cause i'm an idiot, a loser, 
a microphone abuser i analyze every second i exist beatin' up my mind 
every second with my fist and everybody wanna run, 
everybody wanna hide from the gun you can take that ride through this life, 
if you want but you can't take the edge off the knife - 
no sir and now you want your money back but you're denied, 
'cause your brain's fried from the sack and there ain't nothin i can do, 
cause life is a lesson - you learn it when you're through i know 
why you wanna hate me i know why you wanna hate me i know 
why you wanna hate me 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
i know why you wanna hate me 
i know why you wanna hate me now, 
i know why you wanna hate me 
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately 
i know why you wanna hate me
'cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
