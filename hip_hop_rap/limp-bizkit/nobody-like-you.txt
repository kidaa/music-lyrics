I'm convinced that you hate me
You like to see me cry
Its already a proven fact
And you wait and wait on me to die
Its all scary
I find it hard to confide
I want you to see it my way
You give
I take
You say
You want to be away from me 

[Chorus]
You make me
I've got a reason and I want to know
You take me down I've got a reason and I want to know
I'm convinced that you fucked me And your good
You're thin But I wont let her go
I've got my reasons
And I'm not even Away from you
Its time for me to be forgiven
I give my life to you
I lay my life on the line for you

[Chorus]

I got no reason
I got no reason
I got no reason
I got no reason 

[Chorus]
