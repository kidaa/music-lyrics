Clunk - [7x]
Hey mister, elevate that mic like you missed it
You might need to rest up or pump that chest up
Because that mental is fading, ego you overplayed it
You busta
You just can't be trusted
The drama, your mama must've really been disgusted
But you got no clue
Always screaming everybody owes you
Well kid I never did, and never will
It's gone too far
It's gone too far and it's on well it's gone way to far punk
I never did
Well I never did kid
It's gone too far
Fuckin' punks been bringing all the funk in
Knowing you man you're probably not thinking
Got you lips sinking
There it goes flying
Over that head you'll be crying
Lying in your death bed
Now you're just a reject
Showin off at Mc'y D's just to gain a little respect
But you got no clue
Always screaming everybody owes you
Well kid I never did, and never will
It's gone too far
It's gone too far and it's on well it's gone way to far punk
I never did
Well I never did kid
It's gone too far
You need to drop that freakin' ego before you crash
Before the headlights are simply glaring in your eyes and you're goin down
What's the matter with the life that you're leadin'
When you're bleedin' everyone's thinking how much they hate you
It's not to late dude, just that time for you to zip up that girl
Take a deep breath, look around, ain't nobody left
Just a target, bull's eye
Still you walk around in a clown like a clown in a force field
See I'm not crazy, you're the one who's crazy
Institution bound to be the only way that we can even solve this
Had about as much as I can take
So do yourself a favor
I just wanna get it out
I just wanna get it out!!!
