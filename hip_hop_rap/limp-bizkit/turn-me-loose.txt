Fred: check Slim Shady do the mic kid 
Eminem: I dont do black music I dont do white music
I make fight music for high school kids I put lives 
at risk when I drive like this from a slip disk from a Limp 
Bizkit disk I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts so I get 
pissed and cant pick which wrist to slit little rich 
kids in cribs dont attempt this shit so 
step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch so I 
says to the girl I'm like what up girl 
shut up girl showed her a cut up squirel she 
screamed bloody murder so loud everybody 
heard her slapped me in the mouth and called 
me a nutty murderer I moved up to two 
blondes kissin' on a futon yo baby what are 
you on? I looked at 'em both and I was 
like look check this out toots I'm lookin for Cookie

immediately they played my video on MTV last 
week just when I was thinkin' I was 
all that and then some here comes Fred Durst 
Fred: yo Shady let me get someone who 
knows what galaxy I came from one where 
a bass drum hung from my high chair now

fever for the flavor of a single see me and 
Shady I think we got it locked down shocked 
by the sound I got you crusin' with your 
top down these two blondes I offered them 
both a drink and this you would think could 
get the party started but instead the girls 
turned their heads opened up their mouth 
smelled like somebody farted so it was time 
for me to move on Shady said the living 
room was a dance floor so turn me loose I was 
cuttin' the rug with this chick bumped into
this dude who was a drunk and a prick ramblin' 
on about how he was gonna kill me wow! I 
spilled a drink on his shirt but no he insisted 
we should go before I could drop him Shady 
had to clock him the music stopped the 
party stood in shock I looked around grabbed 
the cutest girl and did the smurf. 
Chorus: Turn me loose turn me loose turn me loose
