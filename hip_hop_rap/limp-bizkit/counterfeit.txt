Freakin' me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, 
you're freakin' me out you wear a mask - [5x]
Freakin' me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, 
you're freakin' me out you wear a...fake
Hey man wake up and smell the concrete
Strange to see you've changed like the LB
Could be identity crisis but I can't buy this
Reality bites but that's what life is
Pitiful you, your hideous behavior
Hate what God gave ya, fakin all the flava
Artificial minds seekin out the new trends
Get in where you fit in
Quit thinkin like a has-been diggin in my culture
Let me let your punks know I'm an old school soldier
With the funk flow
A damn shame you wanna change yourself
Because you're sick of yourself
Well I'm sick of you too, fake
You're a, a counterfeit, fake
You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too, fake
You're a, a counterfeit, fake
I wonder, I wonder
I wonder what it's like to be a clone
Doin' nothin, nothin' on my own
Alone in your misery, you're bitin on my new style
Filed as a counterfeit, going down in history as nothin but a copy cat copy cat
So if your fakin that you're phat you need a ballbat
Right where your head is at
All your desperation causes separation
Now I grab the mic to intimidate
Your weakness screams from the limp on your siren
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with funk flick
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain
Because you're sick of yourself
Well I'm sick of you too, fake
You're a, a counterfeit, fake
You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too, fake
You're a, a counterfeit, fake
All these phonies
You disregarded your life disregarded your life
You disrespected your friends you disrespected your friends
You've even stolen your appearance stolen from hangin out with my family
But I should have never dropped my guard shoulda never dropped my guard
So you could stab me in the back stab me in the back
But you were faking me out you were faking me out
Just faking me out you wear a mask you wear a mask
Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, you're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit - 6x
Now you're steadily startin to change
You wanna rearrange your lifestyle with live like the wild child
With the vibe alive you could lie to try and be so fly
A lie but you deny you're a fake
You know we figured you're a phony fake
You know we figured you out fake
You know we figured you out, figured you out, figured you out
Fake [a bunch of times]
