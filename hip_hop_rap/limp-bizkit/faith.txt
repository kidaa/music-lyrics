Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has gotta body like me
But I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showin' you that door
Cuz I gotta have faith
Gotta have faith - [3x]
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
Cuz you're givin' me the blues
Baby, you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you that door
I gotta have faith
Gotta have faith - [3x]
get the fuck up!
I gotta have faith
faith - [2x]
