i just read your letter it says that you'll be gone for a while 
everything was gettin' better i guess i'm just a fool strung 
out what to do life is through just want to kill myself for you 
i wonder just how sympathetic you'll be you've come to take me under 
and i've forgotten all about me what to do 
my life is through just want to kill myself for you so tell me why you say goodbye 
and tell me why your fuckin' up my whole life 
yeah, fuckin' up my whole life so, i'm on my way i leave today 
if i get away it'll be ok it'll be ok i'm looking out a window into a world 
that's taken you from me and i'm feeling so disgusted how pathet-ic 
can i possibly be what to do 
life is through just want to kill myself for you 
so tell me why you say goodbye and tell me why you're fuckin' up 
my whole life fuckin' up my whole life so,
i'm on my way i leave today if i get away 
it'll be ok it'll be ok if there's a better place you can take me a better life 
you can give me whatever place i can start all over then i would 
never need what you gave me never need you to save me
and never feel like this life is over if there's a better place 
you can take me a better life you can give me whatever place 
i can start all over then i would never need what you gave me 
and never need you to save me and never feel like this life is over 
feel like this life is over so, i'm on my way i leave today 
if i can get away it'll be ok it'll be ok
