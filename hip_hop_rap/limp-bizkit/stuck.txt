Psycho female blowin up the phone line
You need to tighten that screw, it's been loose for a long time
I've been slammed with some bad luck
Soon I'm gonna bring you doom with the buck, buck
And now you duck duck goose, I'm lettin' loose
With the thirty odd freestyle
Labeled hostile by my profile
Must be all the madness
You and all your tactics
Jonesin for my cash
Got to make them pockets super phat
Hey I'm a humble man
Kicking out the jams like a tramp
I'm gonna stick it like a stamp to this business
What's with all the business
I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage 
Stay away from all the bros. in my band
And all the fans and
All my friends is when the cash is coming in
Or i'll be slammin them balls to the wall 
With the ink on my flesh and the yes, yes y'all
No 9 to 5, I'll still survive
I keep my engine on that amp like a Chattanooga champ
That's all we need, another bad seed
Planted on this earth motivated by greed
You wanna play that game bitch
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
Boy you wanna play that game bitch
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so...stuck
Stuck deep down in that hole again, stuck you got your brain on my green again
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck in your head you don't even know
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi
Far from suicidal
Still I get them tendencies
Bringing back them memories
That I really miss when I reminisce
Rocking back in the '80's live
My attitude to do or die
Once I was a maggot, now I'm just super fly
Bound for the boundaries
No limits G
Phat ass rhythms driven by my destiny
Your style's in my pocket
Proclaimed to regain that essence
Pressin cause i'm hostile labeled by my profile 
In deed I am I am indeed hostile when it comes to greed 
You wanna play that game bitch
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
Boy you wanna play that game bitch
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so...stuck
Stuck deep down in that hole again, stuck you got your brain on my green again
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck in your head you don't even know
Aw yeah, ain't nutin' like a greedy bitch
Diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' so deep for that green
All I know, all I know, that you must be fucked up in that head
I got a little problem, just one question, beyatch
Why, why you wanna be like that
Why, why you gotta be like that
You wanna be like that
Why, why you wanna be like that - [2x]
Why, why you gotta be like that
Why, why you wanna be like that, why the fuck you wanna be like that
Why, why you gotta be like that, why the fuck you wanna be like that
Why, why, why, why, why you gotta be
Why, why, why, you wanna be like that

Stuck on yourself, you are
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
Stuck on yourself, you whore
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so...stuck
Stuck deep down in that hole again, stuck you got your brain on my green again
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck in your head you don't even know
