How many of you people remember the House Of Pain 
I wanna bring out, my man Poe, from Style Elevish. 
And my man Easy Rock, from the Rock Steady Crew. 
You like break-dancing baby 
Are you ready 
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin. 
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin. 
I won't ever slack up, punks you better back up. 
Try to play the role, and the whole crew will act up. 
Get up, stand up, c'mon put your hands up, 
And if you get the feeling, jump across the ceiling. 
Least with the funk flow, man you talkin' junk yo. 
Bust 'em in the eye, and then I'll take the punks home. 
Feelin, fuckin', man's it's in the junk, 
And I got more ryhmes than the cops at a Dunkin Donuts shop. 
Soon enough I'll get props from the kids in KoRn plus my mom and my pops. 
Came to get down, came to get down, so get your ass up and jump around. 
C'mon, jump around. 
Jump around, get up! 
Jump around, c'mon! 
Jump up, jump up, and get down! 

Jump repeated 16 times! 

I'll slam your ass like John Mckenroe, 
If your bitch steps up.... I'm smackin' the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs. 
Got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms. 
Just like the Radical Son I've returned. 
If anyone's steppin' to me you get burned. 
Fuck your lyrics, cause you ain't got none. 
And if you wanna battle then bring a... shotgun
Well if you do you're a fool, cause I'll put fools to death. 
Try to step to me, you take your last breath. 
I got the skill, man I got your fill. 
Cause when I shoot, man, I shoot to kill. 
Came to get down, I came to get down, 
So get your ass up and jump around. 
C'mon. Jump around! 
Jump around everybody! 
Jump around, it's your last chance! 
Jump up, jump up to get down! 

Jump repeated 16 times! 

Everybody jump! 
We'll see ya next year baby!
