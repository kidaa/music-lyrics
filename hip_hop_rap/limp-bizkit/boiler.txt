looks like i'm gonna do everything myself 
maybe i could use some help but hell, 
you want something done right you gotta do it yourself 
maybe life is up and down but my life's been what 
till now i crawled up your butt somehow and that's 
when things got turned around i used to be alive 
now i feel pathetic and now i get it what's done is done you just leave it alone 
and don't regret it but sometimes, 
some things turn into dumb things 
and that's when you put your foot down. 
why did i have to go and meet somebody like you like you 
why did you have to go and hurt somebody like me like me 
how could you do somebody like that 
like that hope you know that i'm never coming back never coming back
