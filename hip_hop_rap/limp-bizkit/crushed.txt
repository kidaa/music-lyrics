It's Limp Bizkit! 
And this is how we learn. 
You can't talk to me. 
You're not supposed to be, in my face. Get the fuck outta my face!. 
Why do you insist, you gotta talk that shit, 
You gotta keep that dog ass breath, all up in my face. 
I remember when, you would never lie to a friend. 
Cause you were so high, you were so shy, you were so fucked up anyway. 
Life keeps on tickin', tickin', tickin' into the future. 
Cause this is how we learn. 

chorus 
Somebody better stop me. 
Or at least stop this beat, 
Before we start gettin' out of hand.
Cause this is how we learn. 
And this is how we burn. 
Somebody better stop me, 
Or at least stop this beat, 
Before we start gettin' out of hand. 
Cause this is how we learn. 
And this is how we burn. 

You can't erase me. 
I'm alive as I can be, in your face. 
So get the fuck outta my face! 
Why you insist, it's gotta turn out like this, 
It's gotta burn out like this all up in my face. 
I remember how, you said you want it all and you want it now. 
Cause you were so young, you were so dumb, 
You were so fucked up anyway. 
Life keeps on tickin', tickin' tickin' into the future. 
Cause this is how we learn. 

chorus

Think about it. 
Think about it. 
Oh my! Where you at 
Come on. 
I know you're feeling it baby. 
I know you're feeling it. 
Come on. 
Bring the beat baby repeated 4x. 

I said this is how it should be done. 
This is how it should be done. 
Cause my style, is identical to none. 
Outta here! 
I'm gettin' the hell outta here. 
Limp Bizkit style. 
Hey Lethal, wait up.
