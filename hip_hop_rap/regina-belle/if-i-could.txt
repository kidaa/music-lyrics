Ooh...ooh...
Ooh...
Oh...ho...
Yeah, yeah

If I could
Id protect you from the sadness in your eyes
Give you courage in a world of compromise
Yes, I would

If I could
I would teach you all the things Ive never learned
And Id help you cross the bridges that Ive burned
Yes, I would

If I could
I would try to shield your innocence from time
But the part of life I gave you isnt mine
Ill watch you grow, so I can let you go

If I could
I would help you make it through the hungry years
But I know that I can never cry your tears, babe
But I would If I could

If I could
In a time and place where you dont wanna be
You dont have to walk along this road with me
My yesterday wont have to be your way

If I knew
Id try to change the world I brought you to
Now there isnt much more that I can do
But I would If I could

If I could
I would try to shield your innocence from time
But the part of life I gave you isnt mine
Ill watch you grow, so I can let you go

If I could
Id help you make it through the hungry years
But I know that I can never cry your tears
But I would If I could

Eah...hey...eah...hey...hey...
If I could
