Ive seen your face before
Somewhere, somehow, I know
Of that Im sure
You turned and smiled at me
And started something I, never thought would be
I wish that you and I could meet again, someday
Ive never felt this way for anyone else
No Baby

Chorus
This is love
This is love
Ooo I think Im falling for you
This is love
Only love
Nobody makes me feel like you do
No one but you

I know that it takes time
For love to grow this far
But still Ill wait
Youre all Im thinking of
All of dreaming of
I need you so much
I pray that heaven will guide us so that we can be together again
Till the end of time
Just you and I
You loving me and me loving you

Chorus

Ive been a lot of places that I never knew
But none compare with you
And more of you, you will never know
This time baby, theres no letting go, yeah

Chorus
