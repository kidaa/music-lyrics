Ooh, hoo...yeah
Mmm, hmm

Tired of living life in black and white
Theres so much in between
Like a rainbow in the sky
Crying to be seen

When I open my eyes to find inspiration
I search for the best I can see
If I settle for less
I wont be the best I can be

 When I dream, I dream in color
I want a love, not just a lover
Ill give you so many good reasons
To capture a dream, yeah, yeah

Life is short, but cant be bought, mmm
And time is a very precious thing
I want to go to where Ive never been
And see whats never been seen

In the midst of the morning I wont take for granted
Therell always be another new day
Got to live for each moment
Never let time slip away

When I dream, I dream in color
I want a love, not just a lover
Ill give you so many good reasons
To capture a dream, whoa...

If I was unaware, if I didnt care
About people and places and things
How could I live a life full and satisfied
Now knowing how to dream
When I dream, oh, yeah

When I dream, I dream in color
I want a love, not just a lover
Show me a child who never has seen
A vision that shows what his life really means
Ill give you so many good reasons
To capture a dream
A dream
