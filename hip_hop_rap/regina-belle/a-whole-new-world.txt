I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid.
Tell me princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder,
Over sideways and under, on a magic carpet ride

A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming.
A whole new world,
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you.

Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world, / Don't you dare close your eyes,
A hundred thousand things to see. / Hold your breath it gets better.
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far,
I can't go back to where I used to be / A whole new world,
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming.
A whole new world,
Every turn a surprise,
With new horizons to pursue / every moment red-letter.
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world / A whole new world
That's where we'll be / That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me.
