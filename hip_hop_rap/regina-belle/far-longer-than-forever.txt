If I could break this spell, I'd run to him today 
And somehow I know he's on his way to me 
Derek, you and I were meant to be 

Far longer than forever 
I'll hold you in my heart 
It's almost like you're here with me 
Although we're far apart 

Far longer than forever 
As constant as a star 
I close my eyes and I am where you are 

Sure as the dawn brings the sunrise 
We've an unshakable bond 
Destined to last for a lifetime and beyond 

Far longer than forever Far longer than forever 
I swear that I'll be true I swear that I'll be true 
I've made an everlasting vow 
To find a way to you 

Far longer than forever 
Like no love every known 
And with your love I'll never be alone 

Far longer than forever 
Much stronger than forever 
And with your love I'll never be alone
