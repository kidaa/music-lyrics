When I left you tonight 
Well you looked so good, baby 
There was moonlight in your hair 
And God only knows how I hated to leave you 
Just standing there 
I could've held you forever and ever 
But the moment wasn't right 
So I let go and took off for another lonely night 
Now I'd like to spend my life with you 
So now tell me is that so wrong 
Cause I'd never have to say good-bye to you 
I could hold you all night long 

Do you wanna get serious 
Or do I have the right to ask you 
You wanna get serious 
Don't you wanna be in love 
Do you wanna get serious 
I know we're taking chances on the two of us 
Do you wanna get serious 
Do you wanna get serious 
All day long I've been thinking about it 
I'm ready to give in 
'Cause I'd hate to lose something 
I might never find again 
Nobody's ever made me want 
To do what I'm gonna do 
For once in my life, I have just what I need 
And it's all wrapped up in you 
Now I'd like to spend my life with you 
So now tell me is that so wrong 
'Cause I'd never have to say good-bye to you 
I could hold you all night long
