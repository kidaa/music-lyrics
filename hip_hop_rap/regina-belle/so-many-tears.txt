Dee da da dee da da

Sat down to write you a letter
Promised Id write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That I dont even know what to say

I dont know where to start
Dont know how to begin

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now here I am and its ending
Trying to find as it was to you

 I dont know where to start it
Dont know how to begin
And I dont even cry anymore at night
Cause I dont think that anyone hears

All that is heard when its late at night
Are my tears, are my tears
So many tears
So many tears

Someone is being so loveless
Theres jealousy played its part
Brand new begin, but I dont understand
Trying purposely to break my heart

I dont know where it started
Dont know why it began

Was it my ??? or something
Why did you make life so tough
Swore that Id love you only
But it never seems to be enough

I dont even know where it started
Dont know why it began
And I dont even cry anymore at night
Cause I dont think that anyone hears

All that is heard when its late at night
Are my tears, so many tears
So many tears
So many tears

Its hard, so hard to watch you
Destroy what took so long to find
You say that you care about mine
Tell me when did you stop caring for mine

???I hold on faithfully???
Each night was always the same
My request must have gone on deaf ears
Cause the answer never came and thats why

I dont even cry anymore at night
Cause I dont think that anyone hears

All that is heard when its late at night
Are my tears, are my tears
So many tears
So many tears So many tears

No...
Sat down to write you a letter
Promised Id write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That theres only one thing left to say

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

I dont even know where it started
Or know how it began
So many tears

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now our love is ending
And I have so many tears
So many tears

And I dont even cry anymore at night
And I dont think that anyone hears
So many tears
I have so many tears
