OOOh oooo......

I will endure...... all the tide,
Hold together, in the worst conditions
For at birth, we knew it to be one of a kind

mmm mmm

And as it grew, into, this lovers legend
We both made sure, this piece of heaven
Would withstand any test, for its strength, was made of love, faith and trust........

CHORUS:
And until all the glitter's gone
We'll be adding on, to make it even stronger
True love will never die, long after the love has lost its shine

After its all tired and worn and the newness all wears off
We'll still be lovers

Several time a weakspot, will appear in this affair,
We remended it back together, with tender loving care
A promise to each other, that's last out through the years
It's as solid as the first time, cause its still loving well.......

CHORUS Here

Woooooooo ...ooooh

Oh yeah......

Nah......... no no no no nah no

Oh....

CHORUS Here

Its all tired and worn and the newness all wears off
We'll still be lovers,
Long after the love has lost its shine.
