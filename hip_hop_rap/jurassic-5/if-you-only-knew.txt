[Chali 2na]
Never think just for
Shits and giggles
Do we spit sylable riddles
For bits and kibbles
So chics can wiggles and shake
Cause this image is fake

[Akil]
I'm tryin hard to relate
In a place filled with so much hate

[Soup]
Some brothers debate
Some love or some hate
Whatever the case
Its all about the choices you make
That's the reason your balloon'll deflate

[Chali 2na]
But to relate
We tryin' to take rap back to its primitive state, wait

[Marc 7]
No overnight success or runnin' with vets
Just pure unadulterated work progress
I'm willin' to bet the farm
You'd give your right arm
For a piece of the pie
Ask yourself, Why

[Chorus:]
[All]
If you only knew
The trials and tribulations we been through
But if you only knew
We're real people homey, just like you
We humble, but don't mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do, is try to give you what you ain't used to
[Marc 7]
Soul music, somethin' we can all relate to

[Akil]
Yo yo, I ams what I am and thats all I can be
Uh, no more no less what you're seein' is me
Akil the emcee dubbed the U-I-S-C, uh
Wise, intelligent, God did bless me

[Soup]
Yes we, rock up off the S-B freshly
Especially dangerous rough and deadly

[All]
The pimp positioner, tip the Richter...Scale

[Chali 2na]
Alone we sink together we sail and prevail
The rum raisin comin through guns blazin'
Some of you duns runnin' ones with none savin'
Complainin', me and my clan are unscathen
From the soul comes somethin' amazin'

[Chorus]

[talking in background]

[Akil]
Yo, how many times I got to hear
Some fanatic in my ear
Tellin' me I got to keep it real
When they ain't payin' my bills
Or feedin' my kids, judgin' me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

[Marc 7]
Have you forgetten who you are
Oh, you think yo a star
Why you frontin' You ain't nothin'
You went from nothin' to somethin'
But somethin' means nothin' if ya people still wantin'

[Chali 2na]
And ya got money and givin' them nothin'

[All]
Flossin' and frontin'

[Soup]
Ya game of sharades
The way you behave
The image you save
Yeah brother thats one big parade
I'm sick of your ways
I'm sittin here spittin a phrase
Next time they smile and they wave
They probably be with a gaze

[Chorus]

[Marc 7]
Soul..soul..soul..soul..soul
