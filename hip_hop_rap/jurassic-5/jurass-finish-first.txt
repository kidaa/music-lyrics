[Charli 2na]
Yo, because of cash in the purse, guns blast in the hearse
A vast universe when the last is the first
The past been a curse, I need some asprin to nurse
It's your casket in earth, or my ass when it hurts
A passionate burst of some last-minute work
First the human bodies are living last in this Earth
Puffing grass when it works, a bastard at birth
But at last planet Earth, 5 Jurass finish first
Stashed in this verse Burning like gas on a torch
Graspin' a thought Some don't see past their front porch
Masked in a smirk No doubt my class been alert
Verbal splash for your thirst, 5 Jurass finish first

[Marc 7even]
Yo, because of crooks in the game no one's acting the same
Not mentioning no names, merely passing the blame
Your ass been in flames since the cash went ka-chang
Now you can't stand the rain when my crew bring the pain
You a masculine myth who I constantly diss
As I bond with the Fish, understand we the 5th
Platoon, hit the dirt, wish you well, wish you worse
Your ass been cursed, 5 Jurass finish first

Bringing it back from the lost, we have to report
The trash on the chart make you have to resort
To leave the record store instead of quenching your thirst
But at last planet Earth, 5 Jurass finish first

[Charli 2na]
Yo, because of passing the course wife asking divorce
Taking half of your cash, now you bask in remorse
Turning rap into sport, I've mastered the part
Cause the trash on the chart leave you gaspin for art
Now if you've mastered the art, I'm askin with force
To mass of your thoughts, to your ass is a corpse
Cover grass in a burst, unfasten your purse
Give your cash to the clerk, 5 Jurass finish first

[Marc 7even]
Yeah, cause of tricks of the trade, some are virtual slaves
A smirk will get raised once the pen hits the page
While your thoughts of the stage and perhaps getting paid
Relax in the shade, time passing in days
I'm searching for ways to avoid the charade
Cause when voices are laid, choices are made
Be not afraid, people plastic on Earth
Verbal blast bout to burst, 5 Jurass finish first

5 Jurass finish first [Repeat 2x]

[Charlie 2na]
Yo, because of passing the torch, puffing pipes with a bouche
You a hype living loose with your life in the noose
You invite many fools when you ligt chemicals
Night of the living ooze, your ego makes many bruise

[Marc 7even]
You need to watch what you choose, what you give is what you get
Some are lacking intellect in their quest for a check
Is it love or respect, does the subject get you vexed
Only 4 bars to wreck, the situation is complex

[Charlie 2na]
Yo, you in constant pursuit to be the last in the house
Where's your wallet With the wife, deep stashed in her blouse

[Mark 7even]
Like "Without a Doubt" you can catch me on the B-side
Cause the one who wins the war...

[Charlie 2na]
...is the one without pride
J5 make you feel a lickle gaseous at first
[Martin Lawrence] And yes I make you ask "Is that Lurch"
Either try this or lyrical madness that works
Give your cash to the clerk, 5 Jurass finish first
