Without A Doubt

You know we turn the party out Without a doubt
And show em what it's about Without a doubt
We'll win whether you like it or not Without a doubt
We make it hot Without a doubt Repeat 2x

We keep it heated like stones in Hell's Kitchen
MC's are wishing that they had a pot to piss in

[Akil]
Akil is on a mission to smash the competition
I whip my opposition with words into a sentence
And combat your verbal attacks with no assistance
I'm too consistant for you brothers to keep bitching
Pay close attention to my verbal composition
I keep it distant like my love for the business
You ask "What is this? Is it real or ficticous?"
I kill the wise and intelligent rebels with percision

[Charlie 2na]
It's a true conspiracy, battle for world supremecy
Huh, send me brothers they maybe try to contend with me
But me and my staff soon shine like a perfect half moon
And get you open like a public bathroom, paragraph doom
The vicious lyric solicitor
No comission keeping it different for my listeners
Taking no prisioners, sealing perimeters
Never singular, giving you something that you remember

You know we turn the party out Without a doubt
And show em what it's about Without a doubt
We'll win whether you like it or not Without a doubt
We make it hot Without a doubt Repeat 2x

We reccomend Jurassic 5 like daily check-ups
From waist to your neck up, so next man step up

[Marc 7even]
You're now the victim of a vocal verbal stick up
My style will make you get up and down just like a sit up
To those who want to get us, brother keep your chin up
What up? I roll with winners, beyond beginners
The average nigger squeezes triggers when your rap style's bigger
How you figure that you can disrespect my art?
I know the true MC's take this life to heart
Let's take it back to the start, Donnie Dew kick your part

[Zaakir]
And it's the outlaw about to rock y'all, now watch my hands go
Over the nickle full black tainted pearl handle
And watch it richocet, captivate the airwaves
Hit you with the ever blade connected with the wordplay
Mister Pro-fessional with the clever flows
Hear it on your radio, Donnie Brasco
With the defness, and the ways of the West
Represent the flavor breathless

You know we turn the party out Without a doubt
And show em what it's about Without a doubt
We'll win whether you like it or not Without a doubt
We make it hot Without a doubt Repeat 2x

Uh, no doubt, when J5 comes, that's right
