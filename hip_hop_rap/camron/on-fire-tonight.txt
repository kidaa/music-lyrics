[Verse:]
I need a girl who can sing like Celina
A** like Trina
Tits like Janet
Get beat like Tina
Have u seen her
I mean, caked like Oprah
chauffeur...
Keep the toast in the toaster
Tell me have you seen her
I did...
Yeah I found one
A little brown one
Then she down son
Cuz she pushed the beamer
I should have knew something was up from the jump
When I passed ma the blunt
The b***h was a steamer 
I aint kiddin i had weed to blow
I aint feed the ho
We took a trip to Argentina
I dont know why i died 
But pours i went fours inside the wh*re
I found she wasnt cleaner
Dirty b***h burnt me
That concerned me
Now I'm thirsty 
I'm looking for a looking meaner
I'm gonna kill her when I see her 
So tell me, have u seen her
Tell me, have u seen her

[chorus]
It's the girls with the pretty face
And the pretty bras
Pretty thighs
But what about the inside
And that b***h is a lair and I, I took the condom off and now it's on fire tonight...
It's the girls with the pretty face
And the pretty bras
Pretty thighs, but what about the inside
And that b***h is a lair and I, I took the condom off and now it's on fire tonight...

[Verse:]
It's like treat her like a prostitute
Don't treat no girlie good don't show her yo loot
Girl i see u riding wanna roll in the coo
See you with ice cream
Want to go for a scoop
I don't get mad
Tell her to blow on my flute
Before the i.e. you got it thrown on your crew
Droopy, sad, i read it, whooee I'm glad u done it 
Sue me, what chu mad I said it
From front back side to side
Never let a broke a** female ride
I learned that down south from n***as in Texas
Before I drink up I big up big guesses
Imagine me get up against this
Get her a Lexis
You're figuring ... reckless
Baby I'm sexist
So back up, let me strap up before you give
Cam that clap up I'm gon have to clack up
[Zeek speaking]
And why that nigga still going broke
This is for my n***as out there that DO use a condom
For the first night...
Then go brawl all the other times
Where the psychological sense in that playa
You need to wash your face, get your mind right
Girls up here is burning
B***h burnt the braids off my n***a the other week....
Yeah, yeah, I know what to do
I'm gonna get the p***y ATM started
Before anything happens your gotta swipe your p***y across this board
Let you know what's going on
What type of temperature you running
Cuz I can't stand n***as running out here to the clinic sitting down talking bout 'I aint
nuttin Zeek, I'm over here gettin condoms'
N***a, I seen you break the door down running to the nurse talking bout help me, help ME
You damn right imma help you
Imma hang your stupid a** right in front of the damn clinic 

[Chorus in background]
The hell you gon come running 'my girls got a venereal decease
Huh! her p***y lighting up like a light bulb...'
Talking about a light bulb...
Sh**
A light bulb
Tell you what, engineer, venereal decease is going on down there
It's crazy...
Ladies is crazy
I'm gonna write a book on how stupid n***as is

[Chorus]
