[verse 1]
mami all on me cause i'm touchin' her belly
i'm on butter pirelli's

and what else and i got hella gear

uh tomato porsche lookin' like tomato sauce
hip hop hooray i got to get
that yayo off
thats blocks to the ave, cops come blocking the 
ave, i put the glock in the stash, slabs and copped in the trash
still stop and i laugh, ma put

ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself
and my weight of the wealth was SK, AK, mayday, payday dog 
don't play with your health.

[chorus]

i get fresh from
yankee stadium to the garden i beg your pardon

burp let the dirt chase me
every third lady that flirt, want my chirp lately i know
some rn's that still strip, when i and this real dick, in

at least after your bid, ain't no student loans

and ask are you alone

[chorus]

[verse 3]
we race foriegn cars, customed models, drop top mustard tahoe
we like the musketeers, trained by cus d'amato
just a model, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow
watch sanford in son
i'm like the buzz in rolo
afourtuniado, the porsche apollo, wars a follow
got the mack jack, still swing swords like zorro
we jackin' and clappin' yall just applaud like bravo
now i plaud the cappo, zeke and santana
i don't razor wrist's
i keep eighths of piff
the games and the chick
like kobe imma rape the bitch
razor grips, laser spit, glock cocked j or fifth
d on the block just like jadakiss
haters shift, plead the fifth, spray
the fifth, gator kicks, ma-tr-ix, major chips, i'm your favorite.....killa
dipset, dipset

[chorus]
