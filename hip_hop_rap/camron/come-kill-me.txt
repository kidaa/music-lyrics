[Verse 1] 
Yo subliminal thoughts, 107th street, criminal court 
Pissy drunk up in here, Gordon, Gin the court 
It's like a biscuit, judging my dick though, case acquitted 
When it's dough I do whatever it takes to get it 
So, chain danglers, are in danger 
When I skate wit ya ice like the Rangers, assume later 
Boss bitch though, goin out like Tomb Raider 
Booth razors, a few blazers, who raised him 
He speak Eboni-, me and my goddaughter C-Hanni 
Come through with the mean Tommy, ask you if you seen mommy 
And she three feet behind me 
Why my whole life is like the repeat of Gahndi 
Me and G O D, from C O C, like got dough C O D 
A S A P, A S A P 
Play me, you crazy, and your mother ass fat 
So I laid her on her stomach bust your brothers on her back 
Never rubber on or cap, I'm a raw specialist 
Make me more devilish, me and my whores never kiss 
Though, motherfucker we was prone to die 
Just my green top, yo we own inside, motherfucker 

HOOK: 
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up 
We gon ball till we fall, gon ride in the five 
Keep pies in our eyes, stay high til we die 
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up 
We keep a clip in our shit, keep a brick on the trip 
Keep a chick in the whip, gettin licked the six 

[Verse 2] 
Ayo they used to call me "Work Out" 
Cuz before I brought my work out, I used to work out 
Niggas wanna make deals, na na I want work out 
Now murk out, before you get cursed out 
Bangin they fun, same as the sun 
Hidin from the church when you slang to the nuns 
Chumps come through with giraffe and orangatang guns 
Vetty vest, you petty theft, you seem soft 
I'm seven judges up in Supreme Court 
Mean thoughts all over a teen porch 
Wait, don't have to tell you shit 
Matter fact, pat him down, who the hell you wit? 
Yo you wack money, wait around all day for pack money 
Get a gold chain talkin bout you bout to have money 
But everything's gonna to be all right, why 
Cuz every ring's gonna be all ice and 
You wanna kill me come and do it I don't give a fuck 
Diplomats live it up, clak, clak, give it up

Yo, talkin bout he gon' touch somethin [He won't bust nothing] 
Yo sayin that he too much frontin [He won't bust nothing] 
Yo, he just a fake thug bluffin [He won't bust nothing] 
And his man with the ice grill frontin [He won't kill nothing]

Not a collecter of Picasso, but everybody in my scepter got dough 
Neglect a rock row, go to charve and not dough ho 
But Hector, Comancho, mi amigo rockin in the side bitch 
?Maxin out to Marvin?, can't know it

Club grand open, next week we grand close it, come and kill me 

Get the fuck outta here! This shit is fuckin closed! 
Get the fuck outta here motherfucker I'll kill you!
