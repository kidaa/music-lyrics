Hey ma, what's up, lets slide, all right, all right
And we get it on tonight
You smoke, I smoke, I drink, me too, well good
Cause we gon get high tonight
Got drops, got Coups, got Trucks, got juice, all right
Cause we gon take a ride tonight
So ma, what's up, let's slide, all right, all right
And we gon get it on tonight

[Juelz Santana]
Yo, Now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty she was crazy right
And I approach baby like
Ma, What's your age and type
She looked at me and said use a baby right
I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me come stay the night
She looked at me laughin', like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin' back like show you right
Get in the Car
And don't touch nothing Sit in the car
Let discuss Somethin'
Either we lovin' or I'll see you tommorow
Now we speeding up the Westside
Hand creepin' up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Now That I got a girl, my Ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like Cam stop frontin'
On that Dave Hollister Tip
Come over lets swallow and sip
I'm like momma that's it
I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks
They all say I'm rotten and rich
But not her, booby's real
High heel dooby feel, plus got them Gucci nails, uh
You a cutie still, and this my down girl too
Ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzies, Suzuki wheels,
To the Jocose, I tell you my booby's real
I mean she do be winning, luey spinnin
Go to the crib she got the Gucci linen'
I see booby grinning
She looked and said Cam, I know that you be sinning
Naw, I'm a changed man, look at the range maim
I got a whole new game plan
Looked and said that's nothing but game Cam
She was right; she was up in the Range man
Droped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right I had to call up L
[Cam And Juelz Together]
You L, what up, I hit, what else, plus dome, say word
And we got it on tonight

[Chorus]
