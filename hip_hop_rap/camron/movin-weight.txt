Cam'ron: 
Chorus 
Why I feel like I'm losin' weight 
Why I ain't got no money, less I'm movin' weight 
Why my life depend on what I'mma do today 
Why I can't move away 
It's just you and me, without the scrutiny, 
bitches screwin' me, 2 and 3 truencies 
4 shots, 1 toolie G, 1 uliogy 
Make sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls 
Before a nigga under the world 

When I was 10 got the truly dict, My uncle pulled me to the side 
And he schooled me quick, told me son gooey- spit 
You can't get paid in a earth this big, you worthless kid 
Niggas don't deserve to live, go and get a motherfucker 
if he murder kids, bottle up carbohydrates and preservatives 
He got hit up that same night 
Ever since my flow, my dough, and my hoe game been tight 
Puns of pearls, yo tounge will twirl, listen here 
Booger bear, I'll have you up in hooker gear,I swear 
I was doin', Lex persuin', niggas wired like Western Union 
Short like next to Ewing, head for truent, his set was ruined 
Phony checks was fluent, listen hear me out 
I'm from a cocaine block, with some plain clothes cops 
Where the sun don't rise, but the rain don't stop 
The pain don't stop, but my reign don't stop 
Ain't no lockouts, the game don't stop 
Every month you change yo locks, change yo spots 
Get a little smart, want to change yo rocks 
Rearrange yo tops you got a gang of friends, money 
You got Ben's arraign money, yeah Ben ?? money 
But if I get knocked, I ain't got no bail 
But I come on the weekend, from Pablo's jail 
See I came a long way that's livin' the wrong way 
That's sniffin' the po-na, that's sippin' the cog-na, hey 
You wanna be a star, you have ya own day 
>From where they play ball, drink and get buzzed 
Reminiscin' on what a good kid he was 
I don't know what happened, all he did is what he loved 
That's when you opposin' me, killa get the rosary 
Fuck this rap shit, I'll die for mine, motherfucker 

ChorusProdigy: 

Prodigy: 
I'm around yall, it's goin' down yall 
murder rap, clown niggas back down yall 
Straight like that, yall niggas fuck around yo 
Bandana P, blow thirds, the four take you on all fours 
Thug shit, I keep a beamed out fifth 
Is you fiend out bitch, catch a gleamed bullet 
I live the street life ya heard, guns money and birds 
Get dead armed and dead on ya jewels and pearls 
Where I was placed, put between the wrong style thun 
Capital P, you know whats the outcome 
Bout some, but never put out the stout guns 
Don't let ya mouth get you in some shit ya legs run from 
For all the killa's and the 100 dollar hoes 
Who real ??? check me out though 
The most ill, more drama than Denzel 
More liver than the park fights at Sunny Carson 
Me and Killa Cam, live at the carbon 
it's crazy, niggas throwin' they shit 
and niggaz flashin' crazy
