[Verse 1]
I be like Move........Get out the way
Cuz I move bricks, get out the yay
And it's 2 clips, I get out the play man!
Fo a few chips, I get out n' spray Bla-kow!
It's more then shrimps, it's whores and pimps pimps
The difference in our crimes, yours attempts
Attempt burglary, attempt theft you just begun
I'm Grand Theft Auto, rackets here, Larceny, Conspiracy
Murder one, electric chair I don't deserve the fun
But I get the dough, shit I might splurger one
Now I know alotta styles, some see
But listen, stop it child it's a done dee
I come to ya block, stop and style it's that one vee
Gators straight from +Crocodile Dundee+
No rubber sold, hardwood bastard
Fitted, Legitted, +Hardwood Classic+
Killa! Uh!
Leave me alone.....I just like to live my life
Uh, That shit you talk don't move me nadda
The dudes with the Qs be proper
Uzi pop, you news and choppers
It's truly lava, who knew we prosper
The game's a bitch, who we gotta
The shoes, Louie products, Groupie Blah Blah
Santana, Zeek the koofie popper
We the movie shotta!
But it's really rude boys and rosters
When they trendin' all the girls, excuse me shoppa
I wish my homie could watch me
Live happy days like Tony and Chachi
I stay lonely and cocky
DICE!!!
Rollin' and rollin' 'em
Cars, the repo are towin' 'em
Acts black, we totally total 'em
Even blood, he totally totaled it
Plus his life, he totally totaled it
But any girl I get I totally open 'em
Brain in they legs, coke and the dope in 'em

[Bridge]

Killa! Yo uh..
Leave me alone....I just like to live my life
I spend days on kawasakis
Nights with Lewinskies
But I'm the like the Ice Man, Michael Kiplenski
I style on New York, power my fort
Dips, consorted by the sun, ? York
Doggie, cuz I push weight, plus I push tapes
God damn I'm starvin' and I just ate
I wouldn't say I'm meano with +Tha Carter+
I'm more like the plant in +Little Shop Of Horrors+
But I don't say Feed Me Seymour
I say Feed me Dame, Feed me Leeyor Billions!
Epic, they used to feed me detours Pfft!
Roc-A-Fella, they feed me C-4
The way I blow up, the VS Gizz 4
You GS3? I'm GS4
You in a Lexus, I'm gon' stream forward
Up in the sky on the Gulf Stream tour
You want beef? We'll start a Gulf Stream war
Lay ya ass down on God's Green Floor
We playin' Golf in the Gulf Of New Mexico
Tha Cost to be the boss, you gotta respect it, ho
My gas game you gotta respect it tho
I swear to god you think I'm workin' for +Texaco+
And ya section know when any day Techs could blow
Hit 'em from head to toe, When I come deck ya hoe
Killa! Dipset Bitch!
