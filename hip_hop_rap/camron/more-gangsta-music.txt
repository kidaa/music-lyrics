[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
I'm on the southside of Chicago lookin for a real hoe
I dont see a touchdown, arms up feild goal
Got some ill gold, diamonds thats still low
Lil dick you a dickhead, nah dildo
I chill though, pippin in the Range
All this icin I'm ashamed, look like lightnin' in the chain
Who was first that moved wit they fam who
Ask you, tattoos on they hand who
Slang all the white who cruise wit the tan who
Pink on they back who blue in they van who
Yellow on his ear who steam on the rock who
Puple in the air who green in his pocket
I aint dissin you dog, I'm dismissin you
Get the R. Kelly tape and see how we piss on you
Thats Kool-Aid, Moutain Dew, and Cris on you
Ya family will be missin you, theres a kiss for you

[Hook]
