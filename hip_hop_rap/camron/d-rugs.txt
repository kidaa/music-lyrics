[Cam'ron]

This song is about young children
who live in single family homes and
their mother or father chooses their 
boyfriend or girlfriend over you. Remember
parents, kids don't ask to be born. So I'm tell this
story and it starts back in '88.

Yo, this nigga named d-rugs
My moms dates him
Swear to God I hate him
If I could I would break him
When he comes around, her brain sizzles like a Steakum
Damn, can't jakes take him
She neglected me
Run around with this punk nigga recklessly
Had him in her tounge
Guess she was in ectasy
For her love
Took the best of me
O-d'd excessively 
That's her boyfriend 
Or her toyfriend see
Let me specify 
The last man 
Took the money
Left the guy
Desert dry
And gave it to d-rugs
He kept her high
Runnin around 
He's a facial
Smelled like a fragrance
She sniffed it in her nasal
Beggin her to listen
I told her he ain't faithful
Fuckin wit Aunt Rachel
Ya'll so dumb
Makin me look disgraceful
He got a girl named Hazel
And another white one
But wit him
he ain't racial

[Chorus]
I'm your mother 
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga 
In the alley
I'm your doctor 
When in need
I'm your Coke
I'm your Weed
You know me
I'm your friend
Your main boy
Thick and thin
I'm that monster in your dreams
For my love 
You will feen.

[Cam'ron]
What the deal dun
It's '91
Moms still strung
On this nigga d-rugs
His game's tight
Every night she tries to go pursue him
Then she screws him
But my man Un knew him
Schooled me to him
Said he got mad hoes
He used to pimp him
Said he can get you mad doe
What you mean
He just ain't wit your mother
He's got other partners
He's a foreigner though
The cops don't like
Illegal alien 
Can't even say his name on the phone
But you can get money with him
Then leave him alone
Or you'll be inside the new cuffs
Plus a news rush
Said some more about him
Then he introduced us
Took me to the block where everybody get him off
Showed me his clientele
Ever since--Hit it off
He was right
D-rugs got dumb freaks
Men and women love him
Got him 10 grand in one week.

[Chorus]

[Cam'ron]
Now it's 98 
D-rugs, he payed me well
500 S-E-L
Got me land in A-T-L
It's all swell
Way before a felony
But now that we together
It seems that moms in jealous
Cause he wit me now
And everyone time I g him
But when it comes to her
She even pay to see him
Eh yo, money excites me
But my niggas on the block
They got shysty
Cause I'm wit d-rugs
They don't like me
Tried to snipe me
Right before the damn feds had indicted
And my mother 
Her nostrils wide
Too much of d-rugs left her hospitalized
We both was arrested
Stars of the block
Her by cardiac
Me by the cops
But for my mother
Man there's nothin but love
But that's what we get--Fuckin wit Drugs.

[Chorus]
