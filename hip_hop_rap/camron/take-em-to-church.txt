This that Harlem Music Right Here.

This that Diddy Bop, Get ready for the winter music.

That's what it is.

Killa, Dip Set,

[Cam'Ron Verse]
Uh, Uh
You know me dawg, i just wanna keep the peace
But saying my name, that's only gonna lead to beef
Tell my niggas chill, but they wanna heat the streets Be Easy
Or do all the records, Check-it who spit beef to heat

[Juelz Santana Verse]
Everybody Welcoming this, Welcoming that
He wasn't welcome in the first place, how we welcome him back?
Give me the Mac, let me welcome with that
Tell Mr. Rogers, I leave his brains on the trolley track
Now prolly that

[Cam'Ron Verse]
Listen, ya'll Stop It Stop
Know you appalled dotted
But this my call by the force prophet, all profit all profit
Harlem Hustler yep, I can't at all knock it nope
But you hard, when you go in the lord's pocket.
What you offering, put it, write an offer in
They take it all, Cash, Credit, Silver, down to porcelin
Look at the Porsche he's in look at it
Then Give them portioning To Who?
No handicap, Annie Rag, orphan friends
Friends, but the sizzurp I'm drinking on
Birds I'm thinking on
Get your Kirk Franklin on
Word, so you get your Ben Franklin on
Just when you think it's wrong
One blink, he's gone damn

[Chorus]
Father Forgive us
We gon take him to church
Father Forgive us
And it's the truth it hurts
Father Forgive us
And that won't work
No, No, No, No, No Way

[Cam'Ron 2nd verse]
Yo, you try to handle us
Get on the air and damage us
Screaming out Harlem huh like you ain't just a fan to us Where you been at?
Well let me fill you in, now it's a whole clan of us
Blink so mad, he went and beat up Canibus
Zeke got shot then Zeke locked up then
E got killed what else? B popped up
But B hopped up and still broke out his chest
On probation, Doe on house arrest what up Doe
Right out the flesh
Sit in a house and rest
He don't pout, get him gear, in the house he fresh Fresssh
Not that you care, just getting clear and think
One glare and wink
Everyone wearing pink
I'm the reason that your two rings are clear Yeh, What Else?
I'm the reason that your ear rings is square Yeh, hear?
Now we take trips to casinos, to lovely homes
You check on Lotti's mom, Minos, Honeycombs Homes
You trying to fake it with cardem, pardon
You gonna leave them naked like Tarzan

[Cam'ron Talking]
Kudo Love know that too.

Holler at Kudo, ask Nelly about him.

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron 3rd verse]
Yo, Yo
I kill diamonds, get with pearls
I ain't trying kid the world
I ain't got beef, when I do, I say Get 'Em Girls
Not a diss dawg nope we just heard the fronting Heard It
Do Harlem a favor What? get a church or something something
A rec center in the winter where the youth can play
They don't even shoot the jay
sell drugs, shoot and spray
I'm knownbetter, still moving deuce a day
Two, that's two keys, I still move the Yay Yayo
Found a newer way
My crew do and say
Fist Fights to Shoot Outs, we won't move away
