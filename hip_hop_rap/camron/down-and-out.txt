Uh Killa
Baby

Yeah let's speed it up Ya'll hear people talking bout who high who not
Uh I'm back in Man they don't know we fixing to kill the game this year
Killa, Ye, come on

[Cam'Ron]
Uh uh aiyyo street mergers I legislated
The nerve I never hated
On murders pre-meditated
Absurd I hesitated
Observe cock and spray
Hit you from a block away
Drinking Sake on a Suzuki, we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer stupid stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace take ya girl fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking
Kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the chicks who really thought I wasn't from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
I feel like Bill Cosby pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard tangled grammar
Interior inferior star-spangled banner
Car game bananas
Ma man and Tana
Guns everywhere like the car came with hammers
He's back

[Hook - Kanye West Syleena Johnson]
They trying to say he down, down
I hear niggaz saying he down and out
But our flow's the truest oh
The game's in a nuisance no no
Our girls is the models oh
They coochies the juiciest ooooh
Yeah they say he down, down
Yeah they say he down and out
Cause I'm back on my grind oh
Money back on my mind no no
Ye and Killa Cam oh
The world is mine ooooh

[Cam'Ron]
I keep bitches straight up like +Simon Says+
Open vagina put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me And 1s hon lime and red
You got pets me too mines are dead
Doggy on fire minks gators that's necessary
Accessories my closet's pet cemetery
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo I run scandals with savages
All my niggaz get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what dog I'd rather shoot
I go to war old timbs batted boots
Hand grenade goggles and a parachute
Ya'll don't even know the name of my fleet
It was +Touch Me, Tease Me+ when +Case+ was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris
Ow

[Hook]

[Cam'Ron]
Yo aiyyo you dealing with some sure shit
My bitches pure thick
Play razor tag slice ya face bury
It's I who come by drive thru
Gator told Maury three quarters sky blue
Look at mami eyes blue five two
I approached her "hi boo, how you?"
Tony skin Louis oh you fly too
You a stewardess good ma I fly too
Now a nigga got baking to bey
Harlem shake naw I'm in Harlem shaking away
Shaking to bake, shaking to Jake's
Kill you shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Kiss ya picture though you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed you dough I had to load the fo
I hoped a nigga heard when I said I told you so
Uh Killa

[Hook]

[Cam'Ron talking]
