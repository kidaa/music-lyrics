Females better twirl off yours, better curl off yours
Cause i swirl off shores then what come back to a pearl golf course who you
I'm parock, cause girls are hoars, and the world is yours, Honey sip sizzurp hurl of course
And you know I'm in the buildin mister, wit the olsen twins, or the hilton sisters
And i haul em in to the hiltons mister
I milked them, i killed them, you quilt them, you missed her missed her
You helped her, you kissed her
You felt all the blisters, melt on your whiskers

[Chorus 2x]
