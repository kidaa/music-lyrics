Cam'Ron 
I'm not going to watch this go on any longer 
You put my food in the dark 
and expect me to look for my plate on some Mr. Magoo shit 
Fuck I look like 
I'm not going to watch this go on any longer 
WHOOOOOOOOOOOO 

Clue 
we going to set this off 

Cam 
I'm on ya'll 
Harlem, who else is going to hold us down 
Bloodshed niggas 
lets get it right this time 
understand 
Killer

Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daqueri's 
Like it's all good down at the hit factory 
Be on 54th, whole clique backing me 
all that click clackery takes your wrist wrappery 
I ain't no rapper, b, I skeet oozies 
And I can't act, turned down 3 movies 
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash 
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast 
My rude ass, carries 3 weapons 
And I'll give your face a c-section and keep stepping 
Who else in a hurry to mirk 
We kill girls, rape em', bury their skirts 
imagine me wake up 7:30 for work what?! 
I'd rather run the streets 7:30 with work 
But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order 
Came and asked me stop pitching to his daughter 
Tell me it's the man, can't be 
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties 
Got her damn handy 
How you going to ever ask stop carrying candy 
I'm going to sell to anybody in your damn family 
Your Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy 
Your right hand man Randy, understand me 
in Antlanta I got an outlandish land piece and a matching land 
Desert Calasandi 

Chorus: 

You know the one with the whips, THATS ME 
The one with the chips and the chips, THATS ME 
The one with the toast, pants saggy, yelling out get at me 
Get at me, nigga, THATS ME 
The one that be running and dodging, YOU 
The one that be sucking mad dick, YOU 
The one that's scared of some yay yo, 
always wanna lay low, cause your girl say so, YOU, biatch 

Cam 
I could show you some ice 
Throw you a bite 
You not that good dog, who told you you're nice 
Ay, yo your crew, switch siders 
When I come through, hey Cam 
Dick riders 
But I only mess with Navigators 528 
6 drivers, big buyers, where you live we live liver 
Come through, stick your suppliers 
Mack so many hoes, dick in siliva 
Gash her up, ma, put it on you mouth 
Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out 
And I don't got beef, I don't play those games 
If I did though believe me I would say y'all names 
Go to your house, red dot scope your crib 
Smack your earth, snatch your seeds, choke your wiz 
My crew split it was my mistake 
But to my nigga Duke we all make mistakes 
I'm going to get shit right if I spend my cake 
Jimmy, I'm a get you up out of 5h 
This is for my niggas that load the pipe 
Saying I'm the best just not promoted right 
You know my life 
Drink, smoke, roll some dice 
Control the hiest 
Know I'm a patrol your schiest 
We all get schiest 
Ma, keep all your rice 
Wedding ring, HELL NO 
I like all my ice 
Niggas tried to make Killa Cam all polite 
Turn on the set now bitch I'm like poltergiest 
You the type talk about everything you got now 
I interupt you like "Not now you hot owl" 
My rings like a dog, all rock wild 
When I flash it, everybody shocked "wow!" 
I see y'all concerned about me 
you don't got to go to school to learn about me 

Chorus:

Yo, the one with mad guns, THATS ME 
The one with the yay for 23, THATS ME 
The one with the ice, sliced, coke half price, 
yoke that's nice, THATS ME 
The one that's scared of a scuffle, YOU 
The one that say "Baby girl, I love you," YOU 
The one that talk about hustling, never seen a oven, 
you all about nothing, YOU Biatch 

Cam 
Told you I got us this time around niggas 
Feeling me some, HUH 
Harlem, I got us nigga 
Santana, Freaky Zeeky, Jim Jones 
Feshon, run with us or run from us or get run the fuck over 
It's fuck us so fuck y'all 

Killa bitch
