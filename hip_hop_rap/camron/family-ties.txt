Man I spit that pimp talk you hang out where the pimps collide it's a pimp in my ride, no need
To pimp the ride this ain't the pimp camp, pimp limp, pimp stance pimp slap a slim tramp order
Steak shrimp scamp. ok-k-kay you g-g-gay I souflet' ya toupet and bottles be a bouquet right

[Chorus - Nicole Wray:]
We in the zone our soldiers like to stand by, never alone we 'bout to make the Jones'cry "dipset
Dipset dipset dipset dipset dipset" we hold our own I think you get move us or push us we step
To the side that's why they call us "family ties" "dipset dipset dipset dipset dipset dipset"

From the back of the cop-ride to black on black black when we cop rides I will not hide hi mom
Hot dodge dick on her nose now she's cock-eyed from whippin' the bake-in-rolls to outside
Whippin' the bacon rolls sanai lathan nose I'm rakein' but makin' doe 80 holes in ya' shirt there
