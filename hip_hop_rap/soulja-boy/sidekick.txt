Talkin To This Shawty Up Inside The Club
Said A Couple Words And She Gave Me A Hug
Pulled Out The Sidekick 3 Is On Deck
So Much Ice Hanging Off My Neck
Back To The Topic So I Flip The Phone
Stacks On Deck Don't Get Me Wrong
Told Her This The New White D-Wade Wit The Suede
600 How Much I Paid...

[Chorus:]
For My Sidekick, For My Sidekick, For My Sidekick, For My Sidekick, For My Sidekick
For My Sidekick, For My Sidekick, For My Sidekick
Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, Hit Me Up On My Sidekick,
Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, 
Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, Hit Me Up On My Sidekick, Hit Me Up On My 

Lookin So Fresh As My Neck Is Bling
While I'm Textin These Gurls On My Sidekick 3
Some Call It 2-Way, Some Call It Sidekick
All I Know Is I'm Gonna Put It Down It My Kick
All White T-Shirt Wit The Phone Message
And When It Flip It Real Fast It Make The Gurls Look At It
I Ain't Gotta Say Nuthin But Man Am I On It
650 Dollars Just To Talkin On My Phone

[Chorus]

You Can Hit Me Up On 2-Way, My Sidekick 3 Its The Same Thing
If You Got This Phone Then U Ballin No You Ain't
Flipped Out That Junk And Start Callin Bet
Its Ya Folk Soulja Boy Man U Already Know
I Got Stacks On Deck When I Walk Through The Do'
Man I Can't Believe That I'm Rappin 'bout A Phone
But What U Won't Believe Is I Wrote This Song....

[Chorus]
