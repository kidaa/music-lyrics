Stop Snap Then Wiggle Wit It Snap
Stop Snap Then Wiggle Wit It Snap
Stop Snap Then Wiggle Wit It Snap
Stop Snap Cuz Soulja Boy Told Ya

[X8]
Do The Motorcycle Snap

[Verse 1:]
Posted At Tha Store Me And My Folk
Buddy Talkin Crazy But He Jus Dont Kno
Gipp In The Building And We Screamin Out We Up
They Aint Got No Money Sh** Gettem Outta Her
First Side Hype Im On Top Of The Charts
Charts Hit The Finish Line For A Playa In The Start
Still On The Scene Still Holdin Green
And Ya Kno We Can Meet If Ya Boi Disagree

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I Got Eyes In The Streets So I Kno Who Be Talkin
Half Of The Nights Soulja Boi Sleep Walkin
Patrone But Im Grown So I Stay On That Ex
I Stay Wit A Black Fitted Cap On My Head
Im Always Ridin Always Surprisin
Summer Time Hit And Im Goin To That Island
Im Jus Grindin Its Me Bein Me
Dont Get Served But U Heard In The Streets

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I Got Money On My Mind
Mind On My Money
I See Them Laughin But It Aint Nuttin Funny
Im Gettin Out The Work Tryna Stash 6 0
They Kno Who I B Cuz My Name On My Clothes
Hat To The Back Already On My Stand
Soulja Boy Gon Do The Dance
First Ya Snap Then Wiggle Then Rock
Hit The Motorcycle Then Stop
