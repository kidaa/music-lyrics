As I continue the journey to get your eardrums straight
Now pay attention to this flow, there's no reason to hate
Now watch me show your state, and let me state how I do it
Sit back and just listen to the music
You get sucked up in this melody
Hell'll be the ones that lay down and get caught up in their jealousy
huh They're telling white lies now realize I caught it from the top 
and I can see it in your eyes

You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool, you're the fool
You're the fool
F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
You whack bastard - and there ain't nothing you can do
F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do
You whack bastard - nothing you can do

Like a phony acting like that you was my homey
Like genuine you tried to ride me like a pony
I'm the only that's gonna shine, so forget it
You critics who wasn't with it 
Mad cause I flipped it back on ya'
Blowin up the spot like Kazinsky on safety
Blaze another track cause I'm simply hot to trot
Gotta make a knot, get the people into it
When I do it, grab the cash, and shake the spot
Now tell me if you know how I'm coming, nose running
To get a glimpse at the most stunning and cunning
And never will I change a format and now you know
I can't go for that

You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool, you're the fool
F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
You whack bastard - and there ain't nothing you can do
Fuck you - there ain't nothing you can do
You whack bastard - nothing you can do

F_ck that bullsh_t...you f_cking...that sh_t sucks... you weak bastard...
f_ck Vanilla Ice...He sucks...he eats sh_t...F_ck Vanilla Ice

yellingI hope you got more sh_t than that you weak motherf_cker!

And there ain't nothing you can do
And there ain't nothing you can do

One short life and I can't die
Some got more pricks than a motherf_ckin porcupine 
Still I'm waiting, waiting to die
Cause I burn like your mother says, boil like your father's pride

You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool, you're the fool
You're the fool
F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
You whack bastard - and there ain't nothing you can do
F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do
You whack bastard - nothing you can do
F_ck you...you white a**...Bullsh_t...corn-fed trailer park...bi_ch...
f_cking...F_ck you...cheap, worn out...yuppie...bastard...whack a**...
Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Biaaaatch!
