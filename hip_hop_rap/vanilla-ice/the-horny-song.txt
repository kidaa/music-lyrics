now that ya feelin it I see you're getting weak
you're gettin real close 
you're reachin that peak
uh  
you're like high altitude in a lear jet
work them hips like a pistons in a corvette   
slow down or I'll have to pull ya over 
search ya, handcuff ya, and do a move on ya
you get a GWB stands for girl with a body pump it like a hottie  
seems like you got switches and you're hittin em
two wheel motion keep bumpin em
now throw it east to west and put a hump in it
back stroke, and boogie with a bump in it
tell me how ya do it like that, how ya got stacked
how you scrambled like a quarter back
I want you weak in the knees and shaking in your pants
and all I wanna do is make you dance
come on!

Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come   Here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come   Here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come

see the sweat that you're lettin off
now, keep it comin girl 
ya know I love it when you take it off
you got me sittin in the hot seat 
drippin from the body heat 
from my head to my feet
we can do it by candle light all night
keep it goin till the sunlight,  that's right
whatcha tryin to do, make the Ice melt
don't you know my cream is good for your health 
you know you wanna shake what your mamma gave ya
you're getting real hot, now I'm gonna spray ya
rub it in like lotion 
juices flowin everywhere 
like water in the ocean
you got that hourglass figure 
uh 
all the right moves 
and ya know I wannaa dig ya
got 31 flavors, know what I mean 
and I wanna take a dip in your ice cream

Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come

know I'll be the one to kick this shit off 
and crank it up like a 250
engine in a motorcross
and make ya feel it girl 
till ya get sick with it
and all that junk in your trunk 
don't be stingy with it
and I'm gonna make it all good like the weekend
you got enough for yourself and for all my friends
and it's enough of me to go round like the globe
set it up like a tent, watch it unfold
I see your eyes glistening for the benji's
but you ain't gotta fake it 
I just want you to shake it
break me off a piece of that action like Jackson
I ain't trying to hit it 
and I ain't trying to wax it
picture you and me on the beach and you be 
climbing up this tall coconut tree
all I wanna do is hump with it and make you scream
and eat you up
as I floss with your g-string

Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come  Here I come, here I come
