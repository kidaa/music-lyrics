Geah
In the house
Come on
In the muthafuckin house
In the muthafuckin house
The VIII Hype thugs
Geah
Geah
Stick em
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
[ VERSE 1 ]
Call it what you want, but I need some ends some ends
Cause without no ends, you gots no fuckin friends no friends
Tired of pacin the damn flo' in wholly sweat socks
Graduated from the fuckin school of hard knocks
Moms used to kick me down with some loose change
First summer when I start tryin to gangbang
Everythang I was sportin was the color blue
Geah Gave a mad fuck who I threw it up to come on
Dip through, and you gon' get put on yo back
159 gees strapped with Macs that's right
Now let me down this St. Ides, cause it's all good
Another experience when you're growin up in the hood
I'm givin a fuck about school, a damn about moms
Droppin plenty of bombs while passin car alarms that's right
I got this glock cocked ready, and I'ma shoot it
Ready and I'ma shoot it Ain't nuthin to it
Come on
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
But to do it
But to do it
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
[ VERSE 2 ]
Moms kicked me out at the age of 15
Cause she ain't havin this ah-ah, her son a street pharmacist
Had them clucks hoppin faster than jumpin jacks
1st and 15th tryin to get off them 50 packs wassup?!
Hop my spot on the corner, ";What you need?";
Got my fuckin clientele, yes indeed yes indeed
I play it off like I'm in school, at the bus stop
Slingin this muthafuckin cavy to your moms and pops
I stacks my chips and dips
All around the neighborhood flossin, hoodrats I'm tossin
The park rolls too tough
Not givin a fuck about 'don't do drugs' and that dog McGruff
Ha-ha My 50s turn to c's
And pretty soon my c's turn to big-ass ki's come on, ugh
Geah, baby, you know how we do it
That's right ain't nuthin to it
Somebody say
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
But to do it
But to do it
I said
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
Who in the house?
VIII Hype in the house
That's right, come on
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
But to do it
But to do it
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
[ VERSE 3 ]
We go out for the dollar bill bill
Niggas that kill kill, tryin to be loc like Sugarhill
Our shit's on tight, better yet late night hype
Keep your shit on cool before you say goodnight
For good geah
Ain't no fuckin with the notorious hood
Ain't never hesitant
To clock them fuckin dead presidents
We got connections from east to the westside
Illegal runners who drops in a g ride run, run, run
Packs and stacks of fat grips
Nationwide service as we as we send em little bitches on trips
That's right Ain't a damn thing funny ah-ah
Like I say again, it's all for the money it's all for the money
So listen how the ego's strive
Ain't no Dolly Parton, fuck workin 9 to 5
Workin ain't nuthin to it
Geah, fool but to do it
Geah
And that's how it's goin down in the 9 to the 6
With a bag of tricks for that bitch-ass
Geah, uknowmsayin?
So take a journey to the Hub, uknowmsayin?
And you'll experience a new thang
Dealin with the Hub City players, uknowmsayin
The Westside, uknowmsayin?
Give it up for prices that niggas just got to fuck wiht
Tryina get it, uknowmsayin, that pro shit
VIII Hype thugsters in the house
Somebody take me out
Geah
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
But to do it
But to do it
Ain't nuthin to it
But to do it
But to do it
But to do it
You wanna make money? 
Nuthin to it, nuthin to it, nuthin to it
Play on your honey?
Nuthin to it, nuthin to it, nuthin to it
Smoke some bud'?
Nuthin to it, nuthin to it, nuthin to it
Be a VIII Hype thug...
Shit, that's kinda hard to do, big baby
