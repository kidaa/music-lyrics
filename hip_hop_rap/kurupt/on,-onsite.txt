feat. Lil 1/2 Dead

[Intro-Kurupt]
Dat Nigga Daz Dillinger
Kurupt, Young Gotti, nigga
West Coast California livin nigga

[Verse 1-Kurupt]
Milli monotone, cyclone Stallone
Marone chaperone shiny chrome Capone
Smashin in a 80 two brand new grown
Home sweet home nigga where the hoodstas roam
In gangstaville where we shoot to kill
Pop the pill, pop then drop the three-wheel
The tale of tales, fly high as a gazelle
The hell-hound came through and drown the whale
Pronounce, denounce, stripped in set sail
Soak in a could of smoke then inhale
Hold it in neva exhale
Smoke whoever nigga's zone I'm in, oh well
Fuck you and ya mama
Drama, holocaust through anaconda

[Chorus 1-Kurupt]
Nigga, I'm blastin on you, you
Your homeboy your whole hood
Fuck ya'll punk bitch made niggaz
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggaz

[Chorus 2-Lil 1/2 Dead]
Niggaz act like they gon' get wit me when they see me onsite
But I don't give a shit you bitch cuz I'm a gangsta for life

[Verse 2-Kurupt]
It's time to prepare, lil' nigga listen here
Get pairs like ten spears, your shit is his
Fist, five and five, and multitudes
Comin through bangin the five
Shit hit ligaments construct when we ride
I'm tired of all y'all rap is sawed off
Let off a belly, the Desert Eagle start yellin
Screamin, the path of a demon bellin
My all blue chucks all goin out right
Dippin through the back cuz it's on onsite
The first nigga saw is the first nigga gone
Smashed on, genked and shanked and blast on him
If the bitches strip, we out six, foe's
Like e'erday, Californ-I-A
I can't explain it, the immaculate can't be painted
Double-four's dump it on my lap for comfort

[Chorus 1-Kurupt]
For you, you
Your homeboy your whole hood
Fuck ya'll punk bitch made niggaz
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggaz

[Chorus 2-Lil 1/2 Dead]
Niggaz act like they gon' get wit me when they see me onsite
But I don't give a shit you bitch cuz I'm a gangsta for life

[Verse 3-Kurupt]
Prepare to storm, when the storm rain fire and brimstone
Spread throughout the plains like a plague
Back to the G's and fools
With the heater cocked, drownin niggaz in they own pool
Hit 'em hard like weights
Make a nigga feel it like pains and aches
Pump ya sip full and make ya spray and shake
I'ma git ya hit ya nigga makes no mistakes
I'ma crack the plate
I ride like dirt bikes, poetical ninja
I injure, pop mics forty-fifth recite
The sytem's assistance to get up in this
Dogg Pound, California you can't fuck with this
Kurupt Young Gotti, Fred, Daz Dillinger
Two shots just a killa to the head

[Chorus 1-Kurupt]
Fuck you, you
Your homeboy your whole hood
Fuck ya'll punk bitch made niggaz
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggaz

Fuck ya'll-you, you
Your homeboy your whole hood
Fuck ya'll punk bitch made niggaz
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggaz

Fuck all you, you
Your homeboy your whole hood
Fuck ya'll punk bitch made niggaz
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggaz

Fuck ya'll-you, you
Your homeboy your whole hood
Fuck ya'll punk bitch made niggaz
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggaz

[Chorus 2-Lil 1/2 Dead]
Niggaz act like they gon' get wit me when they see me onsite
But I don't give a shit you bitch cuz I'm a gangsta for life
