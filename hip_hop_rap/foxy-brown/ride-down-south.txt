[Intro]
Let's get it hype, nigga 
Let's get it crump 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Eightball]
Pass me them Swisher Sweets, let's get it crump 
If a nigga disrespect me I'mma prove my shit and dump 
Blast ryhmes like I pump, turn your belly to jelly 
Veteran MC, I don't think you rookies is ready 
Three hundred and fifty pounds of pressure to deal wit 
I run with Suave, always packin' something to kill with 
Feel this bitch, when I get rich I'mma still hustle 
Go down in history, paper taller then Bill Russel 
Kilo flows, I got 'em hid in the basement 
Choppin boys up, on some puttin' it in they face shit 
Eight Ball, F-a-t M-a-c-k, known for layin' it down 
And doin' shit the playa way 
Callabo's of the dough ain't no secret 
Space-age pimpin' means I don't do free shit 
Time waits for no one, it ain't gon' wait for me 
Yours truly, signed Eightball and MJG

	All my money making bitches if you ride with me 
	I'mma pimp 'till I die and I'mma ride for free 

	Now where them real bitches at

	Where they at, where they at, where they at, huh? 

	And where my buck niggas at

	Where they at, where they at, where they at, come on 

[Foxy Brown] 
I ain't new to this 
Damn nice bitch that's true to this 
Money ain't never been a thing to me 
Always stack my dough, holla back uh 
Ass fat, thighs thick, titties perfect 
Inhale the cheese from here to Tel Aviv 
Y'all know it, shit I don't bluff 
And no dough? I dont fuck 'em 
Fuck I'mma fake for? 
Make mine's, I'mma take yours 
Cuz I'm no nigga like love b'fore 
Make bitch scream like, gimme some more 
If a nigga broke, what'd you fuck him for? 
Waste of time 
It's like we playette minds 
Dont stop, get it get it 
Bitches, take it from a real motherfuckin' pro 
Y'all get that dough, we don't trust these niggas 
They gon' pimp if you let them 
From NY to the dirty south 
And them bitches' dime tight 
I got my mind right 
And my ice got the shine right 
And if it don't blind bitches 
When them lights hit the wrist? 
You won't be sticking shit 
You be lickin' this 

Repeat 1 

[MJG]
I'm the pimp motherfucker, baby 
Ice cold, stories so high 
I pimp the whole village twice 
So tight fold crease right on the president's nose 
Pimp clothes, drinkin straight Henney'and Buckstrum 
Touch toed, hoes take a centerfold pose 
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those 
Pros, slam those 
Game tied tight like bows, we never close 
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four 
Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold 
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed 
Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl 
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old 
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go 
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros 
We're pushin' hoes 
Dicks get erect like poles, pay the toll 
MJG is in control 

Repeat 1 

[Juvenile]
Peep dis', you and them boys need to slow down 
Up in the morning in the court, it's 'bout to go down 
There's no remorse now, better expose rounds 
Them jackets be on the lose until the dope is found 
Juvenile's my name, bitch 
I represent it to the end, the same shit 
Niggers don't be wearin suits on theses blocks 
All you see is your boys and reeboks 
A thin hat to the back with a strap too 
Willin' to bust a nigga ass if he had to 
If you feel the same my nigger, you's a hot boy 
Blocka, blocka, blocka 
Better get up off the block, boy 
Call for the cops, boy your mommy or pops, boy 
Cash wasn't a million, never hit the spot boy 
You want props ha, you sold to the cops ha 
You in a cell block ha, cuz you too hot ha 

Repeat 1 

[MJG]
Where the real ones at? Be-atch... 
Oh, you know how we feel 
About all you 'wanna be' ass ghetto super stars 
Wanna be like 'me ass" niggas 
Tryin' to be like Foxy Brown bitches 
I give a fuck about your intermureal status, motha fucka 
You ain't nobody 
We been doing this, been doin' this shit 
We go way back with this baby 
Talkin' about this real shit on the mutha fuckin' microphone 
Pimps and hoes and gettin' money 
Tricks and hoes and fuckin' 
Mutha fuckin' clothes and shit ridin' vogues and shit 
Nigga riding on 20's and shit 
Nigga what chu got? 
Brand new-assed nigga 
You don't know nothin' about this game 
Come on 

Repeat 1 until fade
