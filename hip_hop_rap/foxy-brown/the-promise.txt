The Promise 
f/ Havoc 

[Foxy]  Uhh, uh-huh, Firm 
[Havoc] Infamous 
[Foxy]  The Brook-lyn, Q-B 

	*chorus*
[Foxy]  My mind is the drama, that got me lookin back 
[both]  constant 
[Foxy]  Some Don shit, Foxy, get ready to 
[both]  bomb shit 
[Foxy]  Blink a eye, missed the comment 
        The calmest, it's not a threat, it's a promise, yeah 

Verse One: Foxy Brown 

Who be the, mahogany, mami, the slanted eyes 
hold it down, Boogie Fox, you bitch niggaz strip 
You web niggaz dead on, get fucked and wet on 
Shitted on, I want a low, fuckin wit Don 
like Ronald, thirty inch, fortistrano 
Mill-ion, sophisticado, ill movado 
The Firm's baby girl, my fam be my whole world 
It figures, cause she'd die for them niggaz 
Doe or Die status, ma-ma be the baddest 
From Brook-lyn to Queensbrige, it's pure Havoc, Havoc 
We on a job, fuckin wit Mobb 
They had the drop on em, the slanted eyes peep the rocks on em 
He kinda jig, and he bubblin big 
Dig a hole holdin, so's watch his cash start foldin 
And bet though, twenty G craps wet though 
Nas you shoulda seen the nigga jet though 
Had it on blast, shoulda seen me shakin all of my ass 
Of course me, I threw the gas, thug nigga turnin real saucy 
Firm lay low I'ma play if you say so 
So stay close like I'm bout to twist babe bro 
I laid it down, went a couple of rounds, and tried to flaunt him 
I threw it on him, now he's right where I want him 

Verse Two: Havoc 

Got my mind in crooked ways 
Saturated up in Alize, you ain't a threat nigga 
So get big nigga baby girl crossin over send your soldiers 
Toucha fuck a rusher, this world is colder 
like a, day in December 25th Son I got gift 
from monkey, motherfuckers, that wanna rip 
Get your shit split, pushed back, grill that ass don't look back 
Respect this, like a Lexus repo man I took that 
Five cats to death dog, like shop I'm gonna set more 
handwritten obituaries vocal through my chords 
Lights out... just pull the nines out 
Let's find out, pointin shook ones, they pointin dimes out 
It ain't hard, straight up and down, you get your deck pulled 
My hand is full, of fake niggaz I position 
Expensive intuition fuck a rap competition 
Gat expo, get a grip and never let go 
The tet blows, the rapper Noyd said, "That ass is wet though" 
Triple P, paranoid plus petrol 
Scared to death, put the pedal to the metal 
Ghetto connections, Audi 4, take your section 
You only get once chance, ain't no second guessin 
We blessin, peepin your style, them never testin 
Lessons of life walk the night witcha weapon 

*chorus reversed, Havoc takes the main and Foxy joins in 
 starts with "Son it's the drama" instead* 

Verse Three: Foxy Brown 

Fox Boogs, whattup, they get the jack, what the fuck 
Lucked up, the thug nigga took a L nigga bitched up 
The snake niggaz slither like Jake, ain't all great 
Ain't no threat Dunn, fuckin with them niggaz that's fake 
They got though, pushin a 850 auto, they sayin nada 
They know The Firm gettin nachoes 
Cheddar like whatever, I see money frontin in the Land 
I got him, I got me a fuck and his man 
Murderous mami, I threw the kiss, he was hist' 
Oooh, shoulda seen that ill Roley on his wrist 
It seem like he fuckin wit cream somethin mean 
You'll be straight with his eight, and dead him on all his heron 
Realistically, papi, is history, mami 
I got this, chill Pa Pa, let me rock this 
I'm fuckin wit fours to cock this, let me plot this 
ice he nuttin nice, if he front, take his life 
At the Shark Bar, fuckin wit Duke, him and his mans 
Really frontin boo, got him the red velour Filas too 
Here come my niggaz now in the black Hummer stuntin 
Yeah that's The Firm, jig the fuck up and body sumpin 
Whattup now Duke, his eyes cried from the inside 
I seen all of his fears cause he about to fry 
He looked at me, through his right eye, was like 
"Mami why?"  I felt fucked up, I can't lie 
He was shook, 'Mega opened his chest, ain't nuttin left 
but the sky blue Land, and that niggaz last breath 
Last breath... 

*chorus, Foxy alone all parts* repeat 2X 

Yeah, it's not a threat 
Uhh, Mobb Deep, Havoc, and Foxy 
Duo, uhh, sick to death baby 
Firm, Escobar 600, Sosa, Mega, Ice 
Grand Wiz where you at baby? 
Queensbridge, Don 'pu 
The whole Brook-lyn, pretty boy
