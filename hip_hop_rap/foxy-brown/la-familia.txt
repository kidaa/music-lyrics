The therough, the crime organized mad deniro 
And six point one five desero like hero'

Verse Two: Nature 

Peace and diagnosis, properly supply the dosage 
Leave them stuck like parol niggaz and breathes the focus 
Nigga when I squeeze ya pleads is hopeless, we wet though 
I jet from the block, niggaz can spot me like UFO's 
Dressed the low, jumped in the Q front for who? 
No need to stress it though, smokin' my dope countin' decimals 
Recognize this, real thugs respect violence 
The 1-9-9-6, some are rather dry snitch 
Coruptfully, my whole team recieve ???? to be 
Some are spare guns, shootin' fair ones in the public streets 
Believe the worst, so it seems the whole team is cursed 
We totured, drain the whole heat and squeeze first 
Never ending tales, when niggaz fall but some prevail 
They fake, callin' us together like four Navy war seals 
Must I start pullin' jooks or place my trust in God 
Force to cover my face, cameras held the case can solve 
Ya faith disolves when hump against the next coming 
For now I focus on Nature, bet I win something 

Verse Three: Nas Escobar 

I die for my niggaz, stick you for pies and lie for my niggaz 
Plead guilty and get the chair and fry for my niggaz 
It's essential that we all is there like ya mental 
We've been through life, cold blood living simple 
Though we learned from old dogs that made it, peeped who they played it 
We rated and then evaluated, calculated age is weepy 
The days that we see chips freely, beyond whips and TVs 
Stock bonds, Lou flipped the CDs 
Niggaz hate to see you on top, they'd rather be you what not 
I keep the dessert evil poncot, spot the Vickidees guy quick 
While poppin' shit that leave ya shot quicker than a hop skip 
Specialize in fly shit, bs on my breath while niggaz gossip 
On the tostic, I'm on some doe or die shit 

Verse Forus: Az the Vizuliza 

Check my lingo and all the white ice that make my rings glow

Face it it's mathematics, basics far from fake shit 
My mind is sacred, my spins shine like a cuban braclet 
Egyptian pharoah, roll the coke that used to give me powder 
Now I enhale from ???? buckshots through my double barrel 
Beneath the  town is how it's sounds travels, so what have you? 
Keep minds bests, never stopping until they grab you 
Used to bust shit down wit' test stocks and trust funds 
Cheese and CDs so my seed can so touch some, the foulness 
I once provoked is now behind me, it gonna take more than sellin' coke 
To now to bind me, you had me thinkin' I got to push leek 
To keep from sinking, that can out way life 
That keep live niggaz from linkin', I saw it coming 
That's why slowed down from from dumbin', most of my crew was runnin' 
Can't even afford a summons
