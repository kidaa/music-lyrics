Verse One: Foxy Brown 

Playa haters ery minute wanna stop my dough uh-huh 
And every other minute wanna rock my flow you know 
And every third minute, y'all wanna swerve in it 
Come quick like a virgin in it... aowwww! 
So far, came through this year with no bra 
Sheer shirt, shakin my Na Na, this head hurt 
Got em strung, let em know I'm like a Icee 
for the best effect you got to use your tongue 
Find my G-Spot get me hot I'm ill 
Foxy, chocolate baby, Got Milk? 
Shake that ass like you just don't care 
Cause y'all just rookies of the year, what? 
Work niggaz, like you one of the live niggaz 
Fly niggaz, known to handle a pie nigga 
Chick in the, off-white pearl six 
on the cellular, gettin them open like Girl 6 
It's on 

Chorus: Dru Hill with variations 

She's a bad mamma jamma 
Just as Foxy as can be as Foxy as can be 
Heyyy, she's a bad mamma jamma 
Just as Foxy as can be as Foxy as she can be 

Verse Two: Foxy Brown 

Player haters ery minute wanna see your clothes uh-huh 
Then every other minute wanna know what you drove uhhh 
Then every third minute, wanna know if the fur's rented 
That's why I got no time for hoes 
It's the Brown Fox, surround blocks, sound nice 
See me dressed, D-B-S, Brown rocks 
See me just, play the low pro 
Got these rap chicks in a chokehold, biotch! 
Basically, you're wastin your time hatin me 
I'm like one point five, got to make it three 
My name will forever ring 
Got em screamin "Damn Fox!" on erything, hell yeah

Master Tracks like Tone and Poke, and it's on 

Chorus

Verse Three: Foxy Brown 

Playa haters ery minute wanna shit on wax uh-huh 
Then every other minute talk behind your back uh-huh 
Then every third minute wanna rock you Venice and Bourbon 
Nah I ain't got time for dat... that's why 
I fakes no jacks, I got chips to gain 
I'm like Bo Jack baby, I'm hip to the game 
I know it well, rock Prada over Chanel 
A H-Class hoe with the H. Findel 
Rhyme deep in footwear, via Spiga 
Like Aaliyah, One in a Million 
There's MC's in this rap shit comin in illin 
like I did, laid the groundwork for five hits 
Member when I told y'all first week out 
Shipped a half a mil, niggaz freaked out 
Love yourself, put no one above thee 
Cause ain't nobody gon' fuck me like me, it's on
