La La La La La
It's the motherfucking B-R-O-W-N
Whoa
Slow your roll niggas
It's about to go down my niggas
I'm outta control still
Bubble slow and
Low in the rov and
Spit stick flow I'm a problem
Niggas
Y'all can't fuck with Boog

F-B the rap Angelina Jolie
Everything from Carty to Chloe
Posha here little Fifthmar there

It's not a game on the mic I'm insane
Snatch back my lane I'm a vince

Since the days of Kane numb 'em like cocaine

[Foxy Brown]
Still reppin the K gun in the waist
Hit by the Neptunes
Throw in that bass
Yeah y'all niggas got a problem
This year
I'm focused man holla from my blue and grey Pradas
Rov and 6-4 I'm the locest man
Hotter than dope man
I'm different dog I'm outta bitches reach
Y'all bitches take heed this bitch is deep
One lesson learned ain't nothing sweet
Body a broad I dont play with these broads
Y'all broads be killing me with that chatter
I go at one bitch the rest of y'all don't matter
Fuck around like y'all want it
With Brown
My knuckle game vicious
I'm shutting shit down niggas

Get gangsta girl
Gangsta
Gangsta Boogie nigga
Gangsta Boogie bitch

[Foxy Brown]
Since a little young broad
I been spitting this flame
Smack the shit out one y'all broads
Yall mention Fox name
Lord it's a shame I'm such ahead of this game
And you know she's a hot bitch
When they dirty your name
Give a bitch the 5 minutes of fame
Lot of broads ain't acting the same
Not that I knew 'em
But I passed them on a couple of corners
Racking that brain
and the 2 top bitches kinda slid off they game
And at the time I was going through my personal pain
Them the sorta things kinda drive you insane
Bitch betta thank God you slid in the game
Bout to kill bitches back
Man it's a wrap

Gangsta girl
Gangsta [4x]
