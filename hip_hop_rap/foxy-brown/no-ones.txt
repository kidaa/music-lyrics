No One's 

'Member Mossy, 'member the sweet dreams 
'Member the cocoa leaves, 'member Sega Gene-sis 
Now we live in love like Genovese, stash twenty G's ease 
Crib in Belize please, forever cheese 
Crib all fresh high-tech nigga, art deco 
In the villa room, sippin Demi Sec, ohh? 
Seperate the classiest from the nastiest 
bugs, on some ninety-six ill shit 
Niggaz used to rock Swatches and style 'member? 
Now they 'bezle on the Rolexes chips like December 
in Havana, the Cabana, Copa 
Now Fox is flippin more chips than Oprah 
Lizard skin sofa, ice flooded Don 
like Imelda Marcos, the Donness, I be the peron 
pure precon foot action Tone 
like the Brax-ton, Fox nigga get your smash on 

	*sung chorus* 
No one's gonna love you, the way I do 
Nobody, I can love you better 
No one's gonna love you, the way I do 
Nobody, baby your best bet is me 

It was the floss thang, for them niggaz to thug walk thang 
and for the chips, Reebokses and New York thang 
Small thang, and to the hottest, Goddess 
Caramel skin-tel, try this, and die the hardest 
Heartless, it was cool to shoot skully 
He's remind me, something like R. Kelly 
Back in the days, maxes and cresses 
Now it's 6's with chrome rellies, and BBSes 
Undress this, no deal, no skills off this 
and from where I was holdin, before this 
Bad chick before all this, peep the wrist action 
Fendi sell ices around the bezelle 
No sale, suited up in Bendel, Boogie 
Oh well, could tell, I floss well, uhh 
Peep the hustle, steamed shrimps and mussels 
Lampin, in the Hamptons, quarter mile from Russell's 

*chorus*

If we was all Don like DeMarco, runnin crazy 
niggaz, won't be haters, ballin, like briqueze 
Presedential suites at Ramada, in Nevada 
Cheese like Ricotta nigga, bet I'm droppin 
twenty G's on roulette, playa, what you bet? 
The Cris have a nigga trippin wet, uhhhh 
Seven figs on a bet, 84 be 48 
Five on the plate, high stake, indo 
Bet they went from Pujos to pushin Benz-o's 
Dippin on a van whip with the dipped Lorenzo's 
The sassiest, mahogany Brown 
Switch from, rockin lottoes to coppin movados 
Peep the mix like mulatto, feel on 
Tryin to chill on the ville sit back and get these mill-ions 
Yeah, now you ballin, please 
Your stash wasn't swollen till my dough started rollin 

*chorus*
