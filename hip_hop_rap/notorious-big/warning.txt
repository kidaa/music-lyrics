Who the fuck is this
pagin me at 5:46 in the mornin crack a dawnin
now I'm yawnin, wipe the cold out my eye
see who's this pagin me and why..
It's my man Pop from the barbershop
told me he was in the gamblin spot and heard the intricate plot
some people wanna stick you like fly paper neighbour
slow down love please chill drop the caper
remember them kidz from the hill up in Brownsville
that you rolled dice wit 
smoked the blunts and got nice wit
yeah my little Fame up in Prospect
nah dem my people nah love wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say dem, 
you school be bout some niggas 
that you knew from back when,
when you was clockin minor figures
Now they heard you blowin up like nitro
know they wanna stick the knife 
through your windpipe slow..
so thank Fame for warnin me now I'm warnin you
you got the mac Biggie  
tell me what you wanna do...

[CHORUS]
Damn niggas wanna stick me for my papers

[VERSE 2]
They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus
wit the Texas license plate outta state
they heard about the pounds 
you got down in Georgetown
now they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
they even heard about the crib 
you bought your moms out in Florida 
the fifth corridor....
Call the coroner
there's gonna be alot of slow singin 
and flower bringin
if my burgular alarm starts ringin
whatcha think all the guns is for
all purpose war got the rottweilers by the door
and I feed em gun powder so they can devour
the criminals tryin to clock my decimals
DAMN..niggas wanna stick my for my C.R.E.A.M.
and the inner dream things aint always how it seems
it's the ones that smoke blunts witcha
see your picture, now they wanna 
grab they guns and come and getcha
Bethca Biggie won't slip
I got the....
so I can rip through the intricate 
put they bodies in a bad prediciment
where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck with what I had you with 
you motherfuckers betta duck
I leave stains on blood of what remains
Had to jack-it, he had a gun he should've packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
so I can reload and explode down ya rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
see 4 to ya door no beef no more 
feel the rush scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff the more dangerous
I dont give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you
Start runnin, nigga I bust my gun in
Hold on I hear somebody comin........
