[B.I.G. - Verse]
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang wit us,
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us notorious, thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us,
Ya'll niggas be scramblin gamblin, up in restaurants with mandolins and violins,
We just sittin here tryin to win, tryin' not to sin,
High off weed and lots of gin, so much smoke need oxygen,
Steadily countin' them benjamins, nigga you should to if u knew wut this game would do 2 u,
Bin in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I've bin through,
So called beef with u know who, fucked a few female stars or two,
Then a bluelight niggas knew like
Mike-shiiit not to be fuck wit. Muthafucka betta duck quick..cuzz me and my
Dogs love to buck shit, fuck the luck shit strictly aim

Quit da game. Spit yo' game, talk yo shit, grab yo gat, call your clicks,
Squeeze your clip and hit the right one

All them hoes l gotta like one
Our situation is a tight one
What u wanna do? fight or run?

[Twista]
Making money livin' marvelous, in god we trust,
Don't too many niggas wanna start wit us, got big guns in the cars wit us,
Bust at any muther fucka actin hard wit us,
Don't really wanna show u wut a G.I.B., I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P.,
When u hear the music it'll be by me, Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G.,
Brooklyn and K-town, when u checkin out the flow, u know its goin rain with persistence,
2 legends on the same track, 2 different plains of existence,
Lets get it crackin' I love to bust flows, hit it from the back cus I love to buck hoe,
Spit it for the city I love Chi-ca-go, cali-coes buck, I love to bust those,
You think you can spit on the mike like Biggie and flow just as steady as I, shit is real u know u love
Him, u ain't got "Ready to Die",
"Life After Death", give to 'em, however u wanna nigga,that a day after, give it to ya, however u wanna
Nigga, cus the shit is giddie, so I carry big heat, screamin' come and get me,
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz beat,
3 mils I love to make 1, all these cars I love to ride 1,
All these hoes I love to cut 1, a tribute to
BIG I love to bust 1,

[Bone Thugs N Harmony]
In the middle of it hammer, bring niggas more drama than they baby mama, nigga on my back ima bomb ya,
One man but attack like a pack of piranhas, like terracotta,
Niggas always ready for war, they don't really wanna see a nigga tho,
We can hit 'em, in a minute, then be finished with 'em
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sick-o flo
Here wit Swizz, Oh NO!, niggas in trouble,
Somebody better call po-po, its gonna be murder when I get to servin them burners YEAH,
And niggas ya'll heard of me, brick city killa, nigga word to me,
And i'm passed that like Bernie Magic, wit a jack that'll snatch that rep, and stack some, drag him,
Double on that back random, with the bullets stop brand him,
Feeling hard you can't harass him,
Put it up in your magic, catch the magnum flashing cannons, niggas ain't ready for this 1, cus im on a
Mission to get even better than believe it i'm heavily heated,
It's easy to see it, if you wanna see me let that be the reason.

[B.I.G. - Chorus]
