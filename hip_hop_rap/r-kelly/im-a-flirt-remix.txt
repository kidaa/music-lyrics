[Chorus: R. Kelly] 
i'm a, i'm a, i'm a, i'm a flirt 
Soon as i see her walk up in the club i'm a flirt 
Winkin eyes at me, when i roll up on them dubs i'm a flirt 
Sometimes when i'm with my chick on the low i'm a flirt 
And when she's wit her man lookin at me, damn right i'm a flirt 
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz i'm a flirt 
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz i'm a flirt 
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and u trust her 
Then don't bring her around me cuz i'm a flirt 

[Verse 1: R. Kelly] 
Now swear to tell the truth 
And the whole truth 
When it comes to hoes i be pimpin like i supposed to 
Rollin like i supposed to 
Shinin like i supposed to 
In the club, fuckin wit honeys like i supposed to 
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club 
Freakin all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club 
And wonderin why all these playas tryin to holla at her 
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga i'm gon holla at her 
A dog on the prowl when i'm walkin through the mall 
If i could man i probably would flirt wit all of y'all 
Yeah, yeah homie u say she yo girlfriend 
But when i step up to her i'ma be like, "cousin" 
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the chi 
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi 
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch 
Cuz hey i'm black, handsome, i sing plus i'm rich and i'm a flirt 

i'm a, i'm a, i'm a, i'm a

[T.I. Speaking:] 
Hey homie, if u ain't gettin no money 
U better keep her away from me ya dig. 

[Verse 2: T.I.] 
Well if u love ya girl 
And wanna keep ya girl 
Don't be walkin up and askin me to meet ya girl 
Because i'm well enough a flirt when i speak to girl 
She winked her eyes on the slide

Better treat your girl right 
Cuz another man will 
Better eat ya girl like another man will 
Cuz u leave your wife

I can even make her mine 
If i hit that price

Up on that dresser

Pullin on her hair 
Like we gettin in a fight

But it'll suit 'er just right 
So if yo girl sexy 
And she test me 
Don't be upset g 
Cuz u might catch me 
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt 
The mclaren in reverse 
Then if i see her and i like her then i'm a flirt
