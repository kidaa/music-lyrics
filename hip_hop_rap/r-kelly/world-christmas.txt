Hearing the bells go ding - dong 
Hearing the choirs sing songs 
Letting us know its Christmas
time for the world to spread love. 

I open my eyes 
and to my surprise 
I've come to realize that ... 

chorus 
All around the world is Christmas 3 x 
and I'm so glad to be 
sharing peace and harmony with you. 

Looking out of the window 
seeing the winter white snow. 
a kiss under the mistle toe 
I see the angels halo 

I open my eyes and to my surprise 
I've come to realize that... 

All around the world is christmas 3 x 
and i'm so glad to be 
sharing peace and harmony with you. 

bridge 
So come on, come on 
a child is born unto a sub king. 
so, joy to the world 
woman , man , boy , and girl 
for it is love that this christmas brings 

All around the world is christmas 3 x 
and I'm so glad to be 
sharing peace and harmony with you.
