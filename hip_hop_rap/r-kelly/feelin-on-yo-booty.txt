This is my song for real no doubt. Said the DJ's makin me feel thugged out. As I walk you to the dance floor, we begin to dance slow, put your arms around me,Im Feelin On You Booty. 

Verse 1: Hey pretty mama how you doin. Said Im just in town for the weekend. Lookin for a little trouble to get into. Baby tell me what your drinkin and I got'chu. Playa's wanna play, balla's wanna ball, rollers wanna roll. But Im takin' off after I dance.

Chorus2x

Verse 2: Now your bodys got me feelin like spendin. With a back room I could come to live in. And your hair weeves lookin kinda purty. The way you back it up on me baby, God Have Mercy. Playa's wanna play, balla's wanna ball, rollers wanna roll.But Im takin' off after I dance.

Chorus2x

Bridge: If its ya birthday,then put ya hands up. You wanna get drunk, then put ya hands up, and if you got some cash, put ya hands up. And your own job, put ya hands up,Playa's wanna play,balla's wanna ball, rollers wanna roll, feels so good say it again.Playa's wanna play, balla's wanna ball, rollers wanna roll.But Im takin' off after I dance.
