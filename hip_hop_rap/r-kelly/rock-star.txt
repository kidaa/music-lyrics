Stuntin in roberto Cavalli mami wit the dime frame
Hotter than tamales u probably should be my wild thing
Tell dem other chicks mind they own business n let us do our own thing

And i'll, i'll lick ya, i'll lick ya down, u taste like cinnamon
And ill, grab a lil bit of that whipped cream
Then i'll put her on her back get mean
Then i'll get her in the matrix, cut her lasik
Basically make her scream
At the top of her longs
Give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before i poke ya to death
Someone call in the ref
Ludacris is tired of playin
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that you got everybody sayin

Up until they close curtains
Then right after the show
Backstage ass hurtin
Call me scottie cause girl cause girl

Once I getch getcha
Gone come on up out of those D cups
Strokin it hard strokin it hard
While u got ya legs up
Making ya making ya sound like ya
Got the hiccups
What want because I'm about to give u what u need
Up in my room u screaming hercules hercules
Man get Kells & Luda on a track a hit is guaranteed
Everybody on they feet
This is what yall shirt should read
