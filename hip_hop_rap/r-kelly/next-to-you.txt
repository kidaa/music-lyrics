[Ciara:]
I hope I don't make you mad, with what I'm 'bout to say boy
Here we are once again, and I'm havin second thoughts boy
I'm not messin' with your head, but I changed my mind boy
I don't know why I'm here, the same time I want you near
If you want me to leave, I will understand
See I will just have to respect your wishes boy
'Cause if I stay ain't no tellin' what may happened boy
Although you look so good to me, it's best that I leave

[Chorus:]
I'm scared of being next to you, because of what I think I might do
Boy you're turnin' me on right now, I can't get down like that right now
I don't want to disturb the flow, but this is not my M.O.,
Hold up, wait a minute, we're movin' too fast
I want somethin' like this here to last.

[R. Kelly:]
Don't say no baby, not right now baby,
I want you to be my lady, you got me goin' crazy

[Ciara:]
Well I guess I'll stay for a minute, then I have to go boy
This moment is so temptin', right now it's not what I want boy
Maybe if we just embrace, with a simple kiss boy
But that'll only make things worse, hope I'm not gettin' on your nerves boy
I just wanted to be right for the both of us
You don't have to say a thing to make me comfortable
Boy, you make me so weak when you look at me
Right now I'm a little confused, I think it's best that I refuse

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Supposed to be playin' cards, or watchin' a movie
But we keep lockin' eyes boy, now why are you tryin' to tease me?
This room is gettin' heated, won't you open up a window?
I think that I should go now, 'cause I can't take this no more

[Chorus x3]
