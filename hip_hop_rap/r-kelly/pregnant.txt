Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Lay your body down and get you pregnant, 
Knock you up, pregnant, Knock you up 

Can you believe I'm in the club with a girl who has a man, 
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand, 
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates, 
To much like my patrone man I'm just tryna take it straight, 
Untill I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty, 
Sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that shes a cutie, 
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while, 
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child, 
Telling myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off, 
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog, 
Never felt nothing like this, 
Shes more than a mistress enough to handle my business, 
Now put that girl in my kitchen, 

Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
That's what I told her, 
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Lay your body down and get you pregnant, 
Like you are, 
Knock you up, pregnant, 

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me, 
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese, 
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasy, 
I can hide your co-star and get in one of my new wiis, 
Tell me what your name is, 
I can make you famous, 
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexing, 
Now I ain't got nothing to do tonight I gotta wait for my crew, 
I just wanna put some in you, 
And I can tell that you want it too, 
And I'm ready babe, 
And your ready babe, 
So let's go get out of this club, 
Kel's and Rys after party, 
You can fuck with us, 

Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Lay your body down and get you pregnant, 
Knock you up, pregnant.
