I can't think straight
Take a look, look at me
What you get is what you see
ride a bike drive a car
Vegan Pie cut a fart
on the bus on the train
Tami D on the brain
Can't explain like the who
now it's time to do the do
I can't think straight
On my couch with a pen
Where's the phone again again
Can't control rhythm rhyme
Naked beats on the mind
I am yes you are no
I am yes you are no
You are no I am yes
I can't think straight
