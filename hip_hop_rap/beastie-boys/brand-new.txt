Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you
Deep inside you will find
Something that you won't mind
Think about diamond rings and goldfronts combined
Then go back go way back
Something passed that you lack
Well I've got brand new
A scooby snack just for you
Brand new, it's brand new for you x4
Sabrosa
Brand new, it's brand new for you x4
Deal With It

Rob and Steal from the Health Food Store 
The ideas you shout that are so hardcore
Screaming at the phone man collecting the change 
Ideas discovered then rearranged
I won't say that life's a bitch and then you die 
Because I do my best to enjoy mine
You can't bring me down to a world of self pitty [sic] 
Lot's of ways to deal with it
Deal with it
You do unto others like they're pieces of shit 
A rightous [sic] man who's flipping the script 
There's plenty of room for everyone at the table 
Check yourself before you check the label 
I won't live life being mad holding a grudge 
It's not my place - sitting back playing judge 
Not enough time to always stay mad
May as well be glad to Deal With It
Deal With It
