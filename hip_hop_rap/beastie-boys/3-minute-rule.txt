I stay up all night go to sleep watching Dragnet
Never sleep alone because Jimmy's the magnet
I'm so rope they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise you know I'm the cool coper
On the mic I score just like the Yankees
Get over on Ms. Crabtree like my main man Spankee
Excuse me young lady I don't mean to trouble ya
But you're looking mighty fine inside your B.M.W.
I got lucky I brought home a kitten
Before I got busy I schlepped on my mitten
Can't get better odds 'cause I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary keeps on turning rolling like a Ring Ding
Jump the turnstile never pay the tool
Doo wa diddy bust with the pre-roll
Customs jail me over an herb seed
Don't rat on your boy over some rat weed

Not perfect grammar always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D. is for diamonds

Out of your back door and into another
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
Roses are red the sky is blue
I got my barrel at your neck so what the fuck you gonna do
It's just two wheels and me the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
'Cause you know why a you see H.
I'm takin' all M.C.'s out of the place
Takin' life as it comes no fool am I I'm goin' off gettin' paid and I don't ask why
Playin' beats on my box makin' music for the many
Know alota funky girls who like to do their thing
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan
I smoke cheeba it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
People come up to me and they try to talk shit man
I've been making records since you were sucking on your mother's limp dick

Girl you're walking tall now with your fancy clothes
You got fancy things going up your nose
You get fancy gifts from expensive men
You're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection getting girl's affection
If your life needs correction don't follow my direction
You got your 8 by 10 your agent your Harley
You be driving around Hollywood yes sorry charlie
'Cause I'm running things like some Mack motherfucker
Your only claim to fame is you're a false fake sucker
You slip you slack you clock me you lack
While I'm reading on the road by my man Jack Kerouac
My veins are like vines
Filled with red wine
Poetry in motion coconut lotion
I had to diss the girl because she got too emotional
Are you experienced little girl
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
Give time for your mind it's hard to forget me
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out now, and keep peacing out
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
And I'm out
