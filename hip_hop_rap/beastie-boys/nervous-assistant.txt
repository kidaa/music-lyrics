Opens the door Mics the drums
Nervous Assistant here he comes
Too much coffee out of control
When he rides he rides the poll
White build up crazy twitch
Always in a rush to hit that switch
Nervous Assistant
You wanna something you wanna something
You wanna something - my dick
Running around nothing found moving too damn quick 
You know where to find me anytime
I can't take it I've lost my mind
Proud to say no I'm not son
I I I I got one
Nervous Assistant
Too much action right by me
Like Buddy Rich try me
Need a brain that's stress resistant
Or else I'll be .... the Nervous Assistant
