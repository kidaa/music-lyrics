Get on the mic
Mike let's be real and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are rope an M.C. you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to
You say fuck that I say fuck this
The king Ad-Whammy has never been limp Dick Butkus
One half science and the other half soul
His name's Mike D. not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
M.C. Busy Le Disco fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girl'cause you know she never says no
Get on the mic

Well Mike D. is a special individual
Pulling out knots pulling in residuals
Go to the movies get the Rolos the cholos riding slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo
Mike my stromy don't be so selfish
Get on the mic'cause you know you eat shellfish
