I give to this world 'till I've got nothing to give to
I give thanks to this world for the life that I've lived through
Stress gets in the way of the shit that we're doing
We'll bum rush the door if you don't let the whole crew in
I want some
Give me the chance and I will show you what I'm feeling
My mind's caught up in the Shit the man's dealing
looking Ahead the next level we're gonna take it to
I guess I should be happy it's a day that we made it through
I want some
