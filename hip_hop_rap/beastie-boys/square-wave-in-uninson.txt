Made a noise invented a sound
When Brian Wilson used it A hit was found 
If only I could have imagined
The square waves running through his head 
Square wave - people couldn't believe it 
Square wave - all the way to Carnegie hall Square wave
One rod for Pitch
Electro Magnetic Fields
Wired up Sing Sing
hung out with Einstein
For all All of his brilliant innovation
Sent off to a siberian reservation
Square wave - people couldn't believe it 
Square wave - all the way to Carnegie hall Square wave
