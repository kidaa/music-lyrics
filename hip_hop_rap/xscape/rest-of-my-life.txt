Hoo...ooh...oh...oh...
Hoo...ooh...oh...oh...
Hmm...oh...

Suddenly, it happened so fast
I couldn't believe the news that I received
My heart stopped as I hit the floor
I fell to my knees cryin', "Lord, help me"

No matter what times brings
Or the changes we go through
In life there's some things
We just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
Gonna love you for the rest of my life

Don't they know
True love never dies
I promise to love you
For the rest of my life

Life goes on, that's what they say
Time will heal all your pain away
But I feel, feel so alone and
Now you're gone, how can I live on

No matter what times brings
Or the changes we go through
In life there's some things
That we just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do What they do
I don't care what they think Some times I love you
Gonna love you for the rest of my life Yeah

Don't they know True love
True love never dies It never, never, never, never
dies
I promise to love you Gonna love you, gonna love you
For the rest of my life For the rest of my life, ooh

Until I see you again
I'll hold on to sweet memories, yeah
I'll treasure the times we spent
I see your eyes, you realize
I see your face, I see your smile
Callin' out my name

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do What they do
I don't care what they think I'm gonna love you, I'm
gonna love you
Gonna love you for the rest of my life For the rest
of my life

Don't they know True love
True love never dies Never dies, no
I promise to love you Gonna love you
For the rest of my life For the rest of my life

To love you for the rest of my life
