[Verse One LaTocha:]
Boy, I can't wait to get you alone,
Inside my house.
'Cause baby it's you and only you,
That I keep on thinking about.
I know that you want it,
How good my love could be.
Tonight you will get the answer,
I'll satisfy your curiosity.

[Bridge:]
[Tamika]
Take me away in ecstasy,
I want to know how it feels to be loved.
Boy take your time because I have all night,
I'm gonna show you how it feels to be loved.

[Chorus:]
I've got love on my mind,
I knew it's the way to make things right,
I think it's about that time.
I got love on my mind,
I'm in the mood to be moved,
And do all the things you want me to.

[Verse Two LaTocha:]
I've been watching you,
And thinking to myself.
You're looking so so def to me,
And I'm feeling so sexy.
You know I never felt this way before,
I really can't help myself,
'Cause I'm thinking of nothing else.

[Repeat Bridge and Chorus x2]
