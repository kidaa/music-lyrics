[Intro Tamika:]
This ain't your ordinary sh**,
This ain't the sh** that your used to,
This ain't your ordinary sh**,
Do you want to - remix.

[Verse One LaTocha:]
Oh baby it's Friday, no one is home but me,
I think of your body, I wanna get freaky.
I wanna do everything you like,
I'm gonna make you feel alright,
I've got plans for turning you out tonight.

[Chorus:]
Do you want to, baby,
Do you want to, say you do.
Do you want to, baby,
Do you want to, say you do.

Rap by King Just:
Oh baby what you got,
'Cause I want the lot,
Just thinkin' about you is making me hot,
Rubbing my right spot,
Touching my private parts, sweetheart,
I knew we'd get it on from the start.
It's the things you do,
So I xscaped from the zoo,
Do I want to,
That's not even a question boo.
I wanna get it on to the break of dawn,
It's the horniest man alive,
Better than the don.
No flows on the radio,
'Cause I leave you out of breath,
It's BlackFist, here with So So Def.
Rock all the time out,
'Cause I'm spitting rhymes out my mouth,
From up north to down south.
Kick off your shoes relax your feet,
And party on down with the K-I-N-G.
Just still flippin' it,
Just still rippin' it,
I run with your crew ever since "Just Kickin' It".

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Two Kandi & Tiny:]
Do you see the twitch in my eye,
Saying baby come and get it,
In my bed I lie,
Waiting, hoping that you're with it.
I want you, and I hope that you are ready,
'Cause I've got plans of doing thangs to you.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Outro Tamika:]
This ain't your ordinary sh**,
This ain't the sh** that you're used to.
This ain't your ordinary sh**,
Do you want to - remix.
