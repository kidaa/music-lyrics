[Verse One LaTocha:]
Baby, don't worry 'bout what they say,
Maybe, you and I can do our own thing,
All I want is for you and I to get down.
Baby I know just what your thinking,
I've got what you need but can you handle it,
All night long, all I want,
Is for you and I to go dance.

[Chorus:]
Baby we can do it,
Lets dance all night.
Come on make your move
Let's party all night
All night long,
All I want is for us to get down

[Verse Two Tiny:]
Move on down to the dance floor,
The way you move you make me want you more,
All I want is for you and I to get down.
Just let the music take control of you,
Why don't we do what we came here to do,
All night long, all I want,
Is for us to get down, get down.

[Repeat Chorus x2]

We're gonna dance til the early morn',
We're gonna do what we came here for.
Move on down to the dance floor,
And get down, get down.
[Repeat x2]
