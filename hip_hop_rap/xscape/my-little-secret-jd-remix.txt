[Verse One Kandi:]
Step out my house, one in the morning,
Get in my car, go put it on him.
Park on the other side of the street so that,
Everybody in the hood won't know that.
It's me he's been coming to see,
And we do this every night of the week,
We don't have to talk to each other on the phone,
'Cause I know what's up when I hear my beep.

[Chorus:]
You're my secret,
And that's how we should keep it,
They think so,
And they wanna know,
But they don't really know.
You're my little secret,
And that's how we should keep it,
They think so,
And they wanna know,
But they don't really know about you and me baby.

[Verse Two Tiny:]
If we stop talking for a long time,
It'll be hard to get you off my mind.
'Cause I got feelings for you I can't hold back,
I want to but I can't show that.
It's me he keeps coming to see,
And we do this every night of the week,
We don't even talk to each other on the phone,
'Cause I know what's up when I hear my beep.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge LaTocha:]
I like to be in the room with you and your girlfriend,
The fact that she don't know turns me on.
And she'll never never guess in a million years,
That we've got this thing going on.

[Rap by Harlem World:]
Now from Harlem World to the ATL
I got chicks that'll make me yell, make me swell,
Make me tell all the things that I done,
So much playa hating gotta cling to my gun.
But son, it's not a game,
'Cause you ain't getting it,
Consider it instead of being inconsiderate,
I use every weapon I choose and get rid of it,
Illeterate cats only getting a little bit.
I play till the day I fall out,
Ball till the day a ball out,
Still feel the rush and brawl out,
Never push the whips and stall out,
People wanna know what it's all 'bout,
But So So and All Out,
Never win a small pour out,
Chicks watch our wrists while the Crys pour out,
I score 'bout two minutes before I soar out,
Got Lear jets and Coups looking like a poor house.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Break LaTocha:]
The love that we share stays on my mind,
You're always gonna be a little secret of mine.
The love that we share stays on my mind,
You're always gonna always, gonna be my little secret.

[Repeat Chorus]
