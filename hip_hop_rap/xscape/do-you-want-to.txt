[Intro Tiny:]
Hey baby, I wanna know one thing...
Do you want me as much as I want you
Say you do.

[Verse One:]
[Tiny]
Never should have kissed you, 
Never made that call.
I told myself, 
In love I shouldn't fall.
Would've been a pleasure,
Just to know your name.
Look at me, silly me,
Now I'm back in love again.
[LaTocha]
And there's nothing you can tell me,
Nothing I can do.
I just hope that you're in love with me,
The way that I'm in love with you.

[Chorus:]
Do you want to,
Like I want to be in love with you.
Say you do.
Do you want to,
Like I want, I want to make love to you.
Say you do.

[Verse Two:]
[Tiny]
Never understand it,
Loving takes control.
Oh, I ask myself,
Girl, should you let it go
That would be too crazy,
Life without you know.
Hate to think of it happening,
That you won't be around.
[LaTocha]
Now there's something you can show me,
Something you can say.
Promise me you'll stay with me,
Until my dying day.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Break:]
[Tiny]
Now my deep emotions
Have completely come over me.
I'm into you, I'm loving you too deep,
Oh, yes I am.
[LaTocha]
Should have seen it coming,
Felt my heart beating much too weak.
I can't control, I can't let go,
Of you baby, you baby, you.

[Repeat Chorus to fade]

[Outro:]
[Tiny]
Did it feel good to you, baby,
Like it felt good to me.
Do you want it again baby, baby,
'Cause I want it right now, yes I do.
[LaTocha]
Sometimes I cry, baby,
Sometimes I weep at night, baby.
Take me, take me, tell me you love me, baby,
Say you really, really love me, baby.
Sometimes I can't sleep at night,
'Cause I want you right here by my side.
Baby, baby, baby,
Say you want to make love to me, baby,
Like I do to you.
