[Verse One:]
Is my living in vain
Is my giving in vain
Is my singing in vain
Is my praying in vain

No, of course not.

[Bridge:]
It's not all in vain,
Because up the road is eternal gain.

[Verse Two:]
Am I wasting my time
Can the clock be rewind
Have I let my light shine
Have I made 99

[Chorus:]
No, of course not.
[Repeat x4]

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Bridge]
