[Intro:]
Hey big baby,
Girls grab your guys,
And guys grab your girls tight,
'Cuz everything's gonna be alright tonight.
Kindly put your hands together,
For the sensuous sounds of Xscape.
Lay back, kick it, and enjoy the ride.

[Verse One LaTocha:]
Now that the rain is falling,
Down on my window pane,
I'll make you feel so good,
And you'll be happy that you came.
We'll have some dinner,
And some candle light,
But first make love to me,
Until the morning light.

[Bridge Kandi:]
I know you've been waiting,
To get inside my world.
So boy let me show you,
That I can be a special kind of girl.
Baby don't you know,
That tonight is the night baby...

[Chorus:]
Tonight, tonight, oooh
Tonight, tonight, oooh

[Verse Two Tamika:]
Come on baby,
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
I think the time is right,
To give you all of my love.
Even though this love's a gamble,
It can be so right,
Make sure you're love is true,
Before you turn out the light.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Break Tiny:]
Because tonight I want to give you all of me,
So just take it slowly,
And make sweet love to me,
Give me your hand and let me lead the way,
Guiding your heart to ecstasy.
