[Verse One Kandi:]
When you're far from me, there's a melody,
That always brings me closer to you.
It's our own symphony, just for you and me,
And I hope they play it real soon.
Everytime I wish that we were dancing slow,
That's when I hear it playing on the radio,
I know...

[Chorus:]
This is one of those love songs,
That you hear in the middle of the night,
Makes me wanna be with you,
Wherever you are tonight.
And whoever's listening,
Just hold your lovers tight,
'Cause this is one of those love songs,
One of those love songs.

[Verse Two LaTocha:]
As days turn into years, we've had our share of tears,
But they never seem to last long.
'Cause the sadness disappears,
Every time I hear our favorite love song.
Now the candles burn as I lay here in my bed,
As the melody keeps playing over and over in my head.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Break Tamika:]
That you never want to end,
And you hope that the DJ plays it again and again and again,
Play it again and again and again.

[Repeat Chorus]
