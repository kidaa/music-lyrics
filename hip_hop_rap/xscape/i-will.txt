I will always love you...

[Verse One Kandi:]
You were the first to take my heart,
Make me happy, at the same time make me cry,
Show me a lot of things I never knew I had inside.
Late night phone conversations of you,
Telling me what you wanna do,
Then we argue all night about who's been sleeping with you.

[Bridge LaTocha:]
No matter what people say,
It don't change the way I feel.
And no matter how much we fuss and fight,
I got to keep it real with myself.
'Cause as bad as I wanna leave,
It's the hardest thing for me.
I can keep trying to act like I don't care,
But deep down inside I ain't going nowhere.

[Chorus:]
I will always love you,
No matter how many things you do or say,
Certain things just don't go away.
[Repeat x2]

[Verse Two Kandi:]
You were the first to see my body, body,
Give me gifts and all kinds of real nice things.
I used to tell you how much I loved you,
And in return you would do the same.
I've had so many lonely days,
Ever since you upped and went away.
I can't help but wonder where you're at,
Hoping one day you'll be back baby.

[Repeat Bridge and Chorus]

Respectfully I say to you I'm aware that you're cheating,
But no one, no one can make me feel the way you do.

[Repeat Chorus]
