[Intro:]
Shoop be doop
Shoop be doop doop dah
Shoop be doop
Love's a funny thing

[Verse One:]
[Tamika]
Was only last night I felt you slip away,
I tried so hard to hide the pain inside of me babe.
I held you close but you weren't with me,
I felt your mind a thousand miles away.
[Tiny]
I was a fool to let you break me down,
You think by now that I would know,
Just what to expect from you, oh.
Everytime I fall, I make myself believe,
That you are changing,
And some day, the sun will shine through.

[Chorus:]
Love is a funny thing,
Your love is a funny thing,
Love is a funny thing,
Oooh.

I don't wanna fall, don't wanna fall in love again

[Verse Two:]
[LaTocha]
When I first met you your heart was empty,
You were innocent and so full of joy.
But now you've changed and I don't know you,
You played me baby like a toy.
[Tiny]
You see, I was surprised to see you with that girl,
When you said you'd never ever ever ever see her again, no.
I don't want to control you, so baby if she's gonna hold you,
Then why don't you just stay, stay where you've been.

[Repeat Chorus]
I never never wanna fall again, no no no

[Bridge Kandi:]
Everybody needs someone to hold them through the night,
And everybody needs someone to tell them it's alright.
I gave you my heart and you only turned away,
So tell me baby, what's going to make you stay.

[Repeat Chorus]
I never ever want to fall in love again

Shoop be doop
Shoop be doop doop dah
Shoop be doop
Love's a funny thing
