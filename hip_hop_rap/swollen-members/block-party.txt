[Chorus]
Nuclear power, you can feel how were
Changing up the game, things wont be the same
After we done with it
Were hollering at you all, like come get it
Bump bump bump
Bump bump bump
All the girls say
Bump bump bump
Bump bump bump

When the roof come tumblin down
You know we the cause of that, Imma go down
In history as some kinda alien rhymer
Who blew up the planet then left in a space liner
And took all the bitches with him, and then hit em
My man Nucleus provided this dumb rhythm
Dumb meaning good, not dumb meaning stupid
You all dont believe it then you can come see me do it
My truth is my truth, thats all there is to it
I say what the fuck, I feel it, get used to it
Ah its an incredible game
I got love for my partners, we know were the same
Ooh sometimes Im wildin out
Set the building on fire then you fallin out
And then we can turn it into a block party
And get some drinks on while you call the cops on me

[Chorus]

I keep a ton of them runnin like mascara
Prev One numba one in the last era
Now thats terror you should call me the crypt keeper
Smokin green reefer with the grim reaper
Im the kind of rapper you should keep in your household
Turn up the heat because everything in my mouth cold
Im a ball of ice and rock
Hurling words at a speed thats unorthodox
Clashing worlds, Pandoras Box
Burning herb, twenty past four oclock
When my cell mates loose all hell breaks loose
Hit you from above and put some shells on your roof
Tell him to move, run through obstacles
Retrospect, laser opticals
Seven nation armies couldnt hold me back
When I swing a battle axe Imma make a skull crack

[Chorus]

Aint no holdin us back like crack addicts
Tell your whole camp to pack up, Im back at it
As a matter of fact Im strapped with raps of combat
Full combat, you dont want that
Ill put you in a headlock, twist your arm back
Rip up your throat back, snatch your change
Got a lotta great friends but I act so strange
I wonder if its anything to do with fame
I wonder how many of them would like to ruin my name
Careful what you wish for it might come true
Then every move I make youre like can I come too?
Then everyone I meets like how can I join you?
I aint pretendin that its not strenuous
My girlfriends jealous and my best friends envious
Stay focused, please remember this
Keep friends close show enemies what unfriendly is

Nuclear power, you can feel how were
Changing up the game, things wont be the same
After we done with it
Were hollering at you all, like come get it
Bump bump bump
Bump bump bump
All the girls say
Bump bump bump
Bump bump bump
Fellas go
Bump bump bump
Bump bump bump
Ladies go
Bump bump bump
Bump bump bump
