[Chorus x2]
Concentrate and think about the words these monsters say 
Moves that we make and the shit That we doing  
Soon youll find yourself under there influence

[Madchild]
Ok, Jump back spin around Im Mixed up
Say hi Crack you in the mouth and Kick dust
Big Truck roll up at the window of a pickup
Order a Quarter pounder while Im getting my dick sucked
Madchild remember my name cause Ill forget 
Bad temper I punch myself in the head 
Im up against a wall no one to protect me
Shoot my shadows had enough hes fed up he left me
Im all alone but I love being lonely
We outta the trees me and Moka only
Start a single fine line of the sane asylum 
Its hard to stay calm when your brain is whiling 
Im smiling but inside im screamin
Im a ragin demon but I love god pray every evening 
Seven, seven times Sometimes five 
I gotta do and say certain things before I drop
I aint think of particular stuff, just comes to me
Socials skills suck Im real bad company
Still got a long way to go I aint sweating 
Cause everyday another day Towards where Im Getting

[Chorus]

[Madchild]
You dont wanna push me past the edge 
You dont wanna cross the line till last you dead
Aint nothing new to me to that I seen it
You barkin up the wrong tree dog I mean it
My whole team fen fine in fuck
50 of us roll up in the club like what?
Everyone got a girl by the time we leave
You can best guess that people get fucked Up this evening 
Im  an American idol staple a maple leaf to my chest
Make believe Im the best 
Keep telling yourself that Soon I will be
Lets brainwash yourself till everyone feel me
Appeal to the masses that Im made for action
Suspenseful thriller its a fatal attraction
Your in for a big surprise dont wanna ruin it
No choice of course your influence Im doing it

[Chorus x2]

[Prevail]
Im throwin thunderbolts like Zeus Makin waves Like Poseidon
Ive got my license to kill you better believe that Im driving
Im Feelin live and on the go like double shots of espresso 
I know a couple girls thatll probably tell there friends Im an asshole
In the fast lane of entertainment keep your tank full
Watch your rear view and always be thankful
Before I make your neck sleep deep in tranquil 
And shoot a tranquilizer dart right into your ankle
And watch you slowly Rollin sell your soul to the crone
But You will not be comin back and blastin holes in me bro 
Once your done your done thinking your prev one
I count it down like an identity from ten to one
My only enemys the sun it restricts my movement
When the full moon blooms we make the sickest music
In the room full of bloodthirsty worthy students 
And soon youll find yourself under thee influence

[Chorus x2]
