[chorus:]
[nelly furtado]
im alive, 
i can feel the blood 
rushin thru my veins 
an thats all i need to know, 
cuz im not lookin for a change. 
cuz i got friends and enemies, 
but it just dont bother me, 
cuz as long as i believe, 
i can breath! 
[end of chorus]

[prevail]
metamorphis, battleaxe fortress, 
four-hundred horsepower 
full moon the sorceress 
swollen members an my girl, NF 
the predators an the terminator 
the tribes cold breath 
why we hurt em'later 
we can do so much damage now, 
they''ll truck em 
when i hit em 
so much garbage around 
yells, bells, and whistles 
like carnival sounds. 
phenominal adrenaline 
from the words of my mouth. 

[mad child]

to rap 
with brain damage im phat 
remain famished and stacked 
your playin with the 
praying mantis, 
infact you gigantic, 
you sink like titanic 
panic attack act up 
an im a  
crash into disaster 
smash like master-plaster, 
punker, 
rangle-monster wants 
to stomp ya

in recruitable times.

is take your soul an 
talent to 
the next plateau 
an balance 
who you try to think of times two
