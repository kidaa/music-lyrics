Burn it down
Burn it down

I just can't stop tonight
Cause its hot tonight
I'm gonna
Burn it down
I know we're feelin right
And I'm feelin' like I'm gonna
Burn it down
Ain't nothin gonna stop this train
Cause its off the chain
I wanna
Burn it down
Oh I wanna
Burn it down
Yeah you wanna
Burn it down

I poses more power than the marvel universe
You understand now
But you all looked startled at first
We don't play your game
We make up our own rules
I'm runnin on full strength
And pick up a phone booth
Throw it right at you
Battered I'm tattooed
Voice deeper than Abru
When I'm in a bad mood
This is my neighborhood
A place where you never could
Get over its over for you
You'd run if you knew what was good
For your health
I ain't huntin' for noone else
And there's noone else here
So you can quit yellin for help
Its like the house of 1000 corpses
For some its hideous
To me its gorgeous

Now spark your things
And make a frame
Tonight we gonna do it like we're all the same
Pyromaniacs burn this bitch
And now you're gonna learn who's turn this is
Light your shit up
Get up and move
You bring your fire
I got mine too
Plus we got nothin to proove
We're gonna burn it down
When we're Steppin'Thru

Yo,
Double fantasy
A crime and punishment
I don't think you understand the amount of astonishing
Thoughts that I'ma harnessing
An uncommon phenomenon
Our shits over the top
Covert op reconnaissance
? cannibals
I'm the most expandable
Dangerous man on the planet
You could fuck a farm animal
Don't panic
Its an insane maniac
Don't pay any attention
Of course I got problems
Too many dimension
Rappers commin up like "Whatcha got there,
Another Swollen Members album?
Its not fair!"
Please believe I'll be livin' illegal
If I can't keep sellin' CD's to people
But my voice is lethal
Beep I breathe easy
Your like I don't really wanna fuck with him
Me neither
I'm focused
Its nothin' to joke about
I'm loco
I vocally choke you out

I just can't stop tonight
Cause its hot tonight
I'm gonna
Burn it down
I know we're feelin right
And I'm feelin' like I'm gonna
Burn it down
Ain't nothin gonna stop this train
Cause its off the chain
I wanna
Burn it down
Oh I wanna
Burn it down
Yeah you wanna
Burn it down

Watch,
While I knock your socks off
I'm just here to make something abnoxious pop off
And I'ma kill it
Even if I have to talk soft
Let me turn this up
I'll make you crack your drop top
I can not stop
Its like a curse
You break your jaw
Just tryin' to recite my verse
I write raps in the sun
While I quench my thirst
Police helicopters gettin on my nerves
Emergency
You burn in third degrees
So be alert while I work
You could learn from me
Yeah I smoke cigarettes
I'm not back before
You say my name
Your liable to crack your molars
I don't rub shoulders
Schmooz or mingle
I pop X and vex
Drink booze and tingle
I just do enough
So the clubs can sing too
My song tellin me that
I love your single
I love your single
No you don't
Its just my pockets jingle
I know you want
You want keys,
And g's,
And all the other things
But slow your role ma
Cause I've heard a million things
But this time sixteen ain't enough
I got a couple more bars of the famous stuff
Its Moka O
My names like a stain in rust
It ain't about to disappear
Ya same with us
