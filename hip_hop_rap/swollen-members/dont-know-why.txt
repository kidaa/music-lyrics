[Chorus]
I dont know when the time will be 
Which side of me whom you might see
Be careful what you ask for 
Thats no lie sometimes we Just dont know why

[Moka Only]
Why do I do it like I do 
How come I dont get in trouble like I use to 
Why am I the last thing a girl understands 
Im just like the rest tryin to get inside her pants
Why dont I go and blow half  the enhance  
Buy a couple cars in my moms minivan
How come all I wanna do is make beats 
And eat like a pig eatin anything with cheese
How come I dont talk about MCs 
I dont talk about much anyway see
There aint a lot to say when you said it all before
So im gonna let the homeys come 
And tell you about some more 

[Chorus x2]

[Prevail]
Yo, We need no introductions  mention the relentless 
Why does my foe compare to those swing wrenches
Why do I believe that you control your own destiny 
Why wreck like psyclonlum my voice tone a sympathy 
Grind down the bones separate the Ligaments 
Why do I demonstrate how you could die from ignorance 
Its like drifting thru the twilight zone 
Imma highlight the parts that I think you should be shown
Why you wanna know how darkness feels 
I split your carcass in two parts like you aint real
Im beyond thats the law just in grandest scale
Youre my target my hand is steady as hell
Im prevail on scales like betoveen 
The mike in my hand conducts the same ocean
Why do I slice precise like Jack the ripper
Trip around dressed in black and slash you quicker

[Chorus x2]

[MadChild]
How come I dont use soap I sit in the bath cup of coffee
Have a couple smokes I dont know any jokes
All though I heard a ton of them I cant member none of them 
How come ever time I hang out with my friends 
I make fun of them hate the way I act when Im drunk  
But I drink insensitive invent the tension 
I dont think you couldnt bench press my stress this shit weighs a ton 
You couldnt shock me with a taser gun 
Nothing surprise me my whole tribes lively 
I got anger and confusion standing right beside me 
Thats why when Im alone at home Im not lonely 
Please do not drop by do not phone me 
Might be crazy but at least Im not home 
How come I dont follow trends got my own visions 
How come I dont try and talk to myself I wont listen, 
Why have I absorb this morbid war torpid 
I cant let go of this pain torture torment 
As sure Im as mirror less none conformance 
Love God but raise hell with the hot performance

[Chorus x2]
