[Mad Child]
My motorcycle rings are flooded
Im star studded
You motherfuckers not going to be able to cut it
Listen Bitch, I'm a tuff act to follow
Suck my dick, and here's a nut sack to swallow
Wanna get personal, close and intimate
Listen kid Im a whole different instrument 
Mental Im not sentimental
Im intrakit, its impossible not to get into it 
My intent to vent is not innocent
Im guilty of being real filthy with these meniscent ways   
It's time to finish ya faze
Im proof that raw adrenalin and energy pays 

[Chorus]
Your done your time is up
Its a bran new beat now turn it up turn it up
Swollens been coming up
Now watch these motherfuckers burn it up 
Your done your time is up
Its a bran new beat now turn it up turn it up
Swollens been coming up
Now watch these motherfuckers burn it up 

[Prevail]
Prevail Prevail baseball bat and nails
Im a menace to society, my records for sale 
Were back, back in black Im back at it
Attack were taking it back like dead rabbits 
Wreck havoc me and the metal metallic magic
My talents a canister of sinister gasses 
Storm like a fatuous this is my advantage
My tongues like a whip to administer lashes 
Molten ashes, fire and brimstone
You need to hire me to put a name on a tomb stone
Your fucking with the league of extraordinary gentlemen
Penalties of venom, and Armageddons millennium   
Bringing the hang man to measure the distance
To drop, and listen to the vertebrae pop 
Im a hurricane pops with the speed of a cheetah
Believe in the new school cause P's one of the leaders

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
There aint a thing that I cant do
Plus I act like Im straight out the Zyban to
Its just another mental verse to quench the thirst 
The vibes hit is makin' them say ah shit
Got a need to be stable and make profit 
Net cash and flip it, and triple it watch this 
Plus, what good it the dough if you cant blow it
What good is the goal if you stay below it 
Fools talk it when they aint got it
Come out ya wallet if you really ballin 
If you were about it then you wont be stallin 
Come off it yall Im off the wall
Im on the ball when you wanna ball dick and all 
Got a whole lot of products going to hit ya to 
I still walk the same walk but a different shoe
Its more comfortable and my whole click is to
Whatevers unpredictable is what were quick to do oompha

[Chorus]
