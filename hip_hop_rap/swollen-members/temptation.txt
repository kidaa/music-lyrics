Yo, I'm talking about 
Temptation things that run through your head
Like I wonder what my friend's girlfriends like in bed
Yo, I bet sometimes she thinks of me instead
Greed, That has to do with more than you need
Sin, That's usually where temptation leads
Turning into an addiction in an instant, take heed
Feeding off your ego, cash confusion and sex
That's why, like, every eight months
You end up back with your ex
For a couple days, and then remember 
Why it wasn't meant to be
Go your separate ways and think 
I wonder what got into me
You're done, but then another 
Eight months comes around eventually
Vicious circle, I've done some things 
That aren't worth mentioning
Temptation, made me do some things I regret
Easy to fall into, but hard to forget
Use to put the blame on others
But that's a bunch of nonsense
Now I try to focus and 
Just listen to my conscience

Yo, I'm talking about
Temptation and its relation to the human nation
The obvious, money, drugs, sexual frustration
How else can you explain public funding drain
The escalating murder rate and the climb to fame
It makes men touch parts that are not to be
It makes women clutch parts that are a part of me
So all that surface level services a day-to-day
An ongoing basis in desire and display
The first sensation recognized by script
We can't detach ourselves from it once we get into it
And why would we it feels better with the shadows closer
Comfortable feeling of comparing yours to overdose
Sometimes innocent and other times consequential
9 out of the ten times dun it's purely confidential
Harder to handle when your crews talking in your ear
Until you learn to abstain it draws near
Temptation
