Aiyyo, wordup Dunn 
Man you know how I feel 
Gotta be more to it than this, word up 
*Doing an impression of Scarface* 
This what it's all about Dunn? Uh? 
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking Can't understand 
Whattup, I don't know baby 
Nah man, it's not, it's not yo word up 
I'm tellin you right now 
I know this shit though, aiyyo 
Disagreeable, foul energy, tryin to 
absorb my energy, knowin it's the strength of me 
Take a few to give me a edge 
My green light shine bright, Kryptonite type 
Fully operational, my physical cream 
Put the bottles of smoke down, pick up a magazine 
Popped it inside the AR-15 
Put it aside, round up the regime 
While you rely on religion, I hold a nine 
on the mission, to pull fire on your opposition 
Revelation was the vision of this 
Crack the heavens, it's time to bring the business, shit 
My story goes back to them lost Pyramids 
I'm seeing things that you won't believe exists 
He use a Lunar-tick, suspended in time Dunn 
The secondary light got your mind 
You rock the fatigues, to squab until ?popular? guns 
But are you really prepared, for the things to come? 
[KRS-One]
Check it out 
True underground sound from the Boogie Down 
Uptown Downtown gather round for the showdown, in they faces 
Calling out these racists, at Rolling Stone 
Spin Details and other places, KRS is The Source 
Fuck these magazine leadin hip-hop off course 
You'll print about Black Mayors, Black Senators 
Why you ain't got no Black Editors? 
Everytime I do an interview in Rolling Stone 
They sendin me a writer that look like he's Home Alone 
Ignorant, to the culture and the microphone 
This has got to stop -- your whole spot 
is blown sky high, battle why try? 
My view is bird's eye, scopin with my third eye 
You don't understand, why you're publically banned 
until you recognize the writing skills of a black man 
Black Editor, all of us ain't thuggin 
Gossiping over who's homosexual 
Some of us are Black Intellectuals, up in Harlem World 
You can't get with me, so now in Midtown 
you wanna stop and talk to me? 
Bitch ass journalist, is this your fake hip-hop publication? 
Look I'm burnin this 
[Method Man] 
How many didn't want to see it happen 
Street moves, live from Staten, if life is a joke, nobody laughin 
Hate to see a brother do good through legal action 
So you sabotage and throw a Def in the Squad 
Fo'-fo's blastin, keep the po-po flashin 
these Dark Soul Assassins, Jake's hate the Gods with a passion 
So I keep it movin in an orderly, fashion 
Pedal to the floor -- peep the Jim Crow law, mind control theory 
Y'all niggaz don't hear me, Generation Next 
Droppin fast who's next, next to get wet 
by the reign of the tech-knowledgy, follow me 
Open up wide now, swallow me, every calorie 
is reality the truth, the whole truth and 
nothin but the truth, taste is the proof 
These niggaz want the Juice, and in the crossfire 
be the youth, who didn't learn to duck when they shoot 
[KAM]
What kind of party is this, it's that political kind 
Where America's best, most hypocritical minds 
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind 
And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime 
behind suits, and clean shaves 
I confuse em and use em as tools and slaves 
Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations -- 
I robs the damn nation 
so I can live in luxury, you fucks with me 
You marryin the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free 
I tell the people what they wanna hear 
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year 
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin 
and start back doin dope, cussin and fuckin 
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks 
That's my style, my pol-i-tricks 
Triple-Six convicts, lyin is automatic 
in the government, Republican or Democratic 
Fuck Freedom, Justice and Equality 
Nigga just accept my apology and suck this trick-knowledgy
