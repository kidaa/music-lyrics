I've got word of thanks 
Thanks that I'd like to say 
For the rage that I feel 
The rage that I feel today 

Gotta stack, gotta stack 
Stack of chips on my shoulder 
In everything I do 'cause I made, I made 
I made the mistake of trusting you 

Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
People like you just burn! 
You liar, you liar, you liar, you liar! 

Yeah, my layers are thick 
And I got a bad attitude 
Yeah, that knife in my back 
Has fingerprints that belong to you 

Got a grudge, got a grudge 
Got a grudge that I'm holding for as long as I live 
'Cause you lied, you lied, you lied to my face 
And that's something that I can't forgive 

Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
People like you just burn! 
You liar, you liar, you liar, you liar! 

Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
Yeah, people like you just fuel my fire 
People like you just fuel my fire 
While people like you just burn! 
You liar, you liar, you liar, you liar!
