Well this is where I kill the dancer 
Watch the MC kill the dancer 
Death of the Prodigy dancer 
Come on, come on 
Gonna take you with me 
Gonna kill you, gonna rock you 
Gonna move you, gonna groove you 
Tonight, come on 

Let it rock, let it move, let it move you, let it use you 
Let it move you, let it move you, let it move you 

One for the troubles 
Two for the time 
Three for the lyrics 
Four for the rhyme 

Come on now 
Let it rock, let it rock 
Pump it up, rock it up 
Don't stop to the fuckin' core 
Come on.. Maxim Reality is..? 

Let it rock you, let it rock you 
Let it move you, let it groove you 
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock 
Let it rock you, let it rock you, let it rock you 
Let it rock you, let it rock you 

Where's the response? 
Where's the response? 
Death of the Prodigy dancer 
Watch me kill the dancer! 
I'm a kill the dancer! 

Come on! 
Gonna kill you, gonna send you to the grave tonight, oh yeah that's right! 
Let it rock, let it move 
Let it move you, let it use you! 
Let it rock you, don't you stop! 

Gonna take you to the other side New York 
Let it move, let it move, let it move 
Let it move you 
Let it rock you, let it rock you 
Get ready 

One for the troubles 
Two for the time 
Three for the lyrics 
Four for the rhyme 

Let it rock you, let it move you 
Don't you stop, gonna take you 
To the top, oh yea 
You'll fail, we're for real 
Oh no!
