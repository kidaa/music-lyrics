Raise your fan up for the noise
Wake the dogs up, call your voice
Are you ready for the war?
Bring your colours to the floor

I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes

Show your colours
Bring your colours to the floor
Show your colours
Bring your colours to the floor

Wake yourself up, sirens on
'Cause we are fighting so exciting, now it's on
Are you ready for the war?
Show your colours
Bring your colours to the floor

I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes

Show your colours
Bring your colours to the floor
Show your colours
Bring your colours to the floor

I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes
I can see the look in your eyes

Show your color
