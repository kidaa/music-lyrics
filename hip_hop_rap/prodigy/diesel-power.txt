Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the format 
Build with skill with technique - computer A-DAT 
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm 
I get hyped, think, thought flow 

 Acrobat, sync the track, pump the track 
Dance missions, clubs close like spores react by past 
Strong visions, and hurrying more 
Reflects on the dancefloor 

Flow it up blowing up and having mad people showing up Note 
Packing crowds, jam packed venues 
Needles collapse, while atmospheres continues 
Sprinkle that, winnin' like that, movin' like that, hittin' like that 

The melody is fat phat Note 
Yeah, I'm on the energy source 
The cosmic boss with Prodigy 
Different astrology, my intellect's the power devour 

With Diesel Power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta... 

We spin back rewind - Diesel Power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantasically 
It has to be, automatically 
Check it out - you better work it out 

Change to another route 
My techniques, strategies, abilities 
I leave cords of mikes hanging like spring leads 
You would try so fast do a track, beyond the human eye 

Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics 
E's and pepped up, you get scrapped up Note 
Smacked up, backed up, your crew's all cracked up 
Checking flow, pick choose, quick, you can't stick 

My medical brain's a stranger's angles My medical  metaphor range is as strange as angles 
You get tangled, twisting side effects us twist inside affections 
Channels repeat, complete, can't compete 
Check that our texture, mind adventure 

 Exploit the point, it attracts to devour 
My intellects proceed - with diesel power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta... 

Back attack - and whack patch 
You're faxing me - you don't want none 
High quality acts should be still standing 
Damaging your other manic 

Quick reverse - potent as the first verse 
My amplifier blows on your world's higher 
World's sire, cuts like a barbed wire 
Record player, I pull up on you every day 

Fast forward, I move and I swings toward 
Exit load, put your brain in right mode 
Selected mix, the man will perfect the fix the man with perfected fix has lightly bite me 
Copy zimmers Xerox, cops' handblocks 

You can't knock some out there 
I'll be upbeat lifting, shifting, persisting, intelligent kingpin 
Keepin' astrology 
As I roll with Prodigy 

With Diesel Power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta... 

 Model 706-8073-421, Robot Sonic 

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...
