Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess whos back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? 1, 2, 3

They keep on sayin the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe theyre just tryna distract it
From the fact that Im comin back
Or maybe its cause I aint black, maybe its because of that
Maybe its because Im the highest sellin artist in rap
While Im sittin back in my office jackin off to my plaques
Im still sick, how can I be sick this long
And Im still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin my opponents think that Ive died
Thats when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man dont lay
In the sun cause I dont tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money weve earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20s still
And Fif here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he aint even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
Im just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, thats when I start spazzin
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
Im the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
Im a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanyes glasses!
