Baby Your Da Da Loves You Hey 
And I'ma Always Be Here For You Hey No Matter What Happens 
You're All I Got In This World 
I Would Never Give You Up For Nothin 
Nobody In This World Is Ever Gonna Keep You From Me 
I Love You

C'mon Hai Hai We Goin To The Beach 
Grab A Couple Of Toys And Let Da Da Strap You In The Car Seat 
Oh Where's Mama She's Takin A Little Nap In The Trunk 
Oh That Smell Whew Da Da Musta Runned Over A Skunk 
Now I Know What You're Thinkin It's Kind Of Late To Go Swimmin 
But You Know Your Mama She's One Of Those Type Of Women 
That Do Crazy Things And If She Don't Get Her Way She'll Throw A Fit 
Don't Play With Da Da's Toy Knife Honey Let Go Of It No 
And Don't Look So Upset Why You Actin Bashful 
Don't You Wanna Help Da Da Build A Sand Castle Yeah 
And Mama Said She Wants To Show How Far She Can Float 
And Don't Worry About That Little Boo Boo On Her Throat 
It's Just A Little Scratch It Don't Hurt Her Was Eatin 
Dinner While You Were Sweepin And Spilled Ketchup On Her Shirt 
Mama's Messy Isn't She We'll Let Her Wash Off In The Water 
And Me And You Can Pway By Ourselves Can't We

See Honey There's A Place Called Heaven And A Place Called Hell 
A Place Called Prison And A Place Called Jail 
And Da Da's Probably On His Way To All Of Em Except One 
Cause Mama's Got A New Husband And A Stepson 
And You Don't Want A Brother Do Ya Nah 
Maybe When You're Old Enough To Understand A Little Better 
I'll Explain It To Ya 
But For Now We'll Just Say Mama Was Real Real Bad 
She Was Bein Mean To Dad And Made Him Real Real Mad 
But I Still Feel Sad That I Put Her On Time Out 
Sit Back In Your Chair Honey Quit Tryin To Climb Out Wahh 
I Told You It's Okay Haihai Wanna Ba Ba 
Take A Night Night Nan A Boo Goo Goo Ga Ga 
Her Make Goo Goo Ca Ca Da Da Change Your Dia Dee 
Clean The Baby Up So Her Can Take A Nighty Nighty 
Your Dad'll Wake Her Up As Soon As We Get To The Water

Baby Don't Cry Honey Don't Get The Wrong Idea 
Mama's Too Sweepy To Hear You Screamin In Her Ear Ma Maa 
That's Why You Can't Get Her To Wake But Don't Worry 
Da Da Made A Nice Bed For Mommy At The Bottom Of The Lake 
Here You Wanna Help Da Da Tie A Rope Around This Rock Yeah 
We'll Tie It To Her Footsie Then We'll Roll Her Off The Dock 
Ready Now Here We Go On The Count Of Free
