[Just Blaze - Chorus:]
Some people ask me, where Ive been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
I play in the background, I dont back down
So dont get it twisted, tryna play me
First I come out, they underate me
Then I come back, still try to fade me
They say Im nasty, say Im crazy
Ask what I think, I say maybe
I fly away
It aint nothin in my way so I may aswell fly away
It aint nothin else to say so I may aswell fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
Cos Ive been to the top and theres nowhere else to go
The only way to see me is if you lookin up from down below
And theres nothin else to say so I may aswell fly away
And theres nothin in my way so I may aswell fly away
Im on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away

[Eminem - Verse 1:]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
Ima step up on the stage now, Im gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
And you aint gotta tell me notin boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit dont stink, I dont think so
Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll
Are you ready now, here we go
The bald eagle has landed
Im back in ya hair, sorry for leavin you stranded
Im twice as dread and evil and rancid
They cant sit, I dont think anybody understands it
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough
I aint got to play though, they say I died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, itd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star
I fuckin RV up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors
Get my back right
Now Im right back on you bastards
I was chasin the dragon, I dont know what happened
It was like the feelin I had when I first started rappin
I just couldnt seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, thats where Ive been at when...

[Eminem - Verse 2:]
I took a hiatus haters now Im back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
Im the *bang* you aint fuckin sick
The hospital wont even give you cough drops for course cocksucker
You think your hot, you aint even luke warm
My pubes hotter than you
Your soft I use fire to cool me off
I told em Ill grow up one day and show em Id be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightenin bolts and throw em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em
Make em swarm, make em fight over the shirts Ive worn
Sworn over my sweat towels, its mind blowin
Yes Im livin the dream homie, cant nothin compare
Im so up, Im stuck in mid air Im lovin it yeah
Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters is so pussy theyre afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe em back pay
They spat in my face, now Im back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste,
And slap it back out, before I step back out of this crap thanks
Slap me now Im slapping em back hey! fuck it well slap back
But yeh okay now well talk cause Im smack ay
And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack
Hows that for hindsight, what the track say?
