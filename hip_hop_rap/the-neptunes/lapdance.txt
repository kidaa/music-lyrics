[Verse 1] Pharrell
I'm an outlaw I'm an outlaw
Quick on the draw Quick on the draw
Somethin you've never seen before Never Seen
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
I got somethin chrome I got somethin chrome
And I got it from home I got it from home
And it ain't a microphone It ain't a mic
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
It's so real! How I feel!
Cause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill!
I'm just straight ill! Ridin my motorcycle down the streets
While politicians - is soundin like strippers to me
They sayin, but I don't wanna hear it...

[Chorus] Vita
Oooh baby you want me?
Oooh baby you want me?
Oooh baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Well you can get this lap dance here for free
Oooh baby you want me?
Well you can get this lap dance here for free

[Verse 2] Pharrell
It's a raw night It's a raw night
Who wants to bar fight? Who wants to bar fight?
Well come on alright Y'all come on
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
Baseball bats Baseball bats
I got somethin for that I got somethin for that
It goes bla ka ka kat You know what that is
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
It's so real! How I feel!
Cause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill!
I'm just straight ill! Ridin my motorcycle down the streets
While the government - is soundin like strippers to me
They keep sayin, but I don't wanna hear it...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] Lee Harvey
When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley
Blue denim, spiked wrists and gone be
Slap-screws and tattoos that's all me
Two blondes, both arms feelin like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whippin it might crash
Or find me chillin with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court, smokin that nice grass
Burnin the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm I'm gnarly baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly baby
And you know the flow ungodly baby
So lets party baby..
Chicks nickname me powder, they get high off my dick
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cock-pit
Time for take off, they panties they drop quick
Now that's first class fuckin, ain't that some fly shit?

[Chorus]
