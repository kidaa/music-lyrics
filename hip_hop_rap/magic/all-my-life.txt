Tell me can I talk to you 
Girl where do you come from 
Ive been looking for you 
All of my life 

Even though I barely know you boy 
I think maybe tonights the night 
Cause ive been looking for your love 
All of my life 

[verse 1:]
Its two o'clock in the morning 
And im still wide awake 
Writtin letters to you girl but 
I threw them all away 
Because I 
I wanna show what i feel for ya but 
These words and this paper 
Just aint good enough for ya 
How can i prove to ya that girl 
You live inside my mind and 
I can see your pretty face everytime i close my eyes 
Something about the way we meet 
The day we meet i cant forget 
I played this song again and again and i 
I tell myself that one day 
You gonna be my special queen 
Convince myself you feel the same way for me and 
Even though we just meet 
It feels so right 
This is going down tonight 

[chorus]

[verse 2:]
Girl i can tell the way you feelin 
Your smile is so revealin 
That sparkle in your eyes 
Got me knowin that your willin 
To take a ride with somebody like me 
Lets take a chance girl and 
You could be my royalty, my loyalty 
From this night until the very end 
Its like a game we play 
But everyone wins 
Si tu fueras mi reina yo te regalaria todos mis dias momentos llenos de alegria 
You got me feanin 
For the taste 
Of just one kiss 
Im fantasing of what 
Its like and i 
Cant stop this 
I think im goin crazy 
So tell me can we talk pretty lady 

[chorus]

[verse 3:]
Now ive been looking for this baby 
Girl all of my life 
The type of mamasita 
Thats down for mine and 
If you feel the same way 
Let me know girl 
Let me know mama c'mon 

Cause now ive been looking for this baby 
Girl all of my life 
The type of mamasita 
Thats down for mine and 
If you feel the same way 
Let me know girl 
Let me know mama c'mon 

[chorus]
