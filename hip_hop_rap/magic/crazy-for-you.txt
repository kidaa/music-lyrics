[chorus] 
Have you ever met somebody, 
That will love you like i do? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 
And have you ever loved somebody, 
That will give it all for you? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 

[verse 1] 
I've always been by myself, 
Lived life by myself. 
Never cared for solitute, 
Just cared for the wealth. 
Steady stacking never slacking, 
With no time to be wasted. 
While these other dudes 
Be chasing 'em bras, 
I was chasing the paper. 
But then, but then 
Came you. came you 
And you was over baby, 
I was going crazy for you. 
And I haven't felt this way in a minute. 
And I'm not going to lie to ma. 
I think I'm starting to dig it. 
Everything about you is what I like. 
I go crazy and I lose my mind. 
Trade my world and I'd give my life. 

[chorus] 
Have you ever met somebody, 
That will love you like i do? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 
And have you ever loved somebody, 
That will give it all for you? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 

[verse 2] 
And every day you make clear, 
That you don't want to be replaced, 
By them little you do, 
Just by them little things you say. 
Five years then pass, 
And we have been through some drama. 
From quates to miss carriages, 
From losing your mama. 
Well now, well now 
I see, I see 
That your my only baby. 
Oh, I'm going crazy. 
I can't eat, can't eat 
Can't sleep, can't sleep 
No more, no more. 
It's like I like I toss and turn at night. 
Memories of pain. 
I keep hearing you laughing, 
Screaming calling my name. 
Then my eyes open wide, 
And I see you ain't there. 
Then the joy of the music, 
Turns into perminit tears. 

[chorus] 
Have you ever met somebody, 
That will love you like i do? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 
And have you ever loved somebody, 
That will give it all for you? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 

[verse 3] 
My only sanity of these walls, 
Is just the thought of you. 
Paridise up in my mind, 
About just for second or two. 
But then it's gone, long gone 
And I got to go too. 
Because I changed my way ma, 
I'm coming home to you. 

[chorus] 
Have you ever met somebody, 
That will love you like i do? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you. 
And have you ever loved somebody, 
That will give it all for you? 
I'm going crazy, crazy for you
