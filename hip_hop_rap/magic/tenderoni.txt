And close ma eyes 
When i got u sitting by side 
When i feeel that sexy body 
Rubbing up all over mine. 
That is when i know

More then a homie 
When the lights go down 
You are all up on me. damn... 
Now i gotta show u mamma 
Toching places u wannna 
So hot like Arizona 
In wada California 
Cause you are ma tendoreni 
That i been tryin'to find 
Tell me your fanacys 
And all your secrets on ur mind 
Lets roll on a hotel suit 
Londery and your preety feet 
Loook so good that i wanna eat 
I think ur twisting me 
And i know u love this place 
So goo like birthday cake 
Lets pu it down like Bobby Brown 
And ma man Baby Face 

[chorus]

Use to a time 
When i skipped the game 
Always got a girl fora different date 
Its funny how life takes a sudden change 
Cause then i all pimp up on ma brain 
Got one girl that makes me hold all of the other girls are at the front door 
Was one to be grown 
But i will sit back and drop slow 
Got a lot of mooney u know that 
So let me keep you like a polar cat 
Get a gicci bag to match 
And then get the shows to go with that 
I love it when you walk down reprcenting 
Jay sat suit to the fullest stand
