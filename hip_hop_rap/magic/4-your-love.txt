Any breath I take 
I think a more 
Those things so deep to demonstrate 
Oh Love 

Any time I close my eyes I see 
Your lovely smile 
Shine and light 'cause I 

Now I realize what I havin' 
What I've lose 'cause
Think I'll live in the fame 

Now I realize what is changin' 
What is missin'
Why they don't live now 

For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh
For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh

For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh
For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh

All this time 
I'd try to made you find someone 
Oh god 
Try to take your face 

First to looking for you 
Since I'm risin' someone else 
But you are not there 

Now I realize what I'd havin' 
What they'd lose 'cause
Why they live in the fame 

Now I realize what is changed 
What is missed 
Why they don't live now 

For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh
For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh

For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh
For your love I would do anything 
Do anything 
Do anything Oh oh
