hey, you said it ain't bad to unveil your politics
and hey, you said it ain't bad to show your special tricks
you'll find out, wait patiently and let things take their course 

hey, you shouldn't keep back your thoughts and good ideas
and hey, you shouldn't detect your ancient fears
it's yourself who keeps working the idea behind it all 

ref
and the open source is on your mind
let the inspiration be your satellite
disclose your sources and feel free to gain an insight 

hey, you said it ain't bad to believe in openness
and hey, you said it ain't bad to invest in your progress
it so easy to be part of it 

hey, you said it ain't bad to unveil your politics
and hey, you said it ain't bad to show your special tricks
you'll find out, wait patiently and let things take their course 

share the liberty, I care for the things in me
and pass them all to you
share the sources, enjoy the forces
that spread between us all
