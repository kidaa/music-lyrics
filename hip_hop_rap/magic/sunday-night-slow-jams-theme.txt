[Intro: Talkbox] 
It's sunday night sunday night. Sunday Night Slow Jam. 

[Chorus:]
It's sunday night. I wanna hold you tight. let's make love tonight Turn up the sunday night slow jams. It's sunday night, I wanna love you for the rest of my life, sunday night slow jam. 

[Verse 1:]
I promise girl to save every sunday. Just you and me forever for always. Its like something that was meant to be, like a gift from the heavens that was sent to me. Por eso mi amor you could count on me. Lets runaway together 'til eternity. For the queen of my soul, reina de mi amor, an oral expression just to let you know our love. 

Play another slow jam for me and my girl every sunday night 

[Chorus:]
It's sunday night. I wanna hold you tight. Turn up the sunday night slow jams. It's sunday night, I wanna love you for the rest of my life, sunday night slow jams
