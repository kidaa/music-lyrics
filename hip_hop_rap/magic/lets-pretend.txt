Yeah, What's up girl? 
Come here I wanna holla at you right quick. Check it out. 

[Chorus 2x:]
Lets just pretend, 
That I'm yours and you are mine. 
Forget about the world, 
Baby be my girl, 
It's going down tonight. 

[Verse 1:]
Check it out. 
If I, had a girl like you I'd need nobody else inside my days 
It's that connection that we makin when you walk my way 
It's more than just your body with that pretty face and eyes 
They say the grass is always greener on the other side 
I wanna show you the things you never felt inside 
Like how it feels making love under the stars at night 
So tell your girls that you gon' leave with somebody else tonight 
You're like that drug I wanna hit so we can both get high 
So lets ride to the south westside 
with your body all over mine 
Take them other fools off your mind 
It ain't no crime when I'm stealing your kisses 
Push your body to the limit girl, fulfillin your wishes 
Damn, This ain't no one night stand 
I ain't gotta be your man 
Let's just pretend girl, cuz nothing ever goes as planned 
And if you need me one more night, that'll be alright with me 
You got me twisted, body gifted, you're my ecstacy 

[Chorus: 2x]
Lets just pretend, 
That I'm yours and you are mine. 
Forget about the world, 
Baby be my girl, 
It's going down tonight. 

[Verse 2:]
From the moment that we caught eyes 
She was on my mind 
It's like I woke up dreamin, thinking of her and I 
Alone doing things on our own, And I'm all making a lie 
Full on with our own home, kids, and a ride 
Ride with no fears near right by my side Lost when we look in our eyes 
Now I ain't going insane 
I'm usually playin' 
But I swear it was love at first sight 
Now I seen her with a man being dragged by her hand 
And it seemed he was beatin her dead 
What a beautiful face with the wrong man at the right place with her head down 
Now let me take it away take the pain away 
Happiness like a place to stay 
Let's pretend like we've already been 
With time girl I know you can break away, Make away, Girl I'd break my back just to stake my
place 
Anything just to make you stay 
With no doubts in my mind 
And I'm hatin myself Cuz you don't even know my name 
But I know cuz your eyes are the keys to your soul 
And through them 
Your story is told 
Just let go of it all 
Let go of that dawg 
And let me show you what it is to grow 
I know your missing a part 
I got the keys to your heart 
Let me put the love back in place 
Leave the world behind 
I'll close your mind 
And I don't doubt that we can get away 
Get a place 
Stick by your side 
Through the darkest days 
Make love in so many ways 
I played for so long 
Gotta love for a change 
But I'd trade it all for your face 

[Bridge:]
I'd trade it all for your face 
The way your eyes just look at me the way they look at me 
Of all the girls I've ever seen 
Your body is somethin' you do to me 
And I don't know if you got a man I don't know 
But I just wanna take your hand 
Come with me girl again and again 
Even if it's just pretend 

[Chorus: 2x]
Lets just pretend, 
That I'm yours and you are mine. 
Forget about the world, 
Baby be my girl, 
It's going down tonight
