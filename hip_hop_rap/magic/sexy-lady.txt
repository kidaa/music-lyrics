Quiero que sepas que todos los dias 
Solo pienso en ti 
Eres la reina de mi vida 
Mi corazon es para ti 
I wanna treat you like a queen 
I wanna love you tonight 
Sexy lady with the pretty brown eyes let me know if you down to ride 

I remember when i met you 
You was stading with your friends at the bar looking so fly 
From the hotel sweet to the bubbles in the bath tub 
No matter what you want to do i got your back love 
Let me give it to you baby let me rub your back 
As a matter of a fact 
With the lights down low with the beat thats slow imma make you loose control 
Let me touch them private places 
Homerun hit like four bases 
Making all them sexy faces 
Damn girl you drive me crazy 
I wont stop until the panties drop 
Foggy windows in the parking lot 
Holiday inn or the mary yaht 
Dime lo que quieras i make it real hot 

[Chorus]
Quiero que sepas que todos los dias 
solo pienso en ti 
eres la reina de mi vida 
mi corazon es para ti 
I wanna treat you like a queen 
I wanna love you tonight 
Sexy lady with the pretty brown eyes let me know if you down to ride 

let me know girl 

Let me treat that body like a playground 
From the top of the slide to the mary go round 
Dont stop till you get enough 
Till your eyes roll back and your legs lock up 
Ooh wee i know you like that feeling when im killing 
That kitty kat kat and i break your back and you loose your breathe like a carty yat 
Must me that sex maniac in me 
Gotta hit it one time or maybe three 
You know that i gotta make it hotter than a hundred degrees 
Tell me one thing 
In the morning when you wake up 
What you wanna do 
Yo quiero hacer el amor with nobody else than you 

[Chorus]

I told you lady that im going to love you so right 
Let me touch that body in the places that nobody has ever touched before 
Let me just love you right let me show you what i feel 
Your my one and only lady and thats why our love is so so real 

[Chorus]
