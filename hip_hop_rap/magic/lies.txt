Why would you lie to me? 
After all that we've been through, 
After the love I gave you, 
I just need you to trust me 

[Bridge:]
How could i trust you 
how do I move on 
When all you do is tell your lies, 
your killin me inside. 
Why would I take you back 
so many sleepless nights 
we had a good thing but you threw it all away 

[Verse 1:]
They said you dont know what you got until its all gone 
I wish I never had to sit down and write this song 
But baby girl, if I coulf turn back the hands of time 
if I could press rewind, live it one more time 
I wouldnt do the things i did, 
I take back what I said, 
I never break a promise 
if you take me back again. 
Everyone deserves a second chance and this is it, 
so reach inside your heart and be compassionate girl, 
did you forget the way we use to love each other, 
the way you told me that you could never love another 
damn, its like im beggin you to stay alive, 
I love you girl and I need you by my side 

[Chorus:]
You could tell your lies 
I dont really care what you feel inside 
all you ever did was make me cry 
maybe one day you'll realize 
that you had a good girl in your life 

I dont really care what you feel inside 
all you ever did was make me cry 
maybe one day you'll realize 
that you had a good girl in your life 

[Interlude:]
I know you really dont mean the things 
you said right now 
baby c'mon girl 
see all I need is one more chance 
to show you that I never gonna do you wrong again 
please girl c'mon 

[Chorus 2:]
I still remember promises of making it together 
forgive and forget 
we can still be forever 
the key to my happiness, 
my life is in your hands, 
I'll do whatever just to kiss your lips again. 
Come close to me girl, 
so you can feel what im sayin 
Im serious and I cant take it, 
no more playin. 
Today is the first day of the rest of my life, 
I wanna spend every moment with you 
makin it right and 
I know that maybe this can take a long time and 
I know that its always in the back of your mind but 
I know that you deserve the stars in the sky 
so if you give me one last chance 
I'll never make your cry 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
