1 You say you gonna get him nigga

D.I.G.:
You damn right I'mma get him, cut him and split him
>From his neck down lettin' him know I ain't bullshittin'
He shouldn't fucked around wit' Mr. Magic
He should of known shit get drastic when you start static
I burn niggas like lastic so they won't come back
They try to get to you, but feel the heat from the gak
I bust his ass have him fall flat to the ground
Hit'em twice in the head and walk away wit' a smile
Oh wha cha want me to do, bring him to you, and you watch me kill him
So you can see the blood drippin' 
and know I did it and know D.I.G. stay committed
Cuz you my nigga anything for you
I pull the trigga and be the green filla
Fuck that nigga I'mma get'em
That nigga history, I'mma put him out of his misery
You make him feel it, that not to play with these real niggas
A TRU nigga.....Ya Dig Nigga
Chorus 2x:
1 So you say you gonna get him nigga

Magic:
Its a shame this all started as a misunderstanding
There is no turning around because my money is demanded
Now I gotta call the fuckin bandit ...D.I.G.
Leavin' muthafucka's where they standing, single handed
Choppin one by fuckin' one and hit me on the cell 
When the fuckin' job is fuckin' done
Man do this for me dawg and I'll return the fuckin' favor
Cuz his momma know my face, I mean she's practically my neighbor
But I'm all about my paper we went together on a caper
And I ain't got my ends, this muthafucka gots to pay
I mean 3 people died and I ain't got a fuckin' quarter
But if my plans go right they'll be fo dead by tomorrow
But my heart feels no sorrow, he deserves to fuckin' die
Shit I did all the shootin', this nigga spending mind
He saw the killa in my eyes now he gonna feel my fire
Say bye-bye to the bad guys, yo life has been expired
Chorus:
1 So you say you gonna get him nigga
2   You damn right, I'mma get him
1 Throw a slug in his head nigga
2   You fuckin right, I'mma split him
1 Do exactly what I said nigga
2   Don't worry about it dawg, Its on
1 Cuz I want this nigga dead nigga
2   Off top, this nigga gone

2Well dawg, look its all good I know you'll do the same for me thats
   why I picked up the peace at anytime and put a nigga to sleep
1shhh!!Nigga take these couple G'z and head to Hawaii, lay low until
   I say so and I'mma make sho no one follow
2Nah soldier keep yo money, I don't really need it, I enjoyed killin'
   that nigga while you watchin' him bleed
1Well, did your dick get hard when he took his last breath, I just get so
   excited in the presense of death
