[CHORUS 2X]
Ya no quiero llorar 
Y no quiero sufrir 
Necestio tu amor 
Yo me muero sin ti 

I told you when I met you, that I had someone in my life 
I wont tell if you wont tell, is what you said that night 
You remember it started as a game, 
But when you play with fire, sometimes you cant put out the flame 
You said that you's a big girl, understood the circumstances 
Never took for granted sneak away romances 
Tonight's the last night, I cant go on like this 
Gotcha cryin' on my shoulder, tryna beg me not to leave 
Por favor no llores, girl I gotta go 
Estoy perdiendo tu llanto rompe el Corazon 
And if I stay 5 minutes I just might give in 
It's a battle I cant win, more than just a sin 
Made a promise to myself, plus someone else 
From this day until the end, I gotta be somebody else 
Forgive me mama if I'm making you cry, 
I never meant to change your life but I gotta say good-bye 

[CHORUS]
Ya no quiero llorar 
Y no quiero sufrir 
Necestio tu amor 
Yo me muero sin ti 

So many times you make mistakes, lying to the ones we love 
I should've seen this coming, but I chose to be the selfish one 
My mind is thinking, I'll just see her one more time 
No more sneaking away to hotel, telling these lies 
But every time we see each other, I cant let go 
Still my thoughts are saying, you got a good girl at home 
A good mama to the kids after she's been working all day 
Does she deserve to be treated, in the like of this way'.no 
But on the other hand, I got you on the phone 
Telling me that you cant wait, to have me in your arms 
Damn I'm going crazy, losing my mind 
I shouldn't see you on the side, but it feels so right 
Maybe after tonight we can say good-bye 
And I'm thinking to myself, this has got to be the last time 
Ya no llores baby girl don't cry, 
You deserve somebody better thats gonna love you right

[CHORUS 2X]
Ya no quiero llorar 
Y no quiero sufrir 
Necestio tu amor 
Yo me muero sin ti
