Bitch Ass,
I ain't looking for no gun play so why you got your hand on your grip ?
I got my fist balled up because I'm ready to fight bitch
I can hear a lot of yapping, but I just don't see no action
What you done forgot how to walk ? Nigga you ain't bout no scrappin
Bitch you low offendin me so no matter what you getting wooped
I'm gon shake you with the first punch and take you out wit the hook
An old fashioned ass woopin you run yo mouth to much
We couldn't talk it over like men I had to reach out and touch
Yo man hood and yo jaw up at the same time
Don't get up off the ground boy cause victory is mine
Don't let this embarrassment get that ass killed
Try to retaliate nigga and yo cap I will pill
Respect my heart I was born with thug in my blood 
Respect my mind unless you just ready to die 
Nigga picture me I'm like Tyson and Holyfield back to back
And in a matter of seconds I'll lay this whole club flat
Look at you now PUNTA ! damn look at him
This is what you send at me
These are your fuckin niggaz lyin on the ground naw naw
I told you bitchez don't fuck wit me
You fuckin cockaroaches don't want none
What ? What the fuck are looking at ? nothing man, nothing
You still want some ? naw
Send the rest of yo gumba's and take it to the streetz 
naw we don't won't no problems, we don't got no problems
{Chorus Magic}
If you got beef 
Then take it to the streetz HA HA !
Throw up yo hands motherfucka let's see if you really got beef
If you got beef 
Then take it to the streetz HA HA !
Throw up yo hands motherfucka let's see if you really got beef
If you got beef 
Then take it to the streetz HA HA !
Throw up yo hands motherfucka let's see if you really got beef
If you got beef 
Then take it to the streetz NIGGA !
Throw up yo hands nigga let's see if you really got beef
Verse 2:
Now you was suppose to be bad HUNGH
You was suppose to be ruff WHAT
But you done fucked up 
Now I'm bout to tear this fuckin club up
You don't wanna battle me hand on hand combat
I'm like a gladiator demolish you nigga and that's that
It's a fact 
I can tell by the way that you act
You jus a bitch made nigga thats need of a smack
Any hoe that you came wit she leavin wit me Come on hoe
I done ruined yo reputation now stay off the street
You jus a lil born pussy that waitin to get fucked 
Suckered for the right, Momma never told you to duck
Left right combo I'm gon drop all of you niggaz 
Before I finish 
I want to know how the fuck did you figure
That you can stand around wit Mr. Magic 
This some shit I can't tolerate I can't have it
You couldn't beat me if I tied my fuckin hands to my feet 
You want me then nigga take it to the street
{Chorus Magic}
You got beef 
Then take it to the streetz HA HA !
Throw up yo hands motherfucka let's see if you really got beef
You got beef 
Then take it to the streetz NIGGA !
Throw up yo hands nigga let's see if you really got beef
