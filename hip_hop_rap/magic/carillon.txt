Last night I had a dream
Where I was all alone walking on the street
My carillon and me
Were two inseparable strange melodics

Nobody was around
The silence and the gloom werw so profound
I started to explore
But you were the only one I was looking for

I've never had a dream
Where I was singing that strange melody
My carillon and me
Were dancing on the world for eternity

Now that I am awake
I still feeling the call that I won't forsake
It's an elusive love
That you contain into seven strange notes

I am a carillonneur and I play the carillon
I am a carillonneur and I play the carillon
