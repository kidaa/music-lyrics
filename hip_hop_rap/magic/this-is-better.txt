What is better?
this is better?
do feel better
do it together

When the sunset
shines its colors
in my deep soul
I feel better

When your bright eyes
look at me so
in my hard heart
I feel better
and i really feel better
'till when i'm so close to you
I cannot resist you baby
when you're close to me

and nobody can't stop me baby
when i'm so close to you
I desire to touch you baby
when you're close to me

do you ever move your body
keep on dancing
it's a party............ x2
