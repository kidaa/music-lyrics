I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby Hello, oh no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky...
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this--
It's centrifical motion
It's pertpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment
It's Impossible
This Kiss, This Kiss
Unstoppable
This Kiss, This Kiss
Cinderella said to Snow White
How does love get so off course?
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse.
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby, I'm forever yours
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this--
It's centrifical motion
It's perpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment
It's Unthinkable
This Kiss, This kKss
Unsinkable
This Kiss This Kiss
You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let every thing slide
You got me floating, You got me flying
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this--
It's centrifical motion
It's perpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment
It's Subliminal
This Kiss, This Kiss
It's Criminal
This Kiss, This Kiss
