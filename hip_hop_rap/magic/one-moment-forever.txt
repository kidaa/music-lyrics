Everywhere I go every place I know

what a wonderful world this is

everytime I see what it meens to me

to believe in our destiny



see the light the time is right what a sight

here`s what we`ve been dreaming of



let`s take it to the world for nw and ever

let`s take it to the world now that we`re togheter

once in a lifetime this is the right time one moment forever



let`s take it to the world...



everything can be what your eyes can see

in a wonderful world like this

everyone`s the same in a children`s game

what a wonderful chance is this



see the light the time is right what a sight

here`s what we`ve been dreaming of



let`s take it to the world for know and ever

let`s take it to the world now that we`re togheter

once in a lifetime this is the right time one moment forever



let`s take it to the world...
