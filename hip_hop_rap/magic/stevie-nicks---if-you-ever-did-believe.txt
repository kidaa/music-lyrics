Written by Stevie Nicks

You've left me now
and it's seasoned my soul
And with every step you take,
I watch another part of you go...

I continue to build a wall...
You were so strong, 
I fell to my knees...
And I don't think I can handle this at all...

One more night 
I'd like to lie and hold you
Yes and feel...
To make you smile,
I'd like to be there for you--
Have you forgotten me?

And the days go by
Doing nothing about them...
How much time
will I have to spend?

My mind won't rest
and I don't sleep
Not even in my dreams...

If you ever did believe, 
for my sake...
If you ever did believe....

And the days go by
Doing nothing about them...
How much time
will I have to spend?

ooo....ooo.....ooo...
Ooo baby don't leave me
ooo..ooo...ooo...ooo
I'm down on my knees...
ooo..ooo...ooo...ooo
begging you please...
ooo...ooo...ooo...ooo
baby don't leave me....
Did you ever believe?
