Michelle Lewis/Wayne Cohen

Da da da...mmmm..oh ho...

She's been traveling the sidewalks for hours
Stopping as every moment of the truth wanders past
Window shopping for religion or something harder
Than the coins in her pocket

She is way too pretty for prime time New York
She gets the business every time she takes a walk
Amid the shark-smile porno scenes
But they can't ever touch her - their disappearing queen

She is...
Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
at the same time 

She's as shady as cheap sunglasses
But as perfect as this October Monday passes
To a draggin'-your-soul-around-town rhythm
Always in such a hurry, but never too fast
Playing chicken with delivery boys and tag with the subways
Searchin' alleys for proper company
She's jumping in and out of cracks
And she's got everything that you lack
Well she entered unnoticed
You will feel it when she leaves

She is...
Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
at the same time 

Ahhhh..

We belong...in gutters and glittering lobbies
We belong...to a street lamp flickering out
We belong...to absolutely nothing

Getting out of a taxi the other day
My heart fell out of my backpack and into a puddle
And so my chest was empty but it felt okay
I just fished out the pieces and walked away into...

Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
at the same time

aahhh..

We are
Nowhere and everywhere
You're feeling close but nothing's there
We are
nowhere and everywhere
at the same time

Heeyyyy...

Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere
Nowhere and everywhere.....
