Here's that fire shit right here
Here's that top of the line cali
ya heard me?
Look.....
Hey brother it's that fire we aint gotta do all that but pass it
You gonna learn how to use that rotation dogg
It's like this..
Chorus 4X
Puff Puff pass the shit 
hurry that's doulja bitch 
you used to smoking that regular shit
so hurry up and pass it 
[Magic]
Pass me the dope man and let me smoke, 
high as a kite and I'm bout to choke
I'm so used to it it's hard to cope, 
seems like everything is a joke
Moving in slow motion, crying against the potion
got me what the feeling I need
I just wanna smoke all day, sippin cran and tangeraie 
with my windows down hollerin' at people from 'round my way
Now get this I'm with the good shit I'm through with smoking bullshit
I gotta connect, that's full in effect, and that's our little secret
I ain't gonna lie my troubles sorrow, help me put down my revolver
it gotta be good anytime that I can smoke it with my father
It never harmed me solely or some people say it do 
I never heard of no one dying over weed and that's the fucking truth
So I'ma smoke and I'ma smoke until the day I fucking die
very seldom you will catch me without a gloss in my eye
Smelling like a pound of indonesia, that other shit will tease ya
you need something to please ya, send you into seizures
Chorus 4X
[Magic]
Smoking on that fire, really get's me higher, 
keep my fucking mind at ease
since I been smoking doja, 
I can't keep my composure, can you roll another one please?
My moma don't like it but I'ma grown man,
and she just don't understand
that when I'm red I'ma better man, but still bout my cheddar man
I went to Jamaica and smoked myself crazy with my lady
trying to make a baby, right after C-Murder paid me
My habit is as own the week, glancing as a nigga as he ease in peace
so why the fuck the police keep on trippin on me?
I aint about no trouble when I'm high, 
you think I won't fight shit I'm too tired
You can cuss me out I look in your face and pass you by
If I was the president I'd make this shit legal
Cause if everybody was high then nobody would think of evil
Am I ever gonna quit this shit?  Man you got to be jokin'
As a matter of fact please excuse me while I'm smokin'
Chorus 4X
