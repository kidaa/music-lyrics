
Ima keep it a thousand
Its been a good year
But I feel like next year will be better
For you Dramatic, and for us

I can see the money coming with my eyes close Damn Right
When comes to that grind nigga anythang goes I know u feel me Damn Right
I'ma always get that dough Damn Right
I'm trying get it back you know Damn Right
I'm worth a Mil on the low Damn Right
I can feel it boy I'm close Damn Right

Ok it started with a nigga that just had them hoop dreams
Then I fell in love with music I was only 13
Grab the mic started flowing plenty doubted I kept going
Plenty years in that booth perfecting craft I had to show em
While y'all sleeping I was working all night getting it in
Mama looking at me crazy cuz I failed a class again
Couldn't work a 9 to 5 cuz that shit ain't for me
In my head had vision one day I'll be on TV
Putting on for side but I knew I had to grind
It ain't happen overnight man this shit took sometime
Stayed focus had a dream then I hit them billboards
And I'm only getting started I gotta plan nigga what's yours
4real

I can see the money coming with my eyes close Damn Right
When comes to that grind nigga anythang goes I know u feel me Damn Right
I'ma always get that dough Damn Right
I'm trying get it back you know Damn Right
I'm worth a Mil on the low Damn Right
I can feel it boy I'm close Damn Right

I got the world in my hands I control the show
See that money I done seen that shit come and go
With these bitches they gone love yo ass until u broke
That's why the only thang she get from me is that good stroke
Love will get you killed I'm cold inside just like a freezer
I outwork these niggas I earn my spot just like a cheetah and
Yo ho gone let me slide through don't need no visa
First they hated then I turned they asses to believers
Damn in due timein due time I'll be fineI'm good
Tell'em ketchupKetchup lil nigga I ain't talking HeinzOh no
Them hating niggas we don't see those
I get high just to balance lows I'm in control so u know

I can see the money coming with my eyes close Damn Right
When comes to that grind nigga anythang goes I know u feel me Damn Right
I'ma always get that dough Damn Right
I'm trying get it back you know Damn Right
I'm worth a Mil on the low Damn Right
I can feel it boy I'm close Damn Right
