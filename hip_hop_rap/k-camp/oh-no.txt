But nigga I aint worried about shit, shit
Ridin' 5 deep in that tahoe my nigga, we pushin that dance for a cheque
Bitches keep talkin, theyre runnin they mouth

In the cut with your bitch, relaxin'
Mama Said Chase That Dough Doe
And Never Stress Bout No Ho No

Niggas be talkin 'bout all of their money
But all of their money, my nigga we got it
Dont need no wallet, I'm fly as a pilot
My niggas we outchea, My niggas we whylin'
More style than the stylist, I'm jumpin ya modest
Im getting the paper and I dropped out of college
Boy I'm so bout it, they asked who the hottest
I looked in the mirror and almost forgot it
Sike, no I didn't, boy I m so cold
I might need some mittens
Beam me up Scotty, Im looking for pippen
You are not getting no money, you trippin'
KOD monday, this nigga is tippin'
Niggas so pussy, they acting like kittens
Dunk on that bitch boy, I feel like blake griffin
Say what you say
But my nigga, we did it

I cant trust these niggas, I cant trust these hoes, Oh no
I can tell I got these haters pissed, I know, I know
I dont give a damn about none of these niggas
I dont give a damn about none of these bitches
