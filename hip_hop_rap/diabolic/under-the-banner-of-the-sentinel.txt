Thunder and Fire Raping the Sky
Lustfilled Desire The Weak Ones must Die
Warriors of Death shall Rise Tonight
Coming to Kill the Morninglight
Nowhere to Hide your Time has Come
A Vengeance for Them and a Feast to Some
The Eve of Destruction - Hellfire Flames
Raping the women the Sacrifice has to be Done
Metal to Metal - A Yearning for Blood
The Gallow is Ready the Traitor is Going to Die
Fight till Death with Hate
We End your Life and You will Die in Pain
No more Life in Sight
The Victory is Won by the Legions of the Night
