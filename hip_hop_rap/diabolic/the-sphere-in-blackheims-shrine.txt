Threehundred and Six Years after his Death
Strangers From the Distant West Explored the Crypts
Buried for Years under Silent Stone
They Beheld a Netherworld never Seen in a Mortals Eye
A Place meant to be Unentered for Eternity
Here where the Days were Nights and the Nights were Magic Nights
Great Grandious Legends had their throne in these Shadowhalls
Once there were Spirits Lurking like Serpent Tounges
Mist and Dust were now the Kings in this Deathsleep Cavern
The Strangers Hungry Eyes Caught the Portal to the Shrine
Unlocked the Hidden Wrath of Dimensional Deathworlds
The Crypts Descended deeply Down to Ashes under Ground
But the Sphere Raged over Landscapes towards a Castle unknown...
