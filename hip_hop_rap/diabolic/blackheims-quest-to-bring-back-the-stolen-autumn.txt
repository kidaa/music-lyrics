Once upon a Time in a Medieval Legendary World
In late December Cold of the Thousand Winter Season
Blackheim took Farewell of his Crypts in the Forestrealms
and Rode into the Horizonland Unreachable for Mortals
The Mighty Skies turned into a Colour of Blackest Midnight
Still the Winds knew where to Travel on a Forthblown Path
He Passed the Chasm so Below and the Home of Aurora Borealis
He would soon be Facing the Lurkers of Time - Life - Death
Blackheim's Quest to Bring back the Stolen Autumn
He exchanged his Sentinel Soul for a Serpent Sleeping in his Heart
and so September Appeared on Wings and was Brought back to his Land...
He exchanged his Sentinel Blood for Dragon's Breath Raging in his Lungs
and so October Appeared on Wings and was Brought back to his Land...
He exchanged his Sentinel Wisdom for Ashes Buried in his Eyes
and so November Appeared on Wings and was Brought back to his Land...
Blackheim finally Asked for December since the Sentinels of Life and Death
did not Know it was the month of Winter...
The Lurker of Time Cried out Blackheims Fooling Strategem
But the Sentinel was at one with Lightning
and Threw the Serpent into the Mouth of Time
Blew the Dragon's Breath with the Strength of a Demon
into the Eyes of Life the Lurker
Spread the Ashes in the Shadows of Death
and the Curse Dissolved with their Departure
Deathlike was the Century in this Horizonland oh so far Away
Cold and Blackened with no Sounds of Rejoice
Now He Held the Triumph High in Heart
Stormed over Fields with Might in Hand
