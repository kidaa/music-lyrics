Death Takes m all...
I am the Hater!
The Sin of God, the Whore of Life
I am the Will who Kill for the Bloody Sake of Death
I am the Hater!
The Fear, the Lies, the Painful Cries
I am the Blade which Slits a Throat to End another Breath
I Bring terrible Demise
Spill Misery over their Lives
I Make sure Evil will Rise
To End more Meaningful Lives
I am the Hater
The Tormentor
An Eye for an Eye
Everyone fucking Die
