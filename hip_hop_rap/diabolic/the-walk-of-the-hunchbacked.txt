First verses are real chantings - not to be published
Shadows - Trapped in a Coffin of Death
Demons - Flying with Wings of the Night
Ravens - Lifting their Claws to the Sky
This is the Winter of an Eternal Season of Doom
I still Rule the Skylines beyond the Lunar Forestral Room
Scrolls of Ancient Wisdom Carved under Fields of Bloom
Empire of the Deathstarved Raging the Battle so Far
Sunless Days of Years
Sunburnt Eyes of all Fears
