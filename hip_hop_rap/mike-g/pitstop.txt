It's not easy to live in this crazy life
There're so many problems,
So many things to care about
School, work, I can't even think about it
We all need a Pitstop!

To Rest...

Pitstop, we all need some time to rest
Pitstop, some time to clean our minds
Pitstop, to recover our energy
Pitstop, sooner or later you'll get yours

Everyday we get more problems
Life it seems to be our enemy
Forget everything that bothers you
We all need a Pitstop!

To think about our acts
The things we have done
The way we treat each other
The future we'll get
