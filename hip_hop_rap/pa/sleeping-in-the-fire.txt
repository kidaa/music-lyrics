Touch...
Touching the flame's designs
Feeling the flame's denial
And your finger's in the fire

Look...
Looking at the candle light
Seeing the flame of life
In my sparely lite twilight

Taste the love
That loosens and magic
And makes you numb
The passion and all
The pain in one
You're sleeping in the fire
Taste the love
That loosens this magic
And makes you numb
You feel all you've done
You've done for love
You're sleeping in the fire
A gaze at the flaming fire
And cry out the name of which I hurtOh...

Taste the love
That loosens and magic
And makes you numb
The passion and all
The pain in one
You're sleeping in the fire
Taste the love
That loosens this magic
And makes you numb
You feel all you've done
You've done for love
You're sleeping in the fire
Taste the love
That loosens and magic
And makes you numb
The passion and all
The pain in one
You're sleeping in the fire
