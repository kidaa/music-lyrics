Blackie Lawless
There's never a day, that's passing my way
That I never need it
My hands on the wheel, my foot's on the steel
Cause I gotta feel it

The rock rolls forever on - ooh forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh it's coming down
The rock rolls forever on - ooh forever
Like thunder - coming down, aah yeah

It blows through my veins, like thunder and rain
And I can't live without it
I scream for the crowds, and turn it up loud
Cause I gotta shout it

The rock rolls forever on - ooh forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh it's coming down, aah yeah
The rock rolls forever on - ooh forever
Like thunder - coming down

Six string and lightning strikes
Come make me blind
Aah burn it up
Bring down the pedal to the metal
Just one more time
Aah turn it up

The rock rolls forever on - ooh forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh it's coming down
The rock rolls forever on - ooh forever
Like thunder - coming down

Forever never stop
Forever never stop
Forever never stop
Forever never stop
