Uuuh uuuh uuuh
Mmmmm

I was alone until you came,
But I knew something was about to change,
'Cause I'm no longer feeling lonely,
And it's all 'cause of you,
It's this feeling that I'm getting,
Like a dream come true.

When you smile at me,
You don't know how much it means,
'Cause I can see your heart
You fit right into my dreams,
When you smile at me, oh oh oh
When you smile at me,
I feel like there's a difference anyway.

Yeah yeaaah
And I feel like there's a difference anyway.

Now take my life and all the fame, take it all, take it all
And let them come at take it all away, it don't matter to me
'Cause I've been all around the world, yeah, can't compare
It can't compare to you,
And this feeling that I'm getting,
When I'm looking at you.

When you smile at me, when you smile at me
You don't know how much it means,
'Cause I can see your heart
You fit right into my dreams,
When you smile at me, when you smile at me oh oh oh oh
When you smile at me,
I feel like there's a difference anyway.

Oh oh oh ooh oh yeah
I feel like there's a difference anyway.
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oooh oh

You lift me up when I feel down,
Anytime that you're around,
I don't want nobody but you,
When my days are dark and blue,
I want you for my friend,
I will be there to the end,
All I need is one look at you.

When you smile at me, when you smile at me
You don't know how much it means,
'Cause I can see your heart
You fit right into my dreams, in my dreams
When you smile at me, oh oh oh oh when you smile at me
When you smile at me,
I feel like there's a difference anyway

Oh oh
When you smile at me oh oh oh oh
When you smile at me
When you smile at me I feel a difference in me
When you smile at me
When you smile at me smile at me
When you smile at me I feel a difference in me

When you smile at me, when you smile at me
You don't know how much it means,
'Cause I can see your heart
You fit right into my dreams,
When you smile at me, oh oh oh oh when you smile at me
When you smile at me,
I feel like there's a difference anyway.
