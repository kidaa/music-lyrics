2:51
When the truth is found to be lies
You know the joy within you dies

Don't you want somebody to love ?
Don't you want somebody to love ?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love ?
You better find someone to love

Find somebody to love

Find somebody to loveFind somebody to love

When the dawn is rose they are dead,
Yes, and you're mine, you're so full of red

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his,
Yeah, but in your head, baby,
I'm afraid you don't know
Where it is.

Tears are running,
Running along down your breast
And your friends, baby,
They treat you lik a guest.
