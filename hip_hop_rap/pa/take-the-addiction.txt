Show me the nerves twitching on your face
Killing the flesh on the bone
You're just one final scream away
You love it to death ya know

Tell me ya lie on your bed of nails
Tell me you're losing control
Nightmares in ecstacy ya need
A razorlike crown of thorns

Hey, hey, yeah take the addiction
Hey, hey, yeah just a little, It's just one pretty kill away
Hey, hey, yeah kiss the affliction
Oh a pretty kill away, a kill away tonight

Screaming babies on razor blades
Into the hole you slide
Barbed-wire and twisting snakes
In a bed of nails you die

Hey, hey, yeah take the addiction
Hey, hey, yeah just a little, It's just one pretty kill away
Hey, hey, yeah kiss the affliction
Oh a pretty kill away, a kill away tonight
