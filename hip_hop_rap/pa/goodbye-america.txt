I'm politcally  incorrect
And damn proud of it
I love my country,
But I'm scared to death of it's government
Ya believe what you read,
Cause it's all that we give ya
Coz all of history is written by winners
I'm engaged in a frenzy
Of mass self-destruction
I feed upon your famine to fuel my corruption
I'm wholeselling hatred
And international incest

To carnivorous hyenas in a global theft feast
I've mastered the arts of death
And foreign nations genocide
And those who turn on me
Commit national suicide

I'm the queen of the global dream
And I rule a declining nation
I sit and watch all the violent screams
From the throne of your desperation
I killed them all and I stole their land
Enslaved the blacks and slaughtered the red man
In god we trusted and I gave birth
To would be kings to rule the earthI have more pigs than I have tits to feed
I embrace the world's phoney leaders
And hold the sucklings to my breast
And I'd fool ya all as I'd feed ya
I'll prop ya up,  then strike ya down
And lick your blood up from your ground
Humpty-fuckin'-dumpty
My empire's falling down

Breakdown goodbye America
So long the music's died
Freedom last hero's wasted
I made you, I'll break you
Breakdown goodbye America
It's all gone, kiss it goodbye
There on bloody bended knee's where
My nation died
