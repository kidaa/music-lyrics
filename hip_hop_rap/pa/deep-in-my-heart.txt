Ooooh ooooh

Here we are
The two of us together
I feel it in my heart 
We can change the world forever
If you want me too 
I'll be there for you 
Just remember

Deep in my heart 
A valley so true 
I wanna know 
Where to start 
And baby
Deep in my heart 
There are miracles too 
Just let me know 
How to start 
Deep in your heart

Like a falling star 
That shines in stormy weathers
I'll be where you are 
As long as we're together
I will trust in you 
Though your days are blue 
Just remember

Deep in my heart 
A valley so true 
I wanna know 
Where to start 
And baby 
Deep in my heart 
There are miracles too
Just let me know 
How to start 
Deep in your heart

Uuuuh uuuuh uuuh

Deep in my heart 
A valley so true 
I wanna know I wanna know
Where to start 
And baby

Deep in my heart it's true
I will follow you
Deep in my heart it's true
I will be there for you

Deep in my heart it's true
I will follow you
Deep in my heart it's true

Deep in my heart 
A valley so true 
I wanna know 
Where to start 
Deep in my heart
