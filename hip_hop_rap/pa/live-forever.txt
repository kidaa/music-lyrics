Since I met you baby 
We've been connected someway 
We don't tell each other why 
I just look into your eyes 
And see a new day coming 
You must be blessed with something 
I'm so happy I could cry 
'Till we enter paradise

We'll live forever 
That's my belief in you and I 
We'll stick together

We'll live forever 
That's my belief in you and I 
We'll stick together we're gonna live forever

La la la forever uuuh
Na na na na na na na na

Until the end of all time 
I'm gonna be by your side 
We don't need a second try 
I just know within my mind 
I feel the world is turning 
Deep in my heart I'm burning 
I'm so happy I could cry 
'Till we enter paradise

We'll live forever forever
That's my belief in you and I 
We'll stick together stick together

We'll live forever forever
That's my belief in you and I 
We'll stick together stick together
