Blackie Lawless
He came from the East
They called him a beast
This king of terror insane
Neutron Ronnie, the people would whisper his name
Dangerous and mad
A torch in his hand
Spread fire by the light of the moon
Ooh, pyrotechnical wizard of doom

Oh no here comes Ronnie
Ah the boy with the flame
All his life has been burning inside
Oh no no here comes Ronnie
Ah the bombers insane
Ah till he dies it'll burn in his eyes

A phantom so cool
At midnight would rule
And molotov cocktail would rain
Babies screamin'
And house would go up in flames
When next Ronnie goes, nobody knows
But inside him's where Lucifer hides
Ooh, he's the boy with the bombs at his sideOoh no here comes Ronnie
Ah the boy with the flame
Ah his life has been burning inside
Oh no no here comes Ronnie
Ah the bombers insane
Ah till he dies it'll burn in his eyes

Oh no here comes Ronnie
Ah the boy with the flame
Ah his life has been burning inside
Oh no no here comes Ronnie
Ah the bombers insane
Ah till he dies it'll burn in his eyes
