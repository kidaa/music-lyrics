Romeo and Juliet

In the summertime I met a guy 
He was so fine,
He blew my mind

My friends are telling me 
Girl he's a looser 
But they can't see

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet 
It feels like 
Something's happening to me

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet 
It feels like 
Something's happening to me

Romeo and Juliet

Romeo and Juliet

Romeo and Juliet

Hallo

From the first time I saw his eyes 
There was sunshine 
Every time

He walks into the room 
I feel my heart go boom boom boom

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet 
It feels like
Something's happening to me

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet 
It feels like
Something's happening to me

Romeo and Juliet

Romeo and Juliet

Romeo and Juliet

There was a time, when I was young 
And love it felt so strong
Now it comes back to me 
What's going on?

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet 
It feels like 
Something's happening to me

It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet 
It feels like 
Something's happening to me
