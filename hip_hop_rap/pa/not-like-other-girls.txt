I am not like other girls
I don't breathe for Sundays 
I want you here and in my arms 
I can't just smile and turn away

I am not like other girls
I don't breathe for Sundays 
I want you here and in my arms 
I can't just smile and turn away

I have prayed from a distance 
Since you've been out of my reach 
I can't hold on to reason 
And practice what I preach 
In my dreams we're together 
There is no one else in my heart 
Love is stronger than leather 
You should have known right from the start

I am not like other girls
I don't breathe for Sundays
I want you here and in my arms
I can't just smile and turn away

I am not like other girls
I don't breathe for Sundays
I want you here and in my arms
I can't just smile and turn away

I have made my decision
I will give into your kiss 
I can't hide my emotions 
Pretend you don't exist
In all my dreams we're together 
And I can't get you out of my head 
My love it floats like a feather 
But it falls if you forget

I am not like other girls 
I don't breathe for Sundays 
I want you here and in my arms 
I can't just smile and turn away

I am not like other girls 
I don't breathe for Sundays 
I want you here and in my arms 
I can't just smile and turn away

Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Come with me tonight

Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Come with me tonight

I am not like other girls I'm not your ordinary girl
I don't breathe for Sundays I'm not part of that society
I want you here and in my arms send me diamonds and pearls
I can't just smile and turn away that aint doing it for me

I am not like other girls I'm not your ordinary girl
I don't breathe for Sundays I'm not part of that society
I want you here and in my arms send me diamonds and pearls
I can't just smile and turn away that aint doing it for me

I am not like other girls 
I don't breathe for Sundays 
I want you here and in my arms 
I can't just smile and turn away

I am not like other girls I'm not your ordinary girl
I don't breathe for Sundays I'm not part of that society
I want you here and in my arms send me diamonds and pearls
I can't just smile and turn away that aint doing it for me
