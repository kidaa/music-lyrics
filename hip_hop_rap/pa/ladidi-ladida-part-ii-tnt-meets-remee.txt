I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you S.O.A.P.

Baby u can touch my
If I can get a taste of your
But you only seem to care for money
And I don't wanna wait a minute more

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you S.O.A.P. oh oh oh oh

Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida
Ladidi ladida

Baby you can drive my
And maybe I could ride your
But there's too many girls in your jacuzzi
And you'll never get a piece of my

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you S.O.A.P. oh oh oh oh

If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it
If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it
If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it
I wanna see you come
If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it
If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it
I wanna see you come
If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it
If you don't give it up I'll swear I'm gonna stop it

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some
Ladidi ladida
I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you S.O.A.P. oh oh oh oh
