[Ginuwine] Ooooh oooooo oooooh!!!
[P. Diddy] Yeah, this that bounce right here
[Ginuwine] Come On Now!!!
[P. Diddy] Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now straight to the top now

[Ginuwine & Mario Winans]
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again
Go 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mommy make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

[Chorus: Ginuwine, Mario Winans & P. Diddy]
What I need
[P. Diddy:] Yeah take that
Is a pretty woman next to me
[Ginuwine:] A pretty woman yeah baby
To share the dreams that I Believe
[P. Diddy:] Dream with me, believe in me
Maybe we could start a family
[Ginuwine:] Start a family baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon]
Listen to me now what should I say now Come on ma
Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened alot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin Sean bless it
So why listen to her and start guessin
Mommy you ain't ready to ride to start dressin
I need a girl receive my mom's blessin
Confession, my love no contestin
I need affection

[P. Diddy] Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!

[Mario Winans]
Girl what the hell is on your mind
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's somethin leakin in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me, always did agree
That ain't what I need, baby!!!

[Ginuwine & Mario Winans]
What I need,is a pretty woman next to me
[Mario Winans:] Oh please baby
To share the dreams that I Believe
[Mario Winans:] I need a girl in my life
Maybe we could start a family
[Ginuwine:] Start a family baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Ay yo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever bee to Sandro Pe
Or seened a brotha play Amando Lay
Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin, do I believe in
Love you till the day I stop breathin, I love you girl

[Chorus: Ginuwine & Mario Winans]
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me
[Ginuwine:] Standin next to me girl
To share the dreams that I Believe
[Ginuwine:] When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
[Ginuwine:] I wanna see your pretty face, yeah
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need
[Female singer:] Is that all you want
Is a pretty woman next to me
[Female singer:] Made the sacrifice
To share the dreams that I believe
[Female singer:] And maybe maybe we
Maybe we could start a family
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need, is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I Believe
Maybe we could start a family
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need
