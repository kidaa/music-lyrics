Hell hound!
Hot leather on your legs,
They're smoking power kegs
Your ranting on means
It's hell bound!

And you're the one they claim
Is going down in flames
You're acting in Hades grave

Hellion! The devil's hellion in town
Hellion! We'll never have to die!
Well, child,
You're sweating and you're stoned
They've got to knock you down
Makes you crazy all night!

You're in never ending pain
And drink the devil's rain
You're screaming out your nameHellion! The devil's hellion in town
Hellion! We'll never have to die!

The Gods you worship are steel
At the altar of rock and roll
You kneel,
A slave who forever rocks
His tail in the devil's locks
A slave like the bloody exile

Hellion! The devil's hellion in town
Hellion! We'll never have to die!
