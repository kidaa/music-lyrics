Come on boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, gotta get her outta there,
Come on boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, mama says it just ain't fair.

One night mama when to fetch herself a sweet potato fell down the cellar stairs,
Stork dropped on it while she was on the floor, so my sister was born down there.
Daddy says this one will be nothing but a misery, never will be worth a damn..
But mama just loved her little sweet potato baby, with a face like a par boiled yam..

Come on boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, gotta get her outta there,
Come on boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, mama says it just ain't fair.

Potato grew up to be as pretty as a peach, with her hair in honey curls,
Went to the apple cider ball at the armory with all the other Recordmany girls,
Sheriff came by, picked potato from the polka, but she turned him with a fiddle de-de,
And before she could turn around and find another partner, sheriff took her into custody,

Come on boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, gotta get her outta there,
Come on boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, mama says it just ain't fair.

Mama and daddy put together quite a little posse countin' me and Jack and cousin Will,
We all jumped in to the old Chevy pick-up and we caught 'em at the top of the hill,
Daddy took his Remington and shot away the lock, for to set his little darlin' free,
But Potato said Daddy shut the gawd darn door, sheriff wants to marry me

Let's go boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, guess we better leave her there,
Let's go boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, mama says it's more than fair,
Let's go boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, guess we better leave her there,
Let's go boys, Potato's in the paddy wagon, mama says it's more than fair,
Mama says it's more than fair
Mama says it's more.than fair!
