Give me a ticket on a jet airplane!
I'm a going to take it up!

I wanna be somebodyI lead my life in the fast lane
The only way to make it
It might keep me going all night long
Cause that's the way I like it
And with what you've got
In the heat of the night
I know we've got to try it
Until the flame burns out!
Until the flame burns out!
So turn it up,
Your radio
Everybody shake it
I'm a 100 degrees
With wild fantasies
And I need someone to make it
Out!
Show Me a place where love is sweet
I ain't going to take it
I need a girl
Who just wants my love
Cause now is the time to make it
Before the flame burns out!
Before the flame burns out!
Before the flame burns out!
Before the flame burns out!
Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!
I'm gonna make
Your hips on fire
It's so hot, I've got to try it
Show me the spot
And I'll hit the mark
Baby, I've got the gasoline
if you've got the spark
Yeah, before the flame burns out!
Until the flame burns out!
