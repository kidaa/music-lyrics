3:45
You don't have to hear my heart beat
All you need is to look into my eyes
All tell me, I'm the one your heart needs
I'm the only one you run to in the night
Oh- let me, burn the words forever mine
Across your heart, across your mind

Take your hands and feel my heart beat
Come and let me feel it in your eyes
All you have to do is touch me
Oh - And lay your flame across my fire
Oh - Let me spread your wings and come inside
And take your heart and make you mineCome and lay down your heart on me
All that I wanna feel is
Breathe in me
Lay down your heart on me
Feel you inside of me
Breathe on me
Come and take me on, take me down
Oh, take me all, all the way
There's only one way
Only one thing I need, all I need
Take me way down
Come and lay down on me
