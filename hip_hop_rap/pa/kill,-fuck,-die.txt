All my friends are hellions
They got nine toes in their graves
We all live to thrill ourselves
But got twice the will to die
Oh yeah

Ya wanna live
Wanna die
Wanna cry
An angry noise
Ya wanna kill
Ya wanna thrill
Ya wanna yell
An angry noise

Kill, Fuck, Die
All ya get from life's
Kill, Fuck, Die
Yeah you're gonna die
Kill, Fuck, Die
All ya get from life's
Kill, Fuck, DieNo ya won't take it
No ya can't take it
No ya won't take the pain from me
No ya won't take it
No ya can't take it
No ya won't take the pain away from me

I am pissed and violent
Someday you'll understand
I'm living to thrill myself  like
The animal I know I am

You're gonna kneel before ya die
You're gonna kneel to crucify
You're gonna, gonna kneel before you die
You're gonna kneel to crucify
