I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you S.O.A.P.

Baby u can touch my
If I can get a taste of your
But you only seem to care for money
And I don't wanna wait a minute more can't buy my love

If you don't give it up
I swear I'm gonna stop it,
Cause I'm never gonna spend it on you

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some

And maybe I could ride your
But there's too many girls in your jacuzzi
And you'll never get a piece of my don't play my love

If you don't give it up
I swear I'm gonna stop it,
Cause I'm never gonna spend it on you

I wanna see you come
Into my life
Before I give you some

Before I give you S.O.A.P. oh oh oh oh
