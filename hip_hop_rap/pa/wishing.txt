Since you ran away
I've been beside myself in every way
Trying hard to get you off my mind
I know that we agreed
It would be cool to take some time away
Now the reason's just to hard to find

I can't stop crying
I can't sleep thinking of you

Wishing that I wasn't alone
can you hear me?
Wishing that I wasn't alone
Oooh oh

Wishing that I wasn't alone
can you hear me?
Wishing that I wasn't alone
Oooh yeah

Something strange has happened to me lately
Baby can't you see
Something that my eyes wont let me hide
Nothing seems to get to me
In other peoples company
Wishing I could leave them all behind

I can't stop crying
I can't sleep thinking of you

Wishing that I wasn't alone
can you hear me?
Wishing that I wasn't alone
Oooh oh

Wishing that I wasn't alone
can you hear me?
Wishing that I wasn't alone
Oooh yeah

Aaaah

I can't stop crying
I can't sleep thinking of you
Wishing that I wasn't alone
can you hear me?
Wishing that I wasn't alone
Oooh oh

Wishing that I wasn't alone
can you hear me?
Wishing that I wasn't alone
Oooh yeah
