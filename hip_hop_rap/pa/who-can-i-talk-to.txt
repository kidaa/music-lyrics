Ah ah ah aaaah aaah aaah

I don't know what to do
Cause I've been missing you 
And since you ran away
I feel like all my world is coming down 
I don't know what to do 
I made a fool of you 
And now the only thing 
That's written in my mind is coming down

Coming down 
Coming down
I've missed you baby

Who can I talk to, 
When you're not there?
Who can I talk to? 
Who can I talk to?
I wanna touch you 
But you're not there 
Who can I talk to?

I don't know what to do 
I'm feeling sad and blue 
Sometimes I wish 
I never met you and I'm trying to forget 
It should be easy to 
That's what I used to do 
But things are changing 
Rearranging every little thing you said

Things you said
In my head 
The things you said 
Spins in my head

Who can I talk to,
When you're not there? 
Who can I talk to? 
Who can I talk to?
I wanna touch you 
But you're not there 
Who can I talk to?
Who can I talk to,
When you're not there? 
Who can I talk to? 
Who can I talk to?
I wanna touch you 
But you're not there 
Who can I talk to?

I still remember when 
I got the chills from the eyes that you sent
I still long for the time we spent 
Nights like lovers days like friends 
Used to think it would never end
Girls like you turn boys to men 
Should have known that I was blessed 
When your hair was upon my chest

Who can I talk to,
When you're not there?
Who can I talk to?
Who can I talk to?
I wanna touch you
But you're not there
Who can I talk to?

Guess I was never meant to love you 
Never meant to love you
Never meant to love you
Guess I was never meant to love you never meant to love you
Never meant to love you never meant to love you
Never meant to love you never meant to love you
This way
