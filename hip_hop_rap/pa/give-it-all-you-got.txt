Me and my sister we were bored and feeling down,
We were listening to the radio,
When we heard somebody shout.

Can we rock for a minute,
And turn the music up?
When we get to the weekend,
We'll party 'till we drop.

Sing it

Once you get it you'll never stop, sing it girl

Back in school we used to live through magazines,
Everybody played it cool,
Sometimes it made you wanna scream.

Can we rock for a minute,
And turn the music up?
When we get to the weekend,
We'll party 'till we drop.

Sing it
