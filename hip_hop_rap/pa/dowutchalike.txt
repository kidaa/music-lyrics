I used to be the girl 
Nobody believed
Used to live inside a world 
No one ever sees 
And when the other girls
Ran around in town 
I had my only friend 
Doggin' me around

Girl you got to get yourself a rude attitude 
Why should I believe in you?

Cause you can do what you like
If you dig what you do 
Your life will be better that way
Yeah you can do what you like 
If you dig what you do 
Let nobody get in your way

Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah

I remember just how it used to be 
How bad I used to feel when they looked at me

Girl you got to be like we like 
If you wanna hang 
I won't let it happen it again

Cause you can do what you like 
If you dig what you do 
Your life will be better that way
Yeah you can do what you like
If you dig what you do 
Let nobody get in your way

Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
Do what you wanna do do what you wanna do yeah ih yeah
