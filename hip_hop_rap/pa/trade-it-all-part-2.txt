Hot storm, I'm so into you 
'Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends 
with you 
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them 
interviews
My sweet thing never believe them rumors that been 
true
In fact I had no more expence, it's true 
But you was wifey could change me into a groom 
in a mintue boo 
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you 
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you 
I wanna take you there, feel like June in December too 
So what you think about Cancun till the winter through 
I don't know whatever consumes you gonna do 
I put a daytime to go to Bloomies and spend with you 
Like any other man I will zoom to the clinic too 
Now I wanna see if me and my junior's identical 
I zoom, put a moon on the skin of you 
I swear to everything that same afternoon will 
begin to move, feel me

All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring 
All, anything to have you on my team

Come here, girl, come and take a walk with me 
So I could take you places you don't often be 
Come on, ma, come and get lost with me 
As far as them other chicks, can't get 'em off-a me 
Everlastin' love in a whole other fashion 
All I'm askin', let me cash in 
'Cause I'll give her passion, all of the Sean John

In orderly fashion perhaps when Figure it out 
excatly wat diddy about cuz we can take this whole city out 
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us 
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us 
Leer jets and choppers, love helipopers 
Separate the weak from the awesome

Yo', this new comers  known to move with the seasons 
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes 
And there for every uw, hum, and moon and make sure 
when the new hummer roams the shoes come in chrome 
I ain't  new if ain't buy white yellow and Q'cumba stones 
That send chills threw a womans bones 
But life gives groove summer lones 
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if 
a few crumbs are blown 
Flights out of few summer loans 
Now I wanna wake up every day with you in a new number zone 
Ma-Me-ya its u I'ma phone 
Just to erase all the negative view from your dome 
And I promise this Fella G 
And so case they hit comma of  jealousy 
And drama you tellin' me, so mama come yell at me 
So I could put the top down and we could cruise like 
Tom and Penelope my charm is a felony 

Chorus
Jagged Edge 
Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
