Such a wicked vicious woman, black magic voodoo queen
Lesbo nymphomaniac, ooh, she's got a girlfriend that's seventeen

She went and hijacked my brand new car
I say AC, she says DC
The damned bitch is just too bizarre

Bye bye bye

Her eyes burn the flame
Liar, the princess of pain

The hellraiser finally pushed her luck
Before I go leave her in her dust
I'm gonna fuck her till she can't stand up
