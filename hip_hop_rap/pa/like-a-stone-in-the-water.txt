When we were kids, 
Me and my sister we used to go down to the beach, 
And collect beautiful stones out of the water, 
But when we came home and got them out of our pockets, 
They would be just as gray as the stones in our drive way,
And that's when it came to my mind,
At the right place at the right time we all shine.

Come on
Like a stone

I had a dream I was a greystone on the boardwalk,
Nobody ever came my way, no no 
Then one day out of order,
I fell into the water, 
And now I know why they say, 
Miracles can happen everyday.

It doesn't matter where you're from, 
Kiss the world and take it on, 
You've got to know,
You've gotta know, 
Someday you will se the sun,
From a place where you belong,
Just like a stone in the water.

I used to look at guys,
And all the way through junior-high, junior-high
I wish I was a beauty queen, yeah yeah 
Now I look in the mirror,
And I see it clearer, 
My life is not a magazine,
But everybody is aloud to dream.

It doesn't matter where you're from, 
Kiss the world and take it on, 
You've got to know, gotta know
You've gotta know, 
Someday you will see the sun, from a place where you belong
From a place where you belong,
Just like a stone in the water.

Like a stone, 
Just like a stone in the water.

Yeah
You can tell by one look in my direction,
That there is no perfection, 
And that makes us what we are, what we are
Your success is made from your decision, 
Baby baby listen, 
The question is where you are where you are 
Everyone can be a superstar.

It doesn't matter where you're from, where you're from
Kiss the world and take it on, 
You've got to know, you gotta know, you gotta know
You've gotta know, 
Someday you will see the sun, someday you will see
From a place where you belong, you belong
Just like a stone in the water just like a stone.

It doesn't matter where you're from, doesn't matter
Kiss the world and take it on, kiss the world, kiss the world, kiss the world, 
kiss the world
You've got to know,
You've gotta know, 
Someday you will see the sun, from a place where you belong
From a place where you belong, you belong
Just like a stone in the water.

Like a stone
In the water
Like a stone in the water, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Like a stone in the water, yeah

It doesn't matter where you're from, 
Kiss the world and take it on now 
Like a stone in the water, yeah come on.

It doesn't matter where you're from, doesn't matter
Kiss the world and take it on now kiss the world, kiss the world, kiss the 
world, kiss the world
You've got to know,
You've gotta know
Someday you will see the sun, someday you will see
From a place where you belong,

It doesn't matter where you're from, like a stone
Kiss the world and take it on like a stone
You've got to know, you gotta know, you gotta know
