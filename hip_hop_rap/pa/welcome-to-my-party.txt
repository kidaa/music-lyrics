Welcome to the place we're born and raised,
Taking you back to the homebase,
Where we first started until we got it, 
This is the city were we first charted,
And it's not about fly gear,
About the money you make, about the clothes you wear,
it's all about how you feel it,
If you can keep it real.

So get ya groove on,
And dance all night,
This is your song, 
We'll do this right tonight,

Our prince he date girls who sing,
Once we get started, we can't stop,
