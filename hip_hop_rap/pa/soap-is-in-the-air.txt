Soap is in the air 
Feel it everywhere
There is magic in the air
All around
Just when you need it

Soap is in the air
Feel it everywhere
There is magic in the air aha aha
Come come
Soap is in the air tonight

Here's another round,
Blowing up and smiling down
When you hear the sound,
Put your feet back on the ground
Soap is in the air,
Freaky people everywhere
People they stop and stare,
But we really don't care
We're ladi dadi,
This is how we party
If a friend's in trouble, baby we can do karate

So get your hands up come on get your hands up
See the club packed, wanna get it all back

Soap is in the air
Feel it every where
There is magic in the air
All around
Just when you need it

Soap is in the air
Feel it every where
There is magic in the air aha aha
Come come
Soap is in the air tonight

Aha aha
S.O.A.P. is in the air
Aha aha

Simon and Lisa they went from here to Ibiza
We took a Coke and a pizza,
And we were so glad to meet ya
We got to rock your body,
Come and go banani
Even though we play the game you get no pupunani
20 years young
Shootin' like a shotgun 
If you can't have fun,
Boy you better run run

So get your hands up, come on get your hands up
See the club packed
On a fast track

Soap is in the air
Feel it everywhere
There is magic in the air
All around
Just when you need it

Soap is in the air the air
Feel it everywhere S.O.A.P. is in the air
There is magic in the air I feel it everywhere aha aha
Come come
Soap is in the air

Back to life, back back to the dawn
Back to this feeling that is gone
Back where there's nothing left to hide
Back to life

Back to life, back back to the dawn
Back to this feeling that is gone
Back where there's nothing left to hide
I wanna come Back to life

Soap is in the air
Feel it everywhere
There is magic in the air
All around
Just when you need it

Soap is in the air in the air
Feel it everywhere S.O.A.P. is in the air
There is magic in the air I can feel it everywhere aha aha
