Money makes me crazy
Money makes me insane
Diamonds, silver, gold, and precious steel
I want it all It's mine to claim
I hold my hands out, I take it all

I want a fistful, fistful of diamonds
I live for the glory and fame
I want a fistful, fistful of diamonds
The millions are calling my name

Fortune come here to me, it's power that rules the game
Seduction of silver and lawless greed
I love it all, I damn the shame
The root of all evil can hear me callI want a fistful, fistful of diamonds
I live for the glory and fame
I want a fistful, fistful of diamonds
The millions are calling my name

Solitaire, come cast a spell of magic
The smell of green I stack my dollars high
Intoxicating, my mind's wreaking havoc
A famous face, I get what you can't buy

I want a fistful, fistful of diamonds
I live for the glory and fame
I want a fistful, fistful of diamonds
The millions are calling my name
