Blackie Lawless and Chris Holmes
So you wanna know what's going on
When we get wild, and we're up until dawn
The parties and the stories, they're all true
Ain't nothing left when we're through
One distant land where it's all sin and sand

King of Sodom, I want the flesh
Gotta have it, I love it to death
King of Sodom, I eat'em alive
Like a Savage, the strong will survive

Wicked souls, a hunger for lust
You lay it down, we're going for bust
We live a life, that's hell on wheels
You don't know how it feels
Ride the wind, and soon you'll all be inSodom and Gomorrah - ooh, sweet Gomorrah
We're the present tribe - the present tribe
Children of the fire - of the fire
Burning up alive, alive, alive, alive

King of Sodom, I want the flesh
Gotta have it, I love it to death
King of Sodom, I eat'em alive
Like a Savage, the strong will survive

King of Sodom, I want the flesh
Gotta have it, I love it to death
King of Sodom, I eat'em alive
Like a Savage, the strong will survive
