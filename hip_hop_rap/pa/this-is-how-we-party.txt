This is how we party
Fooling with your body
Come on everybody
Can't get enough of you

This is how we party
Fooling with your body
Come on everybody
Can't get enough of you

Here we are back in the game
Raise your hands and feel the rain
Got one thing we've got to try
Makin' many money makin' big boys cry
To bad that he's a liar
She's so cool but her hair is on fire
Letting it go make it feel strong
We're gonna set it off 'till the break of dawn

This is how we do it when somebody wanna turn you down
You got to keep on movin'
Don't let nobody get you hit you get you down to the ground
Hear when we say

This is how we party
Fooling with your body
Come on everybody
Can't get enough of you

This is how we party
Fooling with your body
Come on everybody
Can't get enough of you

So come on everybody we can get it together
The sun will shine in any kind of weather
Just stop trippin?and change your feel
We come to party when we come around here
Lisa lives she never lies
Simon says no time to cry
Doing what we like
We can do it all night, baby

This is how we do it when somebody wanna turn you down
You got to keep on movin'
Don't let nobody get you hit you get you down to the ground
Hear when we say

This is how we party
Fooling with your body
Come on everybody
Can't get enough of you

This is how we party
Fooling with your body
Come on everybody
Can't get enough of you
