Bang, bang, banging in your head
You're banging on the wall
Hand, hand, handing up yourself
You're handing by your balls

And you...
You die but no one hears
Or cares!
And hope's the rope that keeps you
Tied in knots

The torture never stops!
The torture never stops!
Suck, suck, sucking out the life
Your master sucks the juice
Shoot, shoot, shooting at you
And the handman's noose is loose

And you...
You cry but no one hears
Or cares
And hope's the rope that
Keeps you tied in knotsThe torture never stops!
The torture never stops!

Your master blends you dead
Still you're running back for more
And every day
You lie down for further more

The torture never stops!
The torture never stops!
