Aaah aaah aaah aaah aah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aah
Aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

I still remember the day that you came on to me,
And for the first time I saw somebody for me,
And I never really saw it,
Was all a game you played.

You took advantage of me,
Like I was some kind of fool,
Like I was ready to live my live by your rules,
You had me wrapped round your finger,
And I let it linger on.

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long,
I wanna be free to be who I want,
And show I can make it on my own.

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long,
I wanna be free to do what I want,
And show I can make it on my own,
I wanna go back.

You said that I would be back,
You said it wouldn't be long,
I had to proof to myself,
That I could be strong,
You had a hold on my senses,
But now I'm breaking free

Ooh I wanna go back to being alone, to being alone
I wanna go dancin' all night long, yeah
I wanna be free to be who I want, to be who I want
And show I can make it on my own.

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long,
I wanna be free to do what I want, wanna be free
And show I can make it on my own.

Now you don't know nothing about love,
'Cause you had the best of the best boy,
And this time baby I ain't gonna let ya
Back in my heart again.

Aaah aaah aaah aaah aah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aah
Aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Aaah aaah aaah aaah aah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aah
Aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long, dancin' all night long
I wanna be free to be who I want, wanna be free
And show I can make it on my own.

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long,
I wanna be free to do what I want,
And show I can make it on my own.

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long, oh dancin'
I wanna be free to be who I want,
And show I can make it on my own.

Now I wanna go back to being alone,
I wanna go dancin' all night long, oh dancin'
I wanna be free to do what I want,
And show I can make it on my own.

I wanna go back.
