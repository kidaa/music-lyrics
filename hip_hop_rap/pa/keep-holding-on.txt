Your sad eyes, never told me
No paradise, here for the lonely
But I hold on, half a heart here in my hands
Been so long, would you know me
Who's holding you, who's gonna hold me
If you want me, then I'll be your man

And I keep holding on
Holding on till you come back to me
And I keep holding on
Holding on till you run to me
Can you take me to heaven
Show me the way, cause I'm no angel
I am lost and
Can I hold you one more time
I guess me holding you was holding you downWill I have your memory
Or will your memory have me
I don't know, only time
Knows if I'll ever know peace of mine
Only time knows if you're mine, knows if you're
Mine

And I keep holding on
Holding on till you come back to me
And I keep holding on
Holding on till you run to me
All I can hold is a shadow of a heart that's gone
And left me shattered
I'm lost and
Can I hold you one more time
I guess me holding you
Was holding you down
I guess me holding you
Was holding you down
I guess me holding you
Was holding you down
