For all the deepest thoughts compiled,
philosophy to laws of physics,
no one's ever heard or seen,
a more beautiful thing,
than this love that saved us.

Chorus:
In the soundless awe and wonder,
words fall short to hope again.
How beautiful,
how vast your love is,
new forever,
world without an end.

The very spark that burns the stars,
drew near to me today,
the God of everything that is,
whispered in my ear that His love is boundless.
