[Layzie]
Bone Enterpri$e in the house
And just left tha liquor store
So nigga, anything goes
'Cause we on a mission for the 4 Bs:
Bank, bud, brew, and bitches, muthafuckas! 

[Wish]
I'm getting repaid
You're hittin the ground from the sound of buckshots
Well, what do you know
I'm hitting the flow and pushin' me down is two cops
I'm back on the block and sellin' my rocks
But niggas gettin' jealous
They gave me a brew, and hit me for two
I'm callin up my fellas

[Bizzy]
Well it's the ruthless nigga gangsta
Comin' out with the message to jealous muthafuckas
Straight on my dick and bitin' lyrics
Who is that perpetratin' and takin' our lyrics
Non-originatin' slobs
You wait 'til they album comes out

[Boogie Nite]
Straight from the city where thieves dwell
Thugs, gangstas, and bitches sell
The place you would journey is not a myth
[Krayzie:] yeah, muthafucka!
But Cleveland is up in this bitch! 

[Krayzie]
Now Krayzie Bone is rippin' and stickin'
Them niggas up in the nine-two
And all these niggas steppin' must got static with my crew
Well, nigga bring it on
Send them chromes to your dome
Krayzie Bone ain't no ho; I gets mine in the nine-O

[Layzie]
It's the #1 Assassin
Just be quick to put that ass out
Chillin' with Bizzy, and Krayzie, and Wish
Drinkin' 'til we pass out
Bone Enterpri$e, the gangstas niggas be pimpin' hoes
Livin' like criminals, untouchable niggeros

[Bizzy]
Hell muthafuckin' yeah!
So now you know: Bone Enterpri$e is up in this bitch!
And for the people who didn't think we was comin' out:
Nigga, you bought it! 

[Krayzie]
Yeah, Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone
Bizzy Bone, and Wish Bone in the muthafuckin' house
[Bizzy:]  Boogie Nite
My nigga,Boogie Nite, this muthafucka
Yo, and we bus tickets muthafucka!
Praise the twelve gauge
