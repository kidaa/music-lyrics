Nigga feel the beat in ya chest when ya leanin n swervin
Bass in ya back, you feel it, you heard it
Hand on the wheel no need to be nervous
Ride
With a g everything'll be perfect
Put it down, put it all on the surface
Dirty as we ride, it'll all be worth it
til the wheels fall off Nigga
That's the purpose
Nothin but the best cause we deserve it
They know when i'm comin, cause niggas can hear me before they can see me and they can't
Believe it cause i'm bumpin Eazy-E
And they just seen me on TV
Navigate through the streets dog
Keep it real to the beat that ain't no secret
Jump
Outta the jeep car
Run up in the liquor store hit the freezer
Grab a O, Gold, like my 4-0, my flow so cold, i gotta have some
Turn the music back up
To the maximum
Them niggas hatin on us but i laugh at em
I gotta 9 millimeter that i'll get me to the trunk
If i make it to the trunk
I'm a pop
That trunk
Yall already know comin outta the trunk is a AK who? with a 1
2 gauge what?

We back with a vengeance cause rap took a strippin without us
Let's be honest, this industry's now over crowded, forgot us
Nigga ya time up
Go back
To practice sign with your life and sign up
If niggas is lookin for hits hit swizz up, nigga he comin to find us
And we ain't hard to find
Been
Right here all the time
That bling got yall all blind
These niggas ain't raw as I
So don't make me kill ya
Don't try to battle me cause ain't none
Of you niggas skilled enough skilled enough
I'm sick of these niggas, they killin me, really they wanna be thugs
Everybody wanna roll like us, smoke
Blunts
Cause we pump off in your trunk
Them niggas get hypnotized
Run up as soon as they feel the vibe
They never been on a realer ride
