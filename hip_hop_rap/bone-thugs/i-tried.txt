[Intro Wish Bone]

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard, I tried hard...but I guess I
gotta try harder.

[Chorus Akon]

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here in sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

[Verse 1 Krayzie Bone]

First let me explain that I'm just a black man
and I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man my mind be
racin, and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet I been in and out of relationships, I'm
startin to see thats it's me where the complications at, but I'm layin back prayin that,
you can't have piece of mind of me, I thought I was right but really I'm wrong, in the end
I was to blind to see, I was in the fast lane chasin' my dream, and then it seem when the
fame and cash came they just got me going craaazy lately, lately, lately I beed so faded
tryin to erase it but I cant cuz the drama just goes greater and I been in so many
collisions from puttin shit up till later

[Chorus Akon]

I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here in sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

[Verse 2 Layzie Bone]

It's like I'm taking 5 steps forward and 10 steps back, tryin to get ahead of the game,
but I can't seem to get it on track, and I keep running away from the ones that say they
love me the most how could I create the distance when it's suppose to be close and uh, I
just don't know but I be out here fighting demons and, it's like a curse that I can't shake
this part of Cleveland and lord, would you help me? and stop this pain I keep inflicting on
my family hustlin gamblin, trickin and scammin scrambling and losing sight of what I'm
suppose to be handlin, it's hard to manage cuz everyday's a challenge and man I'm slippin
can't lose my balance I'm tryin not to panic

[Chorus Akon]

I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here in sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

[Verse 3 Wish Bone]

I see thangs won't change I'm stuck in the game as soon as I get out it keeps pullin me
back mayne got me doin' dirty dirt so used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand
how 9 to 5 work studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean hustlers ballin in force
I'm tryna make that major league so we never leave never, til' the sun came up gotta get it
nope no leavin no rush today games they play gotta go hard to get what u put in if you fall
off then it's all on you gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool

[Chorus Akon]

I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here in sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough
