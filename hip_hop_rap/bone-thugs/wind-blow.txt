[Layzie Bone]
Bone Thugs n Harmony
A yo we aint always been accepted like this till Listen to the wind blow
A nigga got dat Grammy
Open the door nigga,

Bone Thugs got a story thats similar to Mike Jones 
You can ask my homies 
Im memba back in the days they didnt want me
Now I blew up they all on me
They smiles phony 
Its hard to determine who really is rich or which of these niggas is fake
They tryna eat out of yo plate 
And you cant get a break 
Now how much can you take
For heavens sake
I cant wait they gone be 
Listening to the wind blow 

[Krayzie Bone]
Sittin back blowin on indo 
Waving wit my middle finger hangin out the window lets roll
Get yo muthafuckin hand out my pocket
Now they wanna be wit a nigga 
Feel like we partnas
Nigga we was lookin for a deal and you dodged us
Neva did call us 
Where was yo promise
But now we ridin by 
Listening to the wind blow 

[Wish Bone]
Nigga to the real to the sets
When it comes to the streets
Livin peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto 
Give all peace wont let is go
Say we wouldnt make it 
Now we some of the greatest 
Bumpin through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo

[Chorus x2]
Yo dont love me now 
And youll never love me again
You cant you cant say it
You would never 
?

[Layzie Bone]   
4 tru thugs from the double glock
A nigga ready to rumble 
When trouble nocks
2 one way tickets straight off the block
We gonna this pay 
Yall niggaz jus watch 
All eyes on me
Like my name is Pac
Fuckin hip hop clock
Gotta pass the glock
Takin drastic shots 
Till these bastards stop
When the casket drop
I be mashin out
In brand new drop top flyin nigga 
Listening to wind blow

[Krayzie Bone]
Killin them niggaz witta automatic weapon
When they step up 
they get hit up wit the AK-47
Anybody tryna git the muthafuckin blessin 
They betta not mess wit mine cuz im tellin 
Any you niggaz run up again 
That it aint no pretendin go for sin u gonna git in 
Boy you betta listen listen listen
Listening to wind blow

[Wish Bone]
If you get a change of foot
Inch for inch 
You betta do it do it
Grab the game 
Do it to it 
Chase to chase 
But still hood 
Live it or love it 
Dummies of  the rocks
Duck up out of my hood hood hood

[Chorus x2]

Murder mo murder them all [x4]

[Krayzie Bone]
? The wind blow
Never see me cuz I get ghost
So a nigga neva get close
I go fast or slow 
No matter the tempo
Murda the instrumental
Murda the rhythm 
I ride to the rhythm of murda
Its murda 
This lyrical venom I serve a
Gone kill um at minimal murda 
Nigga burn some some 
Stick wit rans dats? that cash 
Nigga you betta learn some some some
We got the hood hot lock
Even got the burbs bumpin bumpin
They probably tryna get in 
Dont nobody  wanna be left in the wind

[Layzie Bone]
Uh-oh
Niggaz thats not tryna listen to Bone 
The early bird get the worm
Take the game by the throat and squeeze
Till the muthafucka broke believe
Its murda we wrote 
Its dope that we serve on the curb to the booth
These niggaz dont feel it cuz we spit the truth
Aint never no fake and they got me to prove
Haters just hate and we do what we do

Let um talk to you in the face
Only because we blew up in they face 
If was Bone hurtin 
If that was the case 
Ill probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga jus move and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga dont quit till I finish the race
Number one is the place 

[Chorus x2]

[Krayzie Bone]
Now we ridin by [x4]
