[Krayzie Bone]
As you can see I took the pill took the pill, right to the house
Grab a shot of liquor and pop pop popped it in my mouth
An' I'm thinkin to my self that this might be a waste of my time, 
cause what if I don't even get high
Thirty minutes dun came by, I didn't even seem high, 
until I stood up and looked at the ceiling for some reason
Now I'm tweakin, then I tried to walk but I was SSLLOOWW
I guess I'm floatin in ecstasy  Just like the nigga told me

[Krayzie Bone & Flesh Bone]
I fell so realish realish realish, cause we floatin in ecstasy. [4x]

[Flesh Bone]
My name come alive . 
An I'm pokin in sumpin oh damn but it ain't no joke  
Cut guards and red beans
And for them niggaz that follow me around for my mojo
Feelin so see... Cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
Alright Ahh, my nigga just call up the homie
To hook us up on that liquid G
An if these hoes don't wanna see, they gotta check the spot quickly
Im feelin way high, but I'm also feelin way low
But damn I'm stuck in between. 
Fuckin wit broad boys and neva get used
Just help, just throw in a few more. 
Diablos, nigga Flesh Bone so chill
I'm feelin it hump through my body, feelin hot an exotic
Feelin knocked out, feelin too sexy for my muthfuckin self
Gotta find my bitch and fuck her ass to death

[Krayzie Bone & Flesh Bone]
I feel so realish realish realish cause we floatin in ecstasy. [4x]

[Layzie Bone]
Whose my nigga that told me the level I started to see the devil
Nigga was floatin in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill.  Couldn't feel nothin so I'm breakin
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this
Im lookin at my homegirl like I wanna, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step an started stumblin
An I was tryin to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, 
so I guess I'm mumblin
Fall off into sumpin.  But I guess I'm on a mission
Tellin my niggaz that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listenin
Whistlin hangin out tha window, need me some indo.  
Till I let go like, me silky fine.ine.ine. 
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at tha door.  
But nigga was paranoid so I grabbed the gun bucked it at the door 
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm runnin a secret cuz.. cuz a nigga can't take it.
Shake it if I can but I'm blendin wit da killas
And I wish E was here to feel pillish

[Wish Bone]

But I'm trippin, body moves, won't nobody get hurt hurt

[Bizzy Bone]
Groanin, groanin, groanin and she ain't even in the car
