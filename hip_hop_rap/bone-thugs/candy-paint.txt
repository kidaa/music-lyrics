[Layzie]
Your boy Lil Layzie comin through all in that black Monte Carlo

Ima tryna get around cars with no regards for this traffic

[Wish]
If you see that dash strong ya know what to do, ya know what to do, ya know what to do
We was fittin to roll not gon let me roll ?? watchin for them popos mashin down that 71

[Chorus]

[Wish]
Stomp it bash it with my 350 rocket, Cutlas

For a little for juice i supercharge it

[Krayzie]
I swing my doors open, my doors open

Big bumps, big bumps big trunks
Try to let off take it to the other side

[Layzie]

[chorus]

[Layzie]
Gotta have it nigga my weapon is automatic nigga

Cause these 24 inches spinnin is usually good for makin they heads twirl
