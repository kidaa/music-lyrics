Only time will tell who diez, these are the days of our livez 
Come look deeply in my eyes, these are the days of our livez
See tha murda mortalise, see tha murda mo, these are the days of our livez

[CHORUS: 2x]
Now come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugz 
We more than thugz, more than thugz, more than thugz 
With just a little twist of harmony we smokin' lethal warriors 
We warriors, We warriors, we warriors

[Layzie Bone]
Eternally thugz here i come tellin them souldier stories
Been daily collectin my lessons, without any questions
Without any questions, stressin no restin, we journey this blessin'
Shift in tha game rearrange ya thangs
cause once tha world waz bringin' me down
Mesmerized controlled by tha other side, but tha devil was in my town
looking for me 

[Wish Bone]
But he won't find me in time, fucking with Bone and he liking these rhymes

We raw before we go broke, nigga we robbin ya'll, all of ya'll, all ya'll

[Krayzie Bone]

You depend on that nigga wherever then I will be there, lean on me
But let us get rid of tha enemiez be stayin a while, while
But if you think you can hang, hang, hang 

[Chorus x2]

[Layzie Bone]
Finally in the studio, ya'll know we roll hydro everytime we rhyme
I'm high, look at me deeply in my eyes, I rise to the top of my game
No way that I had to run, no way that I had to turn
Sherm, but alot of these niggas won't learn
But tha money I earn won't burn So come again 

[Wish Bone]
Betta watch that Mack 10 nigga this one's for me and my friends
We steadliy rollin', I told ya keep bringin' home platinum and gold ones

With tha clack, back, put it on tha ground, now get down 

[Bizzy Bone]
Well it must be dawse, hydro, wanna roll my indo
Sittin all alone in ah my window, little Eazy bless his soul, It's so cold
Little Eazy got stress for tha peeps, the streetz
And none of these phonies hardly knew him 
But still wanna pop tha bitch locing bitch locing. 

[Chorus x2]

[Bizzy Bone]
And it ain't no mystery the pistol'll be and i betta put it under my seat
Betta read tha scripturez sista, reach any or all of my readers 
Said it ain't, it maybe double me up and get one foe my friends
Twenty, twen, twen, 
So who wanna bag, Who wanna bag, 
You wanna bag You wanna bag, You gotta bag 
So I'm sending my dawg to tha liqour store for tha bluntz to roll
Only tha Lord can tell who dies
So pick up tha puzzle and pieces and put it together my love 

[Krayzie Bone]
My lody Lord, maintain, it's hard cuz I'm a souldier at war
Cause everbody wanna try to bring out tha devil in me
But tha evils ain't betta than me, weed keeps me at ease
Take notes cause here it comes
Tha murda mo comin' to carry you, oh you oh
Wake up and they sittin and pullin their guage out, Murder
And they put it up to your temple and we blow your brains out, Die

[Chorus x4]
