And this will belong in time, can ya feel tha painz of our life
been in wined, and ya thought of dyin', my my my
Have ya thought of dyin' Let's not visualize
If you feel me! Then ya betta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
If you feel me! Then ya betta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Can you visualize your own pain, could ya imagine
breathin' yo' last breath, I bet ya, ya can't you don't wanna stay
Dear Lord, cannot stand, goin' to hell. It's comin', yes it's comin
No look what we've done, what have we done
Amongst our sin, why here, we follow people for starez, don't stare
No mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Evil is lurkin', lurkin', lurkin
We can run but can't escape tha beast, no
Tickin' by that snake in tha grass, that snake in tha grass
by that snake in tha grass. Better sticked, and missed his ass

So I gotta keep my mind up on my money, it's survival of tha fittest

Worried enough, we called in jail, Lord bless our babies
Lord pleaze bless our babies
