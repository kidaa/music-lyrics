[Chorus: Rihanna]
The First Time You Kissed My Lips 
The First Time Your Finger Tips 
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist 
The First Rhe First The First

The First Time You Kissed My Lips 
The First Time Your Finger Tips 
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist

I Knew I Was Meant For This
The First Time You Held Me Close
The First Time I Couldn't Say No
So Lossed In Side Of You I Knew
I Was Met For You

Wooh... I Think Everybody Remember The First Time 
I Do, Its Irresistable, Its Unstoppable 
Guess Who, First Time Fab 
Sound Like You Hear Me For The First Time Again Baby Haha

[Verse 1: Fabolous] 
My First Time Checkin You, Only Took A Second To 
Start Inspectin You, Without Disrespectin You 
Wasn't Inspectin You, To Say It Was Affectin You 
What You Wearin Got Me Starin Like You Butt Naked Boo 
It May Seem, Like I Dont Even Reckon You 
But I Day Dream, About Kissin On The Neck Of You 
Style Is Impeccable, Smile Is Incredible 
Ain't Nothin' Like Ya, And Baby I Done Met A Few You 
The Way I Feel Its Almost Like Crush Crushh
My Heart Beats Faster Its Almost Like A Rush Rushh
And Thats Just When You In A In A Room 
I Could Tell When You Round By The Scent Of Ya Perfume 
I See Why They Put These R&B; Songs Together 
I Feel Like Mariah "We Belong Together" 
Its My Pleasure, I Treasure, That I Met Ya 
Bet Ya I Could Get Ya On The First Time
