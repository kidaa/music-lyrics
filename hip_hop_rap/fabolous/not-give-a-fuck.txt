I'm here to shake up the world...
What what what what what
What what what what what
Right, right - ghetto

I'm somethin' like a phenomenom,
But still dumpin' whenever the drama's on,
Ya'll hustlers can't eat fit meals,
And it feels somethin' like when it's Ramadan,
Hope you chumps been walkin' with armor on,
Somethin's turnin' his momma on,
I love to see rumps in Farragama thongs
Bet it look plump when you got pajama's on,
Jump in, let's hit the Bahama's ma',
And it's crunk whenever I'm on the song,
Bumpin' like "Bumb-ba-Bump,"
I'm particularly picky,
When it comes to licky licky,
Have'em slidin' off them Vickie's quickly,
Under the doo-rag thick three sixty,
It's the hypno and sticky icky,
I said Okay!

[Chorus]
I'm fly enough, to do better,
But pimp enough to not give a fuck,
And I'm thug enough, to do better,
And gangsta enough to not give a fuck,
I'm hustlin' enough, to know better,
But ballin' enough to not give a fuck,
And I'm, old enough, to know better,
But young enough to not give a fuck

D-d-d-d-dammit man,
I'm in a throwback so old,
It'll make your grandma glance,
And everybody know, everybody go,
So please, call the stretch ambulance,
These dudes don't stand a chance,
When I pull up like the pamper brand,
Those in the Lambo slants,
With a madame from France,
With a ass so big,
You couldn't hide it in hammer pants,
Who else be in New York,
With Miami tans,
Got everybody doin' the street family dance,
I'm sure this hammer can,
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man,
F-A-B, you preferably,
Don't wanna F wit me,
Please believe it,
I'm definately, as responsible,
For gettin' the City High as 'Clef would be,
Believe it please

[Chorus]

I'm introduced to your women friends,
'Cause I buy double duces to rent a benz,
Like they boots made by Timbaland,
I have to remind, since I got drafted and signed,
Ya'll playa's get used to the scrimagin'
Not one of the Jesuses got lemon gems?
Y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine,
I prove letting loose but the semi can boost my adrenaline,
You never had no use with that lem again,
Half my roots is Dominican,
Faboloso mi gusto le bengamins,
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him,
Turn to stones like medusa got a glimpse of them,
But right now you can lie and gossip too,
And later be the guy the dude spoke to,
And right now you can try to prosecute,
But later in you gon die in the hospital

[Chorus]
