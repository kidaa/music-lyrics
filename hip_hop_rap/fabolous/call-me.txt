Girl, that was a one night fling
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me knowing how quick that this youngn be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jumatries
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made ooh
During the escapade ooh
In the back of the Escalade whoa
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve uh huh
But Shorty dived in head first and didnt come up to breath shit

In the pent house blasting Mob Deep and some Bobby Brown uh huh

If theres one thing Im giving her, it gotta be back shots uh
She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot ahhh uh
At the same time she jerking and wiggling uh huh
Smirking and giggling ha ha ha

The way she working and fingering
She must have be a gymnast
Cuz the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments

Hoping that this dont turn into a fatal attraction ut uh
She screaming fabolous give me one more chance; fabolous give me one more chance
