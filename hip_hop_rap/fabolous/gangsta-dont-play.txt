Stonyahoy!!! Stigading wuy na na ding ding wuy!!! Yeah ha ha ha!!!

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
Yes I waan dem fi know, seh real warriors don't play
And if yuh romp wid us, you have to run away
I waan dem fi know, seh real gangstas don't play
And if they romp wid us, they have to run away

Slip dem go slip and now a slide dem go slide Slide
Only a fool get caught up in his own pride Pride
Hope dem ready fi di ride

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Gnagstas ain't this fly, this is just a rare occasion
You can hear it's blazin soon as the leer is raisin
Hell yeah we hazin, sexy pair of Bajans
Chinky eyes dark hair you would swear they Asian
They Bahama mamas, hols the llama mamas
Put the gangsta grills on when it's drama mama
Murder them, murder them, they don't make a move until they get word from him
I could be in Fiji, one call to Gigi
She on some Belly shit like X with a squiggie
They say it's gangsta but it's just the way of life
If life's a bitch better make everyday your wife
I'm from the era of the shootouts from drug spots
Happy to be here so I smile in my mug shots
The David Dinkins years, I even dug Koch
Before the George Bush drugs watch, Bloodclaat!!!

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
I waan dem fi know, seh real gangstas don't play
And if they romp wid us, they have to run away

[Verse 4]
Know they romp wid us and they go run and a hide Hide
Slip dem go slip and now a slide dem go slide Slide
Only a fool get caught up in his own pride Pride
Hope dem ready fi di ride

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
They say deaf before dishonor,
the scent that you smellin on my breath is marijuana before i left to tijuana
I told it was war so their nephew or their momma beter wear a tef or their a gonna
Rah-Rah
Thats what it sounds like when thugs cry, i see things i see wings when the slugs fly
Low life loso   P Wayne rugby low to them young niggas that know already
I go back like recline, no need to rewind , i still run through flatbush like the d-line
Usually just the team, cuz them extra niggaz be unnecessary, just like an uzi with a beam,
a cuzzi full of steam, Suzie and Janeen, niggaz do shit like
this but its usually in their dream, gangstas dont sleep unless there guns by the bed,
ever wonder why the bread get snatched by the feds

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
I waan dem fi know, seh real gangstas don't play
And if they romp wid us, they have to run away

[Verse 6: Junior Reid]
Know they romp wid us and they go run and a hide Hide
Slip dem go slip and now a slide dem go slide Slide
Only a fool get caught up in his own pride Pride
Hope dem ready fi di ride
