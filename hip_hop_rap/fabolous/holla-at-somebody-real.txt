You are now tuned in to W.F.A.B radio

[Fabolous] Yo...Baby Girl where you at ?

[Lil Mo] Right here...Right here...right here baby

Here's another one

[Fabolous]
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself
Wont nobody do as much as myself
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself
For a pretty girl as such as yaself
Cuz ima busy man I dont see too much for myself
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I... make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women
Theres some who be willing and skimming
And dive in to relationships cuz I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens
But feelings aint the only thing that you can catch now
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous
Others pass diseases that you can catch now
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world
And.. i dont wanna live in it alone
Come on

[Chorus - Lil Mo]
Ill give you all my love 
And you can always trust
My loyalty, honesty, and security and ill never
Ill never leave no..no..no
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me
So holla at somebody real cuz i
Cuz im so real

[Fabolous]
real love Im searching for a real love like j blige in 92
awwwwwwh but I pray I will find you
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
Thats why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But..I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick 
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When its real im all in it
But I dont want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
noooo before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to.. good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do

[chorus]

[Lil Mo]
No im not trying to pressure you 
But my loves to incredible
For to waste
In front of your face
Then I give you something you can feel 
To let you know your hollering at somebody real

[Fabolous]
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But Im the kinda cat that strays away
Thats til somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend soem days aways
On a asia bay
Eating food made the cajun way
And sippin a lil saki
Blowin a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull im choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real

[Chorus 2x]
