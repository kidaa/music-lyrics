Yo don't bother me kid
Let a nigga live plus eat
Bless the wiz and protect my seed
[Gatekeeper]
I filter distortion like a magnet
Attract rappin bandits
Stretch em and blast em over the canvas
Blatant replies to that blast my exercise won't be televised
Due to the rise of spirits or my transparent perseverance
Fuck a publishers clearance, Gatekeep's runnin interference
Yo, you can dissect it
The black prospecta
I'm cold as a pirate's luger
Choke on my hymic maneuver
I breathe life in the fire
When my designs are tight like pliers
Born in a pillow of barbed wire
Taught by Ebenezer Scrooge in my mom's church choir
The death stalker
New York trendtogrophy
The G-O-D, 120 degree geography
The bomb thick iron skin without a blemish
Black art of war chemist
Carry out the death sentence with deadly vengeance
What I'm seekin is your head on a skillet
Soakin in burgundy liquid
Self inflected wounds fill pounds in Grant's tomb
And more damage than a monsoon
Niggas explodin like aquatic moons
I mutate your functions
Like a devine evil after midnight in Broadway junction
[Gatekeeper & Grym Reaper]
Keep it pumpin, yo, yo, yo
Anything you're given can be taken away
Any place anywhere anytime any day
Gravedigga forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But yo can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and still not get blast in the heart
[Grym Reaper]
You're just a weaklin
Seekin to peep Grym's steelo
I sting like mosquitoes
Ten times as lethal
The skill of my tongue is similar to Attila the Hun
Swingin a sword Grym is gruesome
World renown like hunger
The mighty hunter in the concrete junga
Doper than ganja
Conquer any style you can conjure
Take your momma's breath away like anacondas
Fronters get cast asunder
Lightening fast I bring thunder
Ancient rules blast the mic
Crushin fools paradise leavin you parasites under
Ground, beef is shredded, paramedics'll greet you
I defeat crews with parametric EQ's
All types of anastetics'll be used
My pressure's like the barometric when I squeeze you, hahaha
Removed of this earthly ball of clay
Let the chips fall where they may
I'll be servin you all day everyday
Consider you a serious threat, heh anyway...
[Gatekeeper & Grym Reaper]
Gravedigga forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and not get blast up in the heart
Gravedigga forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and not get blast up in the heart
What, yo Yo
Gravediggaz Forever
'97 and beyond Beyond word is bond word is bond
Keep keep keepin it on to the break of dusk to dawn
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Rzarector, Undertaker, Gatekeeper, the Grym Reaper
Yo, caught you in the sleeper
Gravediggaz forever
