Intro: Masta Ase
The Masta, the Ase-Inc
Lost is the ghetto dweller trapped in a cage
There's no way out of the death trap
Chorus: Gatekeeper
You can't come back [back]
no matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back [back]
no matter what you do when you fall
Verse One: Gatekeeper
Time and time again life's getting shorter
Fear in the air what appears is the border
A nigga named Stef, was shootin up meth
with some coke, had a stroke, so I chilled for his death
Time has arrived, four-in-one mind
All the sin steppin in on my face there's a grin
Another dumb vic once moved now step
Grabbed em by the wrist, come to the abyss
Meet Katie, abortion was known with this lady
A Ph.D. many degrees had Mercedes car
She took it to a bar got lit
Like a skunk got drunk, danced rather bumped
Boom, she took the car to the nigga's pad
She didn't want to kick it so the bitch got stabbed
Wrong place and wrong time don't exist no more
or for, according to the Gravedigga law
So watch what you do 'fore a fool talks back
and behold, riding on your shoulders a Death Trap
Chorus
Verse Two: Ryzarector
This crab named Black, brother sell up crack
And it's a natural fact, in his pockets he had stacks
Bad ass beemer he drove, cause he sold his soul
to get ahold of the chrome and gold
True, he felt good as he walked his hood
Bein hunted every night, like a bear in the woods
See cops play the role of a fox
if they catch your ass out on the block, ock
it's back to the penalty box
But Black was the type that was like
";Yo fuck the C-cipher
 I got to get papes, every night";
Trailed but you came for kills
See cipher, ain't the only niggaz on the bill
He had like a quarter mil stashed on him
With the click, came through, and he blasted em
So perhaps you're catchin mad snap like that
nigga Black, smack, but you caught by the death trap
Chorus - 2X
Verse Three: Grym Reaper
Bitch she had a body like a Lexus Coupe
Her step-father, was robbin the cradle bangin the boots
her heartbeat increased at night she couldn't sleep
Daddy dearest, was bringin her grief between sheets
Deep scars invaded her soul force and mind
Six years of torture started at age nine
At age sixteen already an old maid
deceived, she was caught like Freddy in a bad dream
Meanwhile her body is being defiled
Tellin her mother, only brought a stage of denial
Moms followed pops on the low-down
led to a showdown, for a week shit slowed down
But one night overcome by lust
Father Dukes tried to score just one more thrust
He should've held back the RZA got an axe
Gave his dick forty whacks and threw his ass in the death....
[You can't come back]
