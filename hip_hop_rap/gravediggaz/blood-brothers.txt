Intro: Prince Rakeem/Ryzarector
It is written [manifest]
That all men are brothers [prophecy]
We come like blood brothers [word is bond]
Cause blood is thicker than water [ain't alike]
From the misty grounds [from the unknown]
The shadows [the deep]
The darkness [the triple darkness]
Gravediggaz [my blood brother]
The RZA
Verse One:
I grew up in the violent island of Shaolin
Fifty-five home and cease thoughts implore
When jackpot rot was hot, I was not
A rusty-ass child with tears and snots
Acquired the knowledge, how to master my thoughts
My skinny frail body couldn't fuck with the sports
Six feet two still wack on the court
So I stalked New York with a black pitchfork
My style date back to ninety-watt
cuttin the box, while I be clocks with no socks
Remember the days before your pants would sag
Puerto Ricans on the block just throwin up tags
Verse Two: Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper
Yo I was born with a rusty spoon as a mouthpiece
Life was hard cause the graves was my company
Hang with my problems just as trouble predicted
to cross the path, as I laugh at the vic-ted
No warmth for sure, the vents would spit average
watchin devils, fiend like a savage
Blood brothers need me call, ooh-OOH!!!
In a minute, a minute, Ghostface and all, check it
With the Grym and the Undertake
Devil's get baked I'll stiff your ass like an eighth
Tortures and screams building up my steam
Death to whoever bumrushes through the bloodstream
Yo somethin ain't right I don't get it
I feel a vibe blood brothers are you with it
If I have to choose one or the other
Back the fuck up spook, yo that's my blood brother
Chorus: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper
All, all, all and together
Blood brothers, rollin together
  Repeat 4X
Verse Two: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper
Back in the days of Lee's and BVD's
I grew up deceived, by wicked enemies
My lifespan began to dim in the error
When you can't even trust the man in the mirror
Now Gravedigga niggaz receive my trust
and like Christ, we walk among the thieves and the sluts
I bring stress like skins on PMS
The street's a bloody mess, there ain't no EMF
in sight my thoughts are to leave the slums
I hustle with beats and drums not keys and guns
My feet are numb, as I walk my dogs
I cut off the fogs with the Gravedigga swords
Life parole, as me and my man is violated
Hookers are neutered and spay-ted
Snakes are decapitated, and castrated
Niggaz is lost your whole Ark is bein raided
Shows today are hectic, niggaz'll wreck shit
Lift off rounds and jet quick
This piece is gettin heated
Cause a rush, a stampedin
Devils are all defeated by the blood brothers
Chorus
Verse Three: Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper, Ryzarector
Yeahhh, as the earth erupts
I conduct to destruct your rucks when I big up
Catastrophes are blaspheme
Pour a container of brains on your grave through a strainer
I capsize your coffin, I wreck your morphin
Breakin devils down like Steve Austin
I gotta rip on a peel for a minute
Let's get some god degree, cause a blood brother's hard to be
Power equality
Allah sees equality, follow me
Law and order but I stick it in water
Many heads got slaughtered back in Latin Quarters
Like this brother named Rick was thick but got bit
by the same motherfucker that he ran with
Band of the hand the Clan's my fam
Something mom duke could never understand
From the grave to the gutter
Death to another, who tries to fuck with my blood brothers
Chorus
