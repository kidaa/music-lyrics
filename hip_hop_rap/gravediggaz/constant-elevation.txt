[Grym Reaper/Too Poetic]
Beeeware!  Four figures appear through the fog
Yeah!  Gravediggaz cut like swords... rrRRRAAA!!
Fear makes ya brain go numb
You ain't, got a clue, where the Gods, come from
I sold my-self to exist and then I flittle
With millions of sperm cells and I found the eggggg
Know I got my chance
I came to enhance represent and get open as a bank
[Fruitkwan]
Pass it, a deep theourassic
Gravediggaz are massive, puttin niggaz in caskets
Blowin like the wind, when I'm in my spin
ya got fucked cross the path of the twister
You face the storm and bring it onnnnn
and get chopped in the blocks from Hitchcock
The birds, my mental ward is my brainstorm
Somehow I flipped and came equipped with a chainsaw
[Grym Reaper/Too Poetic]
Diggin graves see, pays my rent for the day
Some hate the image that I must portray
Critics, say ";Go to hell"; I say ";Yeah,
stupid motherfucker I'm already there!";
Fru-strated, mentally aggravated
to be the rebel that society created
I'm good most times but when I'm foul then I'm flagrant
Livin in the shadows like a government agent
[Fruitkwan]
Ummm, one side of the story
Shit cooked up from Gravediggaz labratory
Transformin brains with remains of a slug
With the Undertaker makin beats that's buuuuuugged
Path we creatin
Splittin G's, choppin necks with the fat guillotines
I'm your nightmare, fright with verse, one verse
Will put your ass in my black hearse
[Ryzarector/The RZA]
Ryza-rector, ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
Hooah, hooah, hooah, hoo!
Danger, enter the graveyard, chamber
It's like, diggin, in yer EAR, with a hanger
I inject my poison stinger, into your finger
Of all your life forces, I'll take ya
I'm blood, thirsty, thirsty for sure
About to blood suck the same ones, who blood suck the poor
You're, not safe, anymore
To all the holy spooks, I declare war
I'll, gravedig them up from hell, ryzarect them
From the poisonous bones of swine, I disinfect them
Positive Energy Activates, Constant Elevation
Positive Energy Activates, Constant Elevation
[Prince Paul]
Out of the darkness
Out of the deep of the darkness
Lies the Gravediggaz
from the parts unknown
The world that's unknown
People fear what they don't understand
So, this is why we're here
To explain that there's nothin to be afraid of
Have no fear, Gravediggaz are here
