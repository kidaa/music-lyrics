Intro: Ryzarector, Grym Reaper
Aiyyo Reaper, those kids out there say you're mad thirsty
You got somethin for them to drink?
  Yo we can wet up two cups of blood
Verse One: 
Arm to the leg, leg, on to the head!  Yo
Be the Ryzarector, resurrect the mental dead
  G to the R to the Y M Reaper
  As I get deeper than a crypt, resurrect, kid!
Don't go against the grain, mad slang is my thang
I leave the hearty party with a bang buzza
Boom!  Check my tune, it gotcha hyper
Don't give a fuck about a sucker C-cipher!
  As you decipher the tricks of a viper
  Swine is lethal! ... is evil!
  I am original, we can build upon
  The ill form, and keep all your braincells warm!
Hocus pocus, yo!  What's the focus?
Weak techniques you speak, the shit is bogus
  Even in a mortuary, slangin' some boom
  As I seek the knowl' from the womb to the tomb
Verse Two:
Yo!
Deadly, deadly, HYAH!  Get ready
Here come the styler, wilder than Freddy
  Dead 
Cause a Krueger, boom, I do ya
Just to let ya know Gravediggaz comin' through ya
  Dead stinkin' rotten, your braincells forgotten
  The past, you had your bumba raas pickin' cotton
  Now ya hate ya knotty hairstyles
  I guess you figure the texture is too wild
  Child
Two cups of blood, boy
Two cups of blood, girl
Aw, drink that shit up
