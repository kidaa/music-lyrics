[Grym Reaper]
Ghettos are becomin lost
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
They stay dumb deaf and blind
Yo caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is maken
Losses are taken, mindstates are shaken
Until our forces awaken
Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is maken
Losses are taken, mindstates are shaken
Til our forces awaken
[Grym Reaper]
General Grym
What's the pleasure principle
Attack the enemies at every interval
And keep our casualites at a minimal
Camoflauged down now I launch my offensive
To arm leg-a leg the defenseless
Cause criminals and dons are relentless
Murders are common and senseless
In the ghetto trenches the stench is
Tremendous and poverty, our property is defended by shotguns
Alarm, pit bulls and barbed wire fences
If you're not armed you're in harm's way
You're hunted by wannabe desparados and hombres
I'm sick of all this shit
Rappers defeatin me on oscillatin frequencies
Speakin about operatin frequently
With keys from Columbians and Dominicans
You silly men, traitors, snakes and reptilians
Niggas act like dumb animals in pit full and cock fights
Attackin each other then carjackin at stop lights
Fuck all you cold blooded race killers
That's proud to be blood spillers of ebony pillars
Black devils are worse than those of the cursed seed
Foes better check they approach me the first G
R-Y-M, you know the name
I'm hated by the beats like the Feds hate Saddam Hussein
Positive brothers ain't gotta be soft
It's time to start knockin you fake niggas off!
What!
Ghettos are becomin lost
Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is maken
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
Losses are taken, mindstates are shaken
They stay dumb deaf and blind
Til our forces awaken
Ghettos are becomin lost
Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is maken
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
Losses are taken, mindstates are shaken
They stay dumb deaf and blind
Til our forces awaken
[Gatekeeper]
Feeler of the grace as your bodytone get laced
You and I must verse to coincide our universe
Relevance yo true dat, prepare for the risks
No handout, I chop your fuckin hand off from the wrist
I ditect the vibes weak brothers try to hide
Inside, they ain't strapped for the ride it's suicide
I spread like a fungus, ran the devil from among us
Let the rain in the days in the valley of Columbus
The all-natural cosmetic, supernatural gi-netic
My genes, by all means, they backpass synthetics
Rhetoric, hair weaves, bare blunts and cigarettes
Sexist directors, crossdress infectors
Spawn of a form of neuron who ain't warned of the wicked
The devil's technician, the division
And smash into grains of sand
From the hourglass
[Omen]
And you have been warned
In the gun shooter
So let's see cold soldier from the future
The tribe intruder
Twelve tribe saluter
Marchin with an army of extra-terrestial beings
Descended from celestial beings
Been fightin the holy war for eons
Wise words that guided missiles, Yacub's blade of steel
Gods use mental pistols and Ezekial's wheel
The apocalypse, convertin this metropolis
To an acropolis, twelve armageddon acropolis
No resort of seclorum, Babylon's the forum
The Black mind and spirit is at hand I'm fightin for em
A holy war with the beast with the 7 heads
It's your last supper, feast on this of livin bread
[Shabazz The Disciple]
I triple dart mines try not aim the rhyme laser
Beings make it weak, beings screams for the fake
Unseen racid ya faced traitors face elimination
And escape the bad disaster's path for aftermath
I laughed and blast have mad people's units
Weak mind created crime-related rahs can't fuck with my blueprints
Stupid, the end is near while fools give up the youth
Yappin force action they gat clappin guns and beer
Beer is done skunks and fear the other knotty set up
To killers, you faked up niggas shut the hell up
I'm fed up so I develop the ill scheme to envelop
These bitch teen sweated up black devil vessiles
I'll dead you with lethal style evil ogre
Slash demon cobra in these last days a scientist take over
With this elimination process
You pathetic brainwashed niggas don't test the niggess
[Grym Reaper]
