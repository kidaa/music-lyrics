Yo hold up stop stop
What's goin on, what's goin on
Yo what's goin on, what's goin on I'm just holdin on
What's goin on what's goin on
What's goin on, what's goin on
What's goin on what's goin on
What's goin on I'm just holdin on
What's goin on I'm just holdin on
What's goin on, what's goin on
What's goin on what's goin on
What's goin on I'm just holdin on
What's goin on I'm just holdin on

Yo
If you could soar the sky like a bird
Would you be disturbed to see brothers on the curb smokin herb
And cops from the third precinct rush in
Like a herd
Chargin up the league with possession
Freeze em and arrest em
Strip search em then undress em
Make the youngsters come and then sign a confession
Or would you watch the cop in the chopper
With the high powered binocular cameras
Attached the bottom of his aircraft
Takin photographs of your lab
Pointin a 50 millimeter 500 shot magazine full clip gat at your back
Hoverin the projects, spotlight shinin bright
On movin targets
Infrared light at night on dark objects
Harassin citizens who hasn't been charged yet
Would you order a flock of pelicans to jam their propellers
On top see forfeit the death system failure
Take these devils off, I witness Tom broke off
Mentally fry his brain and blow the smoke off
Killa Bee, presidential suite, Bill and Hillary
Bow and kiss my feet
Auxillary security retreat
Heavy artillary sun heat
Meet the agony defeats the cavalry
Six-pack battery back, anti-gravity raps
Snaps your head inside the bear trap
You can't adapt to the habitat
The biggest jigsaw puzzle be the world map
Niggas think that they own things and man sit high upon thrones
When you die tell me what the fuck you own
When your skin flesh and bones find a permanent home
As food for worms or fossils trapped in stone

What's goin on What's goin on
I'm just holdin on What's goin on
What's goin on What's goin on
I'm just holdin...

Airborne planes with ultra rays
Aerosol sprays leavin tracemarks, you're picked up on radar
Trackin your moments, political opponents
Everything you own now he owns it
From the genesis exact off the tip
Undergoin metamorphosis through computers in your offices
A crystal construct a nuclear missile
Every fifth school we produce more pistols
Documented details, shocked at retails
Shipped to the ghetto for resale
Peep the calamitist dreams and destroy the thermometers
Droppin like niggas unemployed
[Gatekeeper Blue Raspberry]
What's goin on, what's goin on What's goin on
Just holdin on, just holdin on What's goin on
What's goin on, what's goin on What's goin on
What's goin on, just holdin on What's goin on
[Grym Reaper]
Yo triple 6 is established
The average savage cabbage is tryin to live lavish
Off of the credit card balances
The magnetic strips that stick onto plastic
New World Order system of society that's cast us
Masses is mastered and broadcasters speak
The media breach and your optic forefathers
Topics is wild as fiction
To lessen the friction my children beware the pale rider
Your life is slipped into a microchip
I warned you with all of the mics that I grip
Cash days fade away devils roll hard
Trappin souls inside of Visa gold cards
[9th Prince]
Yo this is cerebal warfare
Nuclear golden sphere attacks the hemisphere
Leaves the human fearness of the pit of urban tears
Dedicate my life to Allah, each bar's a star
Far from Mars, for vengeance my opponents die hard
Panasonic electronic thoughts cut short your life support
Half deceased enemies are buried alive at the Wu mount enterprise
Raisin cane remain pain in the brain
Stain the mindframe
Slay like heroin bein shot in the veins
9th Prince the principle, I was born invicible
Slew with a tribute to my attribute
Weak lyricists in my cipher stay mute
My wisdom is sword justice
Chop off the head of those who can't be trusted
I'm signin off as I let my knowledge be born
Sharp like a thorn
Bloods callin themselves Gods, yo
What's goin on

What's goooooiiiiiinnnn oooonnnnnn
