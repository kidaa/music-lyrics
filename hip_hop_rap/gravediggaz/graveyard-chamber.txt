Chorus: Rzarector
Danger Danger, Danger Danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger, Danger Danger, Danger Danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger, Danger Danger
Enter the Graveyard Chamber
Danger Danger Stranger is major
Enter the Graveyard Chamber
Verse One: Grymreaper
Ahh, Here a moan
The night is dark and feel fear
You're lost, cold and confused
But I'm in prayers
Afraid of a beast that stalked the earth
You're bringing the Jesus
It cross don't work ha ha ha
I seen your type before
You read all the laws but 
you're scared to go to war
Timid and frail why faith got ya geese
Ya stolen the truth and that all your beliefs
Are you aware son
it's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Grymreap comes with my dangerous tongue
I'm outta control like yo kids with guns
Words that stored in a murderous thoughts
My profile as nasty as maggots in pork
I'm dark and damp
enough to rush amps
with the jaws of a flatbull or rusty can
Partial Chorus
Verse Two: Dreddy Krueger
I be the Bushwick dutchmaster rapper
I love black women and I hate fuckin crackers
Check me yo
My breath stink 'cause I smoke skunk punk
everyday of the month
in a dutchmaster fuckin blunt
Bust the cliche
Niggas talkin he-say-she-say about me 
ya bitch-ass-niggas
Y'all not ass, y'all titty
y'all style is shitty
How dare you try to represent New York fuckin City
I been down since BVDs and dew rags
shelltops and shags
I was a little badass with regular and tre bags
Always tryin to get shit I never had
'cause times is bad like luck
That's why I don't give a fuck
I dig up my nose and my butt
on the bus or the train
This is for niggas walkin in the rain
listenin to they walkmane
talkin the New York fuckin slang
Partial Chorus
Verse Three: Rzarector
In the streets of New York
bullshit walk, green talks
I be the giant on the top of your beanstalk
waving down your flags
jagged grab niggas with bloody rags
holdin fat bags
takin heavy drags
then I add more shells to the mags
Shots goin off you getin caught like tag
The diamond crystal I be rippin up your flesh tissue
and have my pitbull lockin on your bone gristle
Castin shadows in every battle
I rabble words like scrabble
drag your brain through the gravel
at the speed of sound of ryhme travel
Allow me to dabble
with a flow that's infallable
Maintain your order
as words I slaughter
I destroyed a 
whole city like Soddom and Gomorrah
or Babylon
I'm runnin shit like a marathon
Niggas frontin Don
with a set like Frank Avalon
Verse Four: Scientific Shabazz
Shabazz is here to cause panic
Another fuckin madman born to the planet
Sendin niggas to the pearly gates
I'm psyched out
I got screws loose like Norman Bates
Shoot shit up like it's a gallery
Blowin snakes heads off to earn me a salary
Devils choke from the gunsmoke
Once I'm provoked,
I shove a fifth long down ya throat
and let ya taste the steel
Another body unidentified
Shit from the pot is spilled
Ya punk ass'll get out traumaed
I'm swellin devils' melons for my man Farak' Muhammed
Get a crew and try to surround me
and one by one I'll light y'all up
and send ya asses to King's County
Solo pro-morgue supplier
Ya want a nigga bang
Fuck Spenser, 'Bazz for hire
Verse Five: Gatekeeper
Make room the masculine Gatekeeper
kicks suspense in a terrified forms
that keep you warm
You're tensed up
Niggas get wrenched up
on a rock
Mix a whiplash,
bodies are gettin' smashed
So let the volcano blow and erupt
Destruction drift off
Niggas are gettin flipped on
Yeah comin after ya, huh
I only got half a ya
Other part froze in Alaska
While define the feast a high beam
Ghost of a drug fiend
I'm physical dreams
I breathe steam
Thoughts are plutonic
The chronic scripture
angles and riptures
I get ya
Yo, I smash like a comet
Punish tha drain ya
Partial Chorus
Verse Six: Killa Priest
I stalk the face like a leopard
The microphone shepherd
is speakin parables one and two, catch it
The brain counselor, track fertilizer,
the murdalizer
You never heard a wiser
I open heads like the archives
Allow me to explain my brain in the darkside
I strike ya beam 
and watch it gleam
I'm solar,
steadfast, patient like Noah
The rap psycho
be the enlightener
Prey upon the weak and strong I'm the sniper
And light that ass like gasoline
I dig through your chest like a jar of vasoline
I leave your brain regurgitating plancid
until your rhymes are exaperated
I clip up a niggas thoughts
with a pool of zodiac signs
and I slowly attack the mind
The Killa Priest will bend your ideas
I see you cry in fear
There's no surviving here
