Chorus:
Bang your head... bang, your, head!
Bang your head... bang, your, head!
[Grym Reaper] Rzarector!
[Rzarector]
You are not the same that I was when I was younger
I'm old with the Clan from my land, down under
Deep in the darkness, just like you regardless
Of who?  It's obvious!  Wee... ha!
So lounge in my burial ground, boy, my despot
I build a house on top, of Salem's Lot
Front porch, bloody, back yard, muddy
Like Amityville, a family kills
Force of humanity, drove me to insanity
Duel in all my rivalries, I speak of profanity
Motherfuck this!  Motherfuck that!  Bang your, head!
Chorus
[Someone Don't know the guy's name]
Here comes the killer with the GraveDigga sword, gimme room
Like devils in a Ouiji board I'm spellin' doom
Ever since 
, throwin' mad stones
And 
 catchin' 
 on a graveyard shift
 ain't a new phenom because my crew is on
Spots'll blow like nuclear bombs
With the killer instinct, rhymes are in synch
B-B-B-B-Bang your head til it shrinks!
Midnight marauder, bodies are gettin' slaughtered
Bring a cross and a bucket of holy water
You'll still'a be cajoled, 'cause the motherfuckin' Gravediggaz
 ... up your body, just like a clepto
Let's go, to the graveyard spot
Count up the knots, on the bodies that got dropped
So bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
Chorus x 2
[Somebody Don't know who's voice]
Gatekeep!
[Gatekeeper]
Yo,
I creep with the evil intent to represent
The course, the night, a swarm with the dark force
The killer brigade, twelve o'clock starts the raid
Torch is lit, oh 
Feel no pain those exposed to the raven
Deep in every step, a 
 like Wes Craven
Yo!  I eject the fume that spells doom
The wickedest flow, sweep, ya up like a broom
'Cause in the shadowy graves, of Medina high
You're one step away from the arena of death
Boom, bang!  Here I am, the bezerk
The ruthless killer, I do work
Dark forces thick, motherfuckers for real
Here's a tale from the crypt, bang your head!
Chorus x 7
