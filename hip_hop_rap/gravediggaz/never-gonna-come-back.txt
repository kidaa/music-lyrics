[Grym Reaper Gatekeeper]
Black woman
She's never gonna come back
Princess
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
Yo, yo
Just knowin she's never gonna come back
I heard the gun clap
I heard the gun clap
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
[Grym Reaper]
Yo
I saw the woman I love colored in blood
War is hell, I cut shells, was then covered in mud
As four ships hovered above, my heart griefs
But at least she didn't take the mark of the beast
Rest in peace boo
If I blessed then I'ma meet you on the other side
But for now I gotta slide
Through physical mindfields
Miserable is how my mind feels knowin it's long time to heal
Shit is real
Another black mold in a hole
God rest your soul as you travel back home
I'll carry your essence in the thoughts I'm manifestin
As pleasent memories outshine my depression
My physical stress says it's time to rest
Bein chased by the devil tryin to take my breath
Ain't a place on the Earth that you can't get touched
If I get bucked let my melanin rust hit the dust
[Grym Reaper Gatekeeper]
She's never gonna come back
The queen, the princess
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
Yo, yo
Just knowin she's never gonna come back
I heard the gun clap
I heard the gun clap
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
[Gatekeeper]
Yo my boo was hard as corn liquor when we met
Livin jet set, everything connect
Fitted like a seam double stitched
If I had a scratch she knew where to find the itch
Many warm hugs and soapy back rubs
Candlelight's held tight at the hips every night
My soul is cold boo, I can't abandon ship
Cause of false reactions, I miss you with a passion
Your new being represents a universal mean
So rise like cream black queen
Unfortunately you died in my arms
From a stray bullet from afar
That ripped through the car
My dreams are intense with very little sense
My pretense cracked to find an honor like a track boo
I wanna follow in persuit
What I got to do, what I got to do
[Grym Reaper Gatekeeper]
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
Yo, yo, yo
Just knowin she's never gonna come back
I heard the gun clap
I heard the gun clap
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
She's never gonna come back
Yo, yo, yo
Just knowin she's never gonna come back
When I heard the gun clap
I heard the gun clap
She's never gonna come back
I never find another honor like a track
[Grym Reaper]
Another casuality of war and the black-on-black crime saga
More drama for the ghetto
More human bodies ignited by metal
Yo, once they gone they never come back
Yo
