Big Gipp:
What makes the dogs hollar What makes the bouls roll
But I ain't got none, cause most be gettin' old
After two weeks slidin' in the rain
After the Braves game, where you headed man
Dawn county line, ready to straight mine
Watch the sun glare, peep the cold air
Those that understood, those that understand
I'm runnin' rampant on a Clampet in a mini van

chorus
For you to turn it up, buckle up
See you when I see you at the show crunk up 
For you to turn it up, buckle up
See you when I see you at the show crunk up 

T-Mo 1st and Khujo 2nd:

I been at that dope-d dope game for quite some time
Noody gave me shit, I worked hard for mine
I been up half the night, paranooid at this light
I saw the light at the end of the tunnel of life
Posting up with the team, it was dope at hand
Willie Kight, Terry, Gipp, and hello my man
We was draped like fo' real, cold night to snow
It was hard to believe it was lil' T-Mo

Gotta be 'round figures with petitions
Ain't yo' witches like you did found out 
In rental cars trust with they're figure tips burnt out
Kill me, happy trails had dominion 
Oh what a story they tell, ain't gone be no rails
Without the sistas, so lets spark this riot to triple K
Finna have my little buddy to jail because he reniged
His grand dragon of his duty, rest in peace charisma
In the heart of the chill cold south
I must learn how for....

chorus
You to turn it up, buckle up
See you when I see you at the show crunk up
For up to turn it up, buckle up
See you when I see you at the show crunk up

Cee-Lo:
Of course I been underestimated, but i'm patient so I waited
For these words to be related, God created, love and hated
It's alright, it's okay. I'ma speak this anyway
Many say it's life or death so I don't play any day
Hey, I did not come here to stay
I never tried to say I wanna to be old and grey 
When  God come get me, so take a chance wit' me
Come and dance wit' me to dance wit' me
Come on

chorus
It's for you to turn it up, buckle up
See you when I see you at the show crunk up
For you for you to turn it up, buckle up
turn it up and buckle it up
See you when I see you at the show crunkcrunk, crunk , crunk
