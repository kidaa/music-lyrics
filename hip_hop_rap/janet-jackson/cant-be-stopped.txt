Nothing's gonna stop us
We can't be stopped

I know that it's not been easy
Trying to make it in this crazy world
People 'round you try to stop you
Stomp you saying that you don't belong

You must remember that
We were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped
Stay stronger my sister you can't be stopped
No, you can't be stopped

I know that sometimes
You get to feelin' I've given up on you
The pressure seems to, to defeat you
Beat you when you feel you can't go on

You must remember that
You were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped
Stay stronger my brother you can't be stopped
No, you can't be stopped

Don't ever let nobody tell you you ain't strong enough
Strong enough, don't let nobody tell you you ain't
Strong enough, don't let nobody tell you

You know that I will be right here
To remind you that we need
Togetherness, 'cause lost pride
Has no room, if you don't forget
Where you come from
