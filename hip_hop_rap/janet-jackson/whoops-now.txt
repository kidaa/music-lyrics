Friday morning and all my work is done
I've packed my bags
I'm on the run
I got a feeling that I'm gonna have some
Fun in the sun with my friends and he's got me goin

[CHORUS:]
Whoops now
Sorry I can't go
Whoops now
Sorry I can't go
Whoops now
Sorry I can't go
Sorry I can't
Sorry I can't go now

Friday noon and my boss is on the phone
He's telling me that I can't leave home
An extra hand at work is what he's called for
He said we need you here
To my friends I'm goin

[CHORUS 2x]

It makes no difference if you're off work or not
You dream your weekend hand on the doorknob
Out with your friends, hey, fun in the sun now
That's when the phone rings

Friday evening and I'm all alone at home
I know my friends are havin fun
I'll plan my weekend, damn it, leave the machine on
Next time he calls he'll hear my voice sayin loud and clear

[CHORUS 2x w/ "I'm out havin fun in the sun with my friends"]

With my friends
With my friends
With my friends
With my friends

With Ann and Rusty
Tina and Moody

Lynette and Tony oh oh oh

To the restaurants

For some lobster
And some sleeping

And some you know what else
