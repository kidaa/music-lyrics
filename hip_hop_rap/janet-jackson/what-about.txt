We walked along the beach
What a moonlit night
He held my hand in his
He kissed me
He said "I wanna spend my life with you... I want you for my wife"
Just then I thought

[CHORUS:]
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that, what about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried, you wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that, what about that

I took a pause, then a deep sigh
He looked right into my eyes as he said
"I know I didn't say somethin wrong"
I didn't have the courage to say
But then I thought

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS 2]
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said "no more please"
What about those things
What about that, what about that
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that, what about that

Don't wanna live my life
In misery
Don't tell me you did it cuz you love me
I don't believe

I'm sick and tired
Your deceptive games
Wonder where you have been
I can't live life wonderin

My heart was poundin
But the time had come
To stop lettin my whisperin heart control me
And tellin my screamin mind what to do
I looked him straight in the eyes and then I said

[CHORUS + CHORUS 2 2x]
