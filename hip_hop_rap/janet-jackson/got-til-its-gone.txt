[JANET:]
Oh yeah

Uh-uh like Joni says...

[JONI]
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's--
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's--
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's--
You don't know what you've got 'til it's--

[JANET:]
Gone

Have a feelin
Now believin
That you were the one
I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishin
Thinkin dreamin
Bout you
And the love
How'd I ever let you get away

Got 'til it's gone

[JONI:]
Don't- don't- don't it always--, 
Don't- don't- don't it always--

[JANET:]
Got 'til it's gone

Joni Mitchell never lies
[JONI:]
You don't know what you've got 'til it's
[JANET:]
Gone

If I could turn back
The hands of time I'd make you
Fall in love
In love with me again

So would you give me
Another chance to love
To love you
In the right way no games

Got 'til it's gone
[JONI:]
Don't- don't- don't it always--, Don't- don't- don't it always--

[Q-TIP:]
Now you're realizin when the nights go long right
Campaign for me stay when you know that I'm gone right
You act all wild when I tell you to settle
I was workin round the clock but your girls wanna meddle
Talkin bout, "I heard he swims with this chick on the beach."
That was out with the tide but my love you impeached
Now you lookin at the walls head in hand cold Jonezin
Ringin my house, hangin up, and then posin
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that and do that
