You're feelin' in it
You're ticklin' it
You're swimming in it
You're gonna get it

I'm insatiable
And it's all your fault
So much lust involved
To get me off
My water falls

Your sexuality breeds
A storm inside of me seas
A touch is all I need
To make me scream
Obscenities

Every time you whisper in my ear I get aroused
You begin to slowly unbutton my blouse
Kissing on my skin my heart's racing now

I want you boy

Caught up in the waves of passion up and down
Love the way you movin?my body all around
Boy you 'bout to make the rain come down

[Chorus]

Feel my rain come
Pouring soaking
Longing your lips
Baby ooh

You make it so moist

When my ocean's overflowing
Afterglowing
Take me oooh

You make me so moist

Orgasmic
Row it just like that
Hope you like drowning in it
You won't have a life jacket

My thirst is quenched
Ooh baby we're so drenched
Our body's rhythms are
So cataclysmic
Got me twisted

Feeling your anatomy breaking me down
Sucking on my mmm with ice in your mouth
Hurry and undress me take me right now
I'm wet for you boy
Caught up in the waves of passion up and down
Love the way you movin?my body all around

Boy you know you make the rain come down
You know how to make my rain come down

[Chorus]

[4x]
You're feelin' in it
You're ticklin' it
You're swimming in it
You're gonna get it
Moist

[Vamp chorus]
