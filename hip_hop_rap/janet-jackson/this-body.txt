Saw the cover
The finest girl that you've ever seen
Just had to buy me
Had to try me
Oooh You're in love with
The hottest girl in the magazine
You do whatever to have me all to yourself
I know you can't stop lookin'
So don't try to deny it
Baby I can see in your eyes
You do anything if I let you inside me
What would you do if I came to life?
Let me tell ya

This body of mine
This body of mine
Boy I'm trying to warn you bout
This body of mine
This body of mine
You'll go crazy when you see me see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around

Now we're at your home
Lead the way to your room
What you're lookin' for
Is right on page 52
You see what you like
Reading bout what I like
When I'mm all alone in the zone with a man
Now would you be ready if I stepped off these pages
And told you that that man was you
Or would you turn out to have some great conversation
But didn't know what to do
Once you got a look at

This body of mine
This body of mine
Boy I'm trying to warn you bout
This body of mine
This body of mine
You'll go crazy when you see me see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around

Now I was walking
Through the airport
Stopped at the gift shop
Saw this girl on the cover
Actually made a ***** jaw drop
Man she was F I N E head to toe
Six page spread
Baddest thang I ever seen befo
Stuck in the store dreaming
Can't even get to the register
Girl behind the counter
Talking but I'm like the hell with her
Cause I swear I deserve this girl
Talking to the pages
Telling me what she like
And how she like it
In different places
What she eat to keep her body tight
Definition of Mr. Right
I fit that description to the T
To the T
All the s*** that she don't like
Live for a late night
It sound like she's talking right to me
Especially when she said

I know you can't stop lookin' So don't try to deny it
Baby I can see in your eyes
You do anything if I let you inside me
What would u do if I came to life?
Let me tell ya

This body of mine
This body of mine
Boy I'm trying to warn you bout
This body of mine
This body of mine
You'll go crazy when you see me see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
