[Janet]
Making love in the rain, I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone, I hear the rain on my window

[Lisa]
It's just a little thing, but it means so much to me
Our bodies together, while the rain plays a melody

[Janet] Every raindrop makes me think of you
[Lisa:] Wishing you were close to me
There is nothing that I'd rather do 

[Both]
Than

[Janet]
Making love in the rain, I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone, I hear the rain on my window 

[Lisa]
When it's stormy outside, it's calm in my heart, with you in my arms
And when you're away from me, I wish it would rain 'cause it's always 
the same

[Janet]
Every raindrop makes me think of you
[Lisa:] Wishing you were close to me
There is nothing that I'd rather do 
[Lisa:] Rather do

[Both]
Than

[Janet]
Making love in the rain, I can't believe the joy it brings me
[Lisa:] I can't believe
And when I'm all alone, I hear the rain on my window
[Lisa:] On my window

[Janet]
Every raindrop makes me think of you
[Lisa:] Wishing you were close to me
There is nothing [Lisa:] Nothing that I'd rather do than 
[Lisa:] That I'd rather do than

[Janet]
Making love in the rain, I can't believe the joy it brings me
[Lisa:] Oh, oh making love
And when I'm all alone 
[Lisa:] All alone, I hear the rain on my window
[Lisa:] On my window, I hear it rain, yeah

[Janet]
Making love in the rain, I can't believe the joy it brings me

[Lisa]
Ooh, ooh ooh yeah
All alone, I hear the rain, I hear the rain
Oh, oh, oh
Oh no here comes the rain
Oh no here comes the rain
Oh no here comes the rain
Oh no here comes the rain
