As a child I missed a lot of love I never had 
And daddy he was distant 
Never there to hold my hand 
Never bought the things he'd always promise to give me 
Mother made up for him always watching over me 
Days would go by and we would never see his face 
In my mind I'd wonder "Does he have another place" 
If and when he'd come in he would always be upset 
All the kids were scared his next syndrome would be a fret 

Now that you are older and you begin to see 
Family's important to be there if you need 
Father never taught us these things mom said to me 
Now the table's turned so tell me you need me 

Tell me 
Tell me 
Tell me 
Just to me 
You need me 

Daddy daddy dearest, what is it you want from me 
Tell me 
I won't turn my back on you the way you did with me 
Now you try to give and always faking not to cry 
I'll give you what I can but I can't give what I don't have
Mother lends a shoulder, to cry on if you need
But are you there for mother when she needs your company

Father never taught us, these things mom said to me 
Now the table's turned so tell me 
You need me 

Tell me 
Tell me 
Tell me 
Tell me 
Say 
You need me 

If you realize we need each other, we will be a closer family. 
I need you, yeah 
I need you, and you know that 
Say 
You need me 

Now that you are older and you begin to see 
Family's important to be there if you need 
Father never taught us, no no never taught us 
Just to me 
You need me 

Tell me that you need me 
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you need me 
Just to me 
Say 
You need me 

Now that you are older and you begin to see 
Family's important to be there if you need 
Father never taught us these things mom said to me 
Now the table's turned so tell me you need me 

Tell me 
Tell me 
Tell me 
Just to me 
You need me 

Mother lends a shoulder to cry on if you need 
But are you there for mother when she needs your company 
Are you there for mother 
Are you there for mother 
Are you there for mother 
Father never taught us these things mom said to me 
Just to me 
You need me
