Aaah you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin like a ferris wheel
Aaah you turn me upside down with my feelin
And I know the reason 
Baby your love is surreal
You make me go, you make go, you make me go
Make me go
You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster

There's a high level of love goin on
The fellins are just way too strong
The reason that you got me gone
Is baby cause you turn me on
With a bit of it more than a little bit
I addicted every time get a hit os it
Cause oh baby you take me so high
When i'm on your rollercoaster ride

I'm in and out of luv
And it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused
Don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

Boy you give me butterflies
So deep inside
Breaks me down when I look in those eyes
Takes me out way across the sky
Baby boy I won't lie
Usually I'm not this shy
You do it to me every time
I get on your rollercoaster ride

Cause you make me go up and down
And around and around and
I can't take it
You make me go up and down
And around and around 
That's why boy I can't take it
