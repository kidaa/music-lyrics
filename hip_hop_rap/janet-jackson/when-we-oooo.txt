Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 

Hello my love 
Wish you were here 
So many things in my heart 
That I'd like to share 
A few warm thoughts 
A stuble smile 
Our conversation through silence 
Could last all night 

At ease my mind 
To see your face 
Those sexy eyes could calm 
A heart of rage 
You speak my name 
I touch your hand 
The chemistry only true love could understand 

You've opened my soul to happiness 
And shown me new ways of love 
Smooth is life's travels with you beside me 
I'll never walk alone 

Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 

You give of you 
All you can give 
You've taught me love laugh 
you've taught me to live 
At rainbow's end 
That pot of gold 
Can't hold a light to you 
'cause you're my heart and soul 

Such passionate love that we make 
In time our bodies are one 
When loving's done the passions still strong 
'cause spiritually we are as one 

Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When I oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 

Such passionate love that we make 
In time our bodies are one 
When loving's done the passions still strong 
'cause spiritually we are as one 

Can't get enough of you baby 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When I oooo 
Can't get enough of you 
When we oooo 
Can't get enough of you
