People gather 'round
At the Lennox Lounge
To hear the funky sounds
The beat hits so hard
There's no cover charge
You have to feel the groove

[CHORUS:]
One thing is you've got to be real
If you want to hear the
Funky big band
He who knows it feels it
Got to be real
If you want to hear the
Funky big band
We who knows it feel it

Harlem is the place
Where you'll find the face
Of those who feel the groove
It's not taught to thee
But it's born to we
Aw and I feel the groove

[CHORUS]

And the band plays
From the big band
And the band plays
From the big band

It's funky
You feel it
It's funky
To be real
It's funky
You feel it
Oh it's funky
To be real

[CHORUS]

We who know it feel it [4x]
