You tell me you love me 
You tell me you care 
But when I'm around you 
It's like I'm not there 
I need a reminder 
Something can see 
Something on my finger 
Shining so brightly 

Don't you know 
Diamonds are a girls' best friend
When you go 
They stay with me until the end
Don't you know 
Diamonds are a girls' best - best friend
When you go 
They stay with me until the end 

Don't want your money 
Don't want your key 
Diamonds 
Love don't come for free 
Don't want your money 
Don't want your key 
Diamonds 
Love don't come for free 

You sent me some roses 
But roses do die 
You gave me some candy 
It melted - nice try 
I'm not that demanding 
I have simple taste 
I just want a token 
That can't go to waste 
Diamonds 

Don't you know 
Diamonds are a girls' best friend 
When you go 
They stay with me until the end 
Don't you know 
Diamonds are a girls' best - best friend 
When you go 
They stay with me until the end
