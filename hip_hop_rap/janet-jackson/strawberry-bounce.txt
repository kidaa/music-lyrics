[Chorus 1]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la [repeat]
I like to make it
You know I'll make it
Now can you take it

Ooh baby
Let me be your playground
Push it out and catch it on the rebound
Turn it out swinging from this pole
I'mma make you
Lose control

Gyrate then spin it like a yo-yo
Slap the back & jiggle it like jell-o
Honey if you came for a show
I'mma make you
Lose control

[Chorus 2]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la [repeat]
Up and down baby
You know I like to make it
Now can you take it

Bump the beat
Just watch the way I pump it
The way I work it gonna keep you cumin'
Do a dance that's so sexual
I'mma make you
Lose control

Don't trip
You know you wanna watch this
I'm a pro you won't be disappointed
Gonna leave you beggin' for more
I'mma make you
Lose control

La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la [repeat]
I like to make it
U know I'll make it
Now can you take it
Lose control

La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la [repeat]
Up & down baby
You know I like to make it
I like to make it
Lose control

[Bridge]

Ew wee baby
My lips as sweet as honey
When I put 'em in your face
Gonna make you spend ya' money
Uh-huh
Come on or you're gonna miss it
Ring ring don't you wanna kiss it

Watchin' me
Do a dance
Makin' you so horny
If you want a little taste
Gotta show me how much you want

I'm bout to
Pop it
Bounce, Bounce
Clap, Clap
You like dat?!!

I did a tease to bring you to yo' knees baby
Broke you down
Made you feel sleezy
Then you said...
"Fine muthafucka, I like it"

I did a tease
To bring you to yo' knees baby
Now you know that pimpin' ain't easy
Then you said
"Fine muthafucka, I like it
