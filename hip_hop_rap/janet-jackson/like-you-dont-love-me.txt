[Verse 1:]
I saw your manhood rising
Cause you were fantasizing
I guess that model in the lingerie got you excited
That night crawled into bed 
Wearing that same teddy bear
You only said I love you
Kissed me then rolled over and slept 

[Hook:]
Damn is that all I get from you
'Bout to give me an attitude
You need to make love to me 
Like you don't love me then 

Don't have to be gentle tonight
Just an animal tonight
You need to make love to me 
Like you don't love me 

[Hook 2:]
Just do me, baby 
Come on an drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls 

Do me, baby 
Come on an drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls 

[Verse 2:]
Why you go tellin' your boys
How you been breaking me off
Must be somebody else who's back you broke
Cause I didn't get none 

You're up at 3 in the morn 
Watchin' that triple x porn
But you're so tired when you make love to me
What did you learn? 

[Repeat Hook 1]

[Repeat Hook 2]

Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do me, baby
Do me, baby
That's right, come on
Do it like this baby 

[Repeat Hook 2]
