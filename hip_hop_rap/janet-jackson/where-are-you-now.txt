Love
My love
I regret the day you went away
I was too young
To understand my love
But now I realize my mistakes

[CHORUS:]
Where
Where are you now
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
Where are you now
Do you still think of me
Or does your heart belong to someone else's

Love
Oh my love
Wonder sometimes were you just a dream
I sit in the dark
Wondering if our paths
Will ever cross again
Oh lord I need to know
I sit and wonder

[CHORUS]

If I close my eyes
And make a wish
When they open will you be right here with me
Where are you now
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then

Could it be
That two people
Were meant to be
In my dreams
That's what I feel
Or could it be that I'll never see you again
My love that was so true
Still I'll sit here waiting all alone
By the phone for you

Now I understand
now I understand
When you said I love you
I sit and wonder

[CHORUS 2x]
