[Janet]
I don't know if I've ever felt like this before
But I'm sure that the way I feel, I don't want it to go
'Cuz I've cried my share of tears
And I've sang my share of blues
But to keep you over here, I'll do what I got to do

[Janet]
So baby, call on me
Whether day or night, I'll never leave
[Nelly]
See you don't have to be alone
I'll come anywhere you want
Baby just pick up the phone and call on me
[Both]
So you ain't know
I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go

[Nelly]
See I never met a girl that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime that she's around
I be posted, waitin' on standby
Lookin' to catch the hint
I'm doin' whatever, whenever
Never forget I said I'd be here when you want
To get what you need, if you wanna recieve
Oh, please believe you could

[Janet]
