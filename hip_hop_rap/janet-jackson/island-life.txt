Come into this sacred and erotic dream
It's a world I know you wanna share
Baby, let's indulge in things that set our bodies free
Promise me that you will meet me there

[Pre-Chorus]
What better way then to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds
From the DJ

[Chorus:]
Island in the sun
Just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song
I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

[Verse 2:]
Close my eyes and there you are in front of me
Takin' me to where I wanna go
Baby, from my little shop of curiosities
Boy I'll show you all you need to know
Come on baby

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
What a better way
Then to wind down
On the streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds
From the DJ
Damn I think he's spinning this one for me

[Chorus:]
Island in the sun
Just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song
I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

[Pre-Chorus 3:]
What a better way
Then to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds
From the DJ
Damn I think he's spinning this one for me
This ones for me

[2x Chorus:]
Island in the sun
Just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

[Outro:]
Island life sunshine and paradise
All night I wanna give it to you
Island life sunshine and paradise
Every night I'm gonna give it to you
Gimme the high life
Island life sunshine and paradise
All night I wanna give it to you
Gimme the good life
Island life sunshine and paradise
Every night I'm gonna give it to you
Gimme the high life
Gimme the good life
