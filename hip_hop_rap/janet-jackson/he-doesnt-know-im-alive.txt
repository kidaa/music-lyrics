Cha
No no
No no no no no
Ooh baby

I've got his picture
It's on my dresser
Right next to my bed
He doesn't know me
But I sure know him
I can't get him out of my head, no

Talk to him
No no
I haven't even tried

He doesn't even know that I'm alive, no
He doesn't even know that I'm alive

I got his number
I call him up, hehe
Just to hear him say "Hello"
And when he answers
I always hang up
Ooh, that boy scares me so, woah

Talk to him
No no I haven't even tried

He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
No-oh
No no no no
Oohhh yeah
No no yeah

Someday I'll find the nerve
To talk to him and stop acting so preserved
I told myself "Girl you gotta change"
'Cause nothing ventured is nothing gained
No-oh woah

Late last evening
I dropped on by
Just to see if he was home
And when he opened the door
I could have died
There we were all alone
Talk to him
I said "Excuse me I thought my friend lived here"

Well he doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know
He doesn't know
Ooh
I'm alive

No no, no no
No
No no, no no
Ah!
No no, no no
Ooh ooh yeah, no woah
La la la la la la la la lah
