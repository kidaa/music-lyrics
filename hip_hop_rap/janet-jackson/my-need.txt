[CHORUS:]
My love
My need
Tonight
I feel so tight
My love
My need
Tonight
Just how I like

I know
You know
What exactly's on my mind

I can't help
Myself
Part of how I feel tonight

Won't make
Excuses
I just want you inside baby

We don't
Need to
Talk about no promises

[CHORUS]

Let just
Pretend
That we have no more tomorrow

Can't we
Make love
Like it's our last time baby

Let's not
Get too
Soft and gentle

Am not
Feelin
In no mood to play around

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
I need you
Like the blues needs the pain
I need you
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]

My love
My love
My love
My love

[BRIDGE]
