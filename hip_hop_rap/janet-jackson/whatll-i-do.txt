What'll I do
For satisfaction
Honey who'll take
Care of me now
If you leave
I can't make it
Darlin please
Don't you put me down
Cause what'll I do
For satisfaction
If you take
Away your heart
What'll I do
For satisfaction
When that funny
Funny feelin's gone
Oh what'll I do

I can't take no more
Of missin you
I don't know just what
I'm gonna do
How can I
Love another
You don't know just what you mean to me

What'll I do
For satisfaction
If you take away
Away your heart
What'll I do
For satisfaction
When my nights start to gettin long

Oh no no
Boy I love ya
Wanna hold ya

Your love's strong
That's no lie
And I hate
I hate to put it down
But if you
If you leave me now
You won't want
Want me hangin around

Cause what'll I do
For satisfaction
If you take away
Away your heart
What'll I do
For satisfaction
When that funny
Funny feelin's gone
Oh I need you now

What'll I do baby
What'll I do baby
What'll I do baby
What'll I do baby
Say na na na
Whoo!
Ooh

Hey hey hey
That's what I say
Hey hey hey
That's what I say
What'll I do...
