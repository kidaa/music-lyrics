Feels like going in circles
You're like a maze I can't get through
Should I go left should I go right
Should I let you stay for the night 
It's like a see-saw when it comes to your love
Boy when you're up this girl is down and I just can't figure it out

[Chorus:]
Cause you know that I want ya
And you know that I need ya
Is that any way to be 
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin
These tears can you wipe'em
Is that any way to be 
Jus have your way with me

I'm goin out with guys I don't wanna go
Places that I've been before
they pitchen the same game
Boy it's a dam shame
how I wish it was you callin' me
I want it to be you holdin' me
boy it needs to be you kissin me

Cause it's like a see-saw when it comes to your love 
Boy when you're up 
This girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
have your way have your way with me
Anytime anywhere
However I don't care
Have your way with me
Cause tonight
Boy tonight
Tonight................

[Chorus]

[Ad libs]
Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Huh huh huh
My body is cryin
These tears can you wipe them
Is it any way to be 
Baby have your way with with me
Cause you know that I want ya baby
And you know that I need ya baby
In my life I need you
I want you 
Right here
Cryin for you baby
Boo hoo hoo hoo
Boo hoo hoo hoo
Shoo doop doo doop doop do doooooo
