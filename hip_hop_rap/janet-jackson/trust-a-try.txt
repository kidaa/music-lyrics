Trust not an east thing you say
Never thought the game of love
This way you'd play
By the things you do
Never thought these things
I would go through with you
Pain trickery and deceit
All the wrongs that you put me through
If you don't wanna say
Still love you anyway
Never do believe my words
When I try telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No I'm not a cheat or a liar

She brought love
She brought joy
She brought what she brought
You thought you'd never see again
She cheats and lied
Made you cry
Said goodbye
Bodies numb

Think you're never gonna feel again
Then what do you know
You take it slow
Here comes
Things go smooth
But dreams just around bend
Don't blame me for jealousies
Or insecurities
Please see
Cause I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with misery
Accusing me of polygamy
If not the trust then we have what
Gotta be strong oh keep holding on_

Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past 
She hurt you bad
Let's start anew
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong with this love
Hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try

You got burned
You got bruised 
You got
So you got a kick outta that
Unhealthy shit
You said to she 
You'd please her needs 
Whatever it'd be
Still she'd cheat
On her back again for the money

Now leave from it
You grow from it
Get over it
I won't take the blame
So don't 
Cause I ain't having it
Steady given me
The third degree
That's so mean
Don't push me out the door
I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with misery
Accusing me of polygamy
If not the trust then we have what
Gotta be strong oh keep holding on_

Wanna second chance with this love
