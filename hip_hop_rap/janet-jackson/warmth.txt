Pull over
Let me do all the work

[Chorus]
My hands wrapped around
Stroking up and down
But nothing can compare to
The warmth of my mouth

I love every sound you make
When I'm down
Nothing can prepare you for
The Warmth of my

[Verse 1]
Mouth against your mouth
Getting you aroused
Whisper in your ear
I think I'll take it further south

Kissing on your neck
Rubbing on your leg
Slide a little further up
I feel you get erect

And now we're flesh against flesh
Breathing on your chest
So anxious to touch it
My mouth is getting wet

Just like the water from the shore
Let your rain pour
Baby brace yourself for

[Chorus 2]
My hands wrapped around
Stroking up and down let's see how long you can last inside
But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth

I love every sound you make
When I'm down Just hear the water splash about
But nothing can prepare you for
The warmth of my mouth

No place warmer than my mouth....

[Bridge]
Start off slow
Circles
Then deeper and deep it goes
Kisses so sensual
Tasteful
I love giving you a show

The warmth of my...

Do you like that?

Now it's my turn
