When I first met you
I swear that I was straight with you
I wasn't looking for nobody new
I just needed someone to talk to
You said you were cool and understood
But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
And you sitting there with a broken heart
Cause I gave you my body and not my heart

[Chorus]
When I'm holding you late at night
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
When I'm kissing you and look at you
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

[Verse 2]
Baby I have to be
Unselfish and true to me
Cause I'm not where I really want to be
And It's nothing with you
It's all me
I toss and turn all night when I sleep
Want and reaching for someone who use to be
Said it must be some karma thing
Cause I can't seem to let go and love again

[Chorus 2]
When I lay with you I close my eyes
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm touching you gently
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
When I'm listing to music I'm thinking' 'bout my ex
In a bubble bath with the candles lit
I'm thinking 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

[Bridge]

You're beautiful
I don't wanna take the space from someone else
So let me go
And do a little soul searchin' for myself
I'm so sorry that
I pulled you in and let it get this far
You know I never meant to break your heart

[Chorus 3]
At the shopping mall or movies
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
At the restaurant while I'm eating
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
While you talk to me I drift away
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When you ask me what I'm thinkin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

[Repeat till fade]

You know it's not who you think it is
