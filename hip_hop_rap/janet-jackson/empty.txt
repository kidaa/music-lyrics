How could it be that you know me
My deepest fears my fantasies
Confide in you what no one knows
But it feels so real

[CHORUS:]
when I close my eyes
I can see your face
when I lick my lips
I can taste your smile
when I see your name
My heart starts to race
if I can't read your thoughts
Then I feel empty
when I close my eyes
I feel empty
when I close my eyes
I feel empty
when I close my eyes
Whoa I feel empty
when I close my eyes

Is this a new way to love
Never face to face is it enough
Does it really count or am I a fool
So tell me please, am I wasting my time

Your phrases
Descriptive
And through the textured words

With beauty
You post it
And use such colored verbs
We've never met
Ooh

[CHORUS]

I'm rushin home to turn you on
Sometimes you're there sometimes you're gone
Wait for hours for your return
So tell me please, am I wasting my time

Your phrases
Descriptive
And through the textured words

With beauty
You post it
And use such colored verbs

So tell me you think that maybe we've gone insane
To find a, a lover and through the words of pain
We've never met
Ooh

[CHORUS]

When I lick my lips
I can taste your smile
My heart starts to race
I can taste your smile

[CHORUS]

when I close my eyes
when I close my eyes
when I close my eyes
when I close my eyes

Damn, Disconnected
