I...cause I wanna sexplore you
I...put my hands up on you babe
I...wanna feel ur sexplosion
I.. and I'm gonna take you on a sexcapade

[Chorus]
I don't have to figure out
What you are all about
Just to turn you out...oh

Give it to you
Sexhibition
Never missing
What your wishing
I'll drive that ass crazy

It's so sensual
Incredible
Just let Damita Jo...oh

What your wishing
Sexhibition
If you listen
We'll be drippin?
I'll drop that ass

I...Feel the sexsation
I...Feel the pulse and vibration babe
I...Wanna little tastetation babe
I...No need for a sexplanation

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
There's nothing worse than a man out of touch
Let's fix this distance now between the two of us
So tempting
But you never knew I wanted you so much
So much

[Chorus 2x]

Relax
It's just sex
