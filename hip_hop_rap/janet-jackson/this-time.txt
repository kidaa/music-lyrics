After all I've done for you

[CHORUS:]
This time
I'm not gonna stay
This time
I must get away
This time
You've gone too far
yeah yeah
This time
I'm not gonna stay
This time
You've got to pay
This time
You've gone too far

You runnin 'round
With those nasty hoes
How long did ya think I could take this
You said to me
That's the way life goes
How long did ya think I could take this

I should have known
Haa you weren't for real
But my love for you kept on strong
You better know
You're gonna miss my love
Now you know that I'm not still holdin on
That's right
All of my friends say

[CHORUS]

You've played the game
But you played yourself
Oh boy take a look at who's sorry now
You're not the same
Oh how you have changed
So now look at you
It's a damn shame

I don't care if I
Never ever see your face again
You broke my heart one too many times, oh
You think that I'm
I'm just not that strong
My bags are packed
Watch me walk right through that door

[CHORUS]

Walkin 'round with nasty hoes
Tellin me that's the way life goes
No, baby
Way too far
Said to me that I'm not that strong
Watch me walk right through that door
Hooh hoo yeah yeah

[CHORUS 2x]

Aw gone too far
Aw gone too far
Aw gone too far gone too far gone too far

[CHORUS]

You're dismissed
