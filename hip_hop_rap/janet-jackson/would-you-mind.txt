Baby would you mind touching me
Ever so slowly
You're making me quiver
Baby would you mind undressing me
Making me feel sexy
While in the moment

[chorus:]
Cause I'm gonna
Bathe you, play with you, rub you, caress you
Tell how much I've missed you
I just wanna
Touch you, tease you, lick you, please you
Love you, hold you, make love to you
And I'm gonna 
Kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you
Feel you, make you come too

Baby would you mind kissing me
All over my body
You misseed a spot - there
Baby would you mind tasting me
It's making me all juicy
Feeling your lips on mine

[chorus]

Baby would you mind coming inside of me
Letting your juices free
Deep in my passion

[chorus]
