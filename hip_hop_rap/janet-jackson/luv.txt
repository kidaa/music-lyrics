I've been down this road before
I know it very well
And I just can't believe 
I've been struck
I didn't see it comin'
I was blindfolded
I'm caught up in collision
And now I'm so done
You crept up like a spider
I got caught in your web
There was no way to escape
I tried to switch my lanes
But then I hit my brakes
Sparks turned into flames
I shoulda stopped 
At the red light 'cause

Now I'm like a deer 
Caught in headlights
Ugh, he hit me with his love 
Love, love, love, love
He hit me with his love
And now I'm in love, love, love, love
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics love
He hit me with his love 
Love, love, love

I was creepin' the road
Just knew I had control
So how did I end up gettin' hit
I had on my belt
I checked it myself
So how in the world 
Did I get caught
I had the right of way
I saw the sign you disobeyed
It was your fault
I can't believe the way 
You wrecked into my heart
I think I should sue ya
I shoulda stopped 
At the red light 'cause

Now I'm like a deer 
Caught in headlights
Ugh, he hit me with his love 
Love, love, love, love
He hit me with his love
And now I'm in love 
Love, love, love
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics love
He hit me with his love 
Love, love, love

You caught me by surprise
I can't believe 
That I'm falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops 
'Cause I'm falling for that guy
You caught me by surprise
I can't believe 
That I'm falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops 
'Cause I'm falling for that guy

I shoulda stopped 
At the red light 'cause

Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights
Ugh, he hit me with his love, love, love, love, love
He hit me with his love
And now I'm in love, love, love, love
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics love
He hit me with his love

He crashed into my heart
He crashed into my heart
Somebody call the paramedics love
He hit me with his love
He crashed into my heart
He crashed into my heart
Somebody call the paramedics love
He hit me with his love, love, love, love, love
