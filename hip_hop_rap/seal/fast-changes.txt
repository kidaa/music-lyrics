Maybe if I search my mind a little,
I'd come across the reason why you're gone.
Maybe if I searched a little while.
And if I try to reconcile a little,
Then maybe I will know for how long.
This time...
Well here we are,
in separate rooms.
I can hear you sighing.
Saying "No way out" or so it seems.
Dry our tears, we're flying straight on through that window.
Fast changes arriving.
Slow changes are moving out.
Here we are.
Now maybe if I took the time a little,
Then maybe I would know for how long.
This time.
Here we are,
In separate rooms.
I can hear you sighing.
Saying "No way out" or so it seems.
Dry our tears, we're flying straight on through that window.
