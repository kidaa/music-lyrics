See the curtains hanging in the window
  In the evening on a Friday night
  A little light a shinin' through the window
  Lets me know everything is all right

  Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
  Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind<  See the paper laying on the sidewalk
  A little music from the house next door
  So I walk on up to the doorstep
  Through the screen and across the floor  Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
  Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

  Sweet days of summer, the jasmines in bloom
  July is dressed up and playing her tune.
  And I come home from a hard days work
  And you're waiting there not a care in the world

  See the smile waitin in the kitchen
  Food cooking and plates for two
  Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
  In the evening when the day is through

  Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

  Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
