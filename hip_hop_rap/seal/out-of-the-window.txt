I met an angel,
I was so petrified.
And through the angel,
I saw the essence of life.
But she's gone now.
Yeah she's gone now.
Still I go on.
I walk the main street, 
With a cloak over me.
She bears her soul,
For all in suffering to see.
But she's gone now,
Yeah she's gone now.
And I stare...
Out of the window, 
I see trouble, I see all that is wrong.
Out of the window, 
I see war and I think what's going on.
Out of the window, 
There's a fight involving all my friends.
Out of the window... 
Out of captivity,
And into the arms of peace.
For their comfort and love. 
For when love comes,
And everything goes with it.
Like the calm before the storm.
Be she's gone now.
Yeah she's gone now.
Still I stare...
Out of the window,
I see trouble, I see all that is wrong.
Out of the window,
I see war and I think what's going on.
Out of the window,
There's a fight involving all my friends.
Out of the window...
Through that window.
And it hurts like hell, yeah.
You've been gone a long time,
Left your keys but you didn't leave no trace.
If that means you need time honey,
Then take time,
Ho lord... Oh lord.
Now I regret it,
Baby only I know what you need.
I'll be the one there kissing you off,
When you leave...
Yeah,
Looking though my window.
Yeah.
Out of my window.
Out of my window.
I'm looking though my window.
Through my window,
It looks like pain....... yeah, na-na-now.
...pain... yeah, na-na-now.
It feels like pain...yeah...yeah...yeah.
