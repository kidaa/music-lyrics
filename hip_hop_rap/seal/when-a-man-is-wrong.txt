The perils of loneliness
The pleasures of love
That we find
The arguement's immenent
The look on her face
As we cry
There's nothing when you fall alone
There's hate when you fall by the side
You know that I didn't mean to hurt you love
I just need some light
On my life
But when a man is wrong
Facing all the mistakes
That he's done
There can be no right
Now if I was a holy man
And you were the devil in a song
And if I liked what you played
Does that mean you're right and I'm wrong
Know there's danger in serenade, my friend
There's even love if you find what you want
And there's reason to be afraid
And reason to open your heart
But when a man is wrong
Facing all the mistakes
That he's done
There can be no right
Oh my friend
I sometimes get things wrong to get things right
Oh my friend
You know I sometimes get things wrong to get things right
Oh my friend
When a man is wrong
Facing all the mistakes that are done
When a man, when this man is wrong
There can be no right
There can be no right
