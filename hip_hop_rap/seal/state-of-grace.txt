So strange
It's funny how
We came to meet
Those eyes uncanny
Were my invitation
I couldn't wait
I couldn't wait
To hold you like a baby
Is this what it feels like
You are here now
Oh but I
Can't seem to find our state of grace
Who knows tomorrow may never come
One touch, one look that is all it takes
These things forever change us
This is the sound of a feeling that's caught in my head
Makes me think about something you said
To take away my fears
Ohh I
This is the sound of a woken man
Why don't you tell me its you babe
I found you 
You babe
Oh but I 
Can't seem to find that state of grace
Who knows tomorrow may never come
One touch, one look that is all it takes
These things forever change us
Look at the past
No savoir faire
No that's not us
Oh but I
I can't seem to find my state of grace
Who knows tomorrow may never come
One touch, one look that is all it takes
These things forever change us
These things forever change us
These things
Look at the past
These things
No savoir fair
These things
I know that are ours 
These things
Look at the past
Whoaa ohhh oohh ohhhhhh ohhh oohhh ohhha 
Whoaa ohhh oohh ohhhhhh ohhh oohhh ohhha 
Aaaahha
These things
Look at the past
