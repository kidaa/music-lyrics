Come into the mornin' sun,
And take a look what love has done,
Oh what love has done.
As I sing into a dream come true,
I see what's there for me and you,
For me and you.
As we ride,
On the strings of life and Technicolor.
Look over there,
In the sky,
You and I,
Forget about the hate that made those wars.
We fly free unscathed,
And I know,
That one fine day our sun will shine.
Sun will shine.
So walk into the writhin' sun,
And take a look what love has done.
What love has done.
I fear the dark,
I face the dawn,
And see what I once needed.
So why can't I hold on to my ideas

I believe in raw force,
And I believe in love for all,
I believe that'll never come,
We will find it.
We're gonna find it.
So walk into the risin' sun.
And take a look what love has done.
Lo-oo-o-oo-ove has done
