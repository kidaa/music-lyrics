One two 
One two three four 
I'll kiss that away 

Both of them swam from a northern blue sky 
Smile on their faces they entered their doom like they knew 
If their world should end they won't care about that anyway 

I jade the water and I burn the fire 
Ooh I burn the fire 

Nuclear chemicals making their doom like you knew, 
If the world should end you won't care about that anyway. 
Maybe thats the way you live your life but I know, 
Life it don't always live that way. 

Jade, 
A shade of pain and then we die. 
Jade, 
A shade of pain and then we die. 
Jade, 
A shade of pain and then we die. 
But it's just the way 

Maybe that's the way you live you life but I know 
Life, you see it don't always live that way 

Jade, 
A shade of pain and then we die. 
Jade, 
A shade of pain and then we die... Oh why... 
Jade, 
A shade of pain and then we die. 

Maybe that's the way... 
Maybe that's the way, but it don't always live that way 

Now that I understand the beauty of what they've left to hand me down. 
When you need a place to live and no one understands you. 
And all you want to do. 
Is to cry out loud. 
But you don't know how. 
No way, no-one, 
No-one understands. 
The hand that strikes. 
When just a touch of love is all the problem needed, 
And when you hurt someone so much that still they die loving you. 
And all you want to do, 
Is to cry out loud. 
But you don't know how, 
Jade... 

Jade 
A shade of pain and then the memory dies. 
Jade 

Ohh no no and then, and then we die die... die, die... 
A shade of pain and then we die 

Jade... 
But you don't know how, 

Until you try some how, 
Jade... 
Like you don't know how 
Jade... 

But you'll try somehow. 
Jade. 
And then we die. 

We will find a way, 
Letting the sun go down. 
Maybe we'll find a way, 
Holding the sun. 
We will find a way, 
Letting our life go by. 

I tell you we'll find a way, 

Holding the sun 
The sun...
