Manic Depression is touching my soul.
I know what I want but I just don't know... how to go about getting it.
Feelings sweet feeling, drops from my fingers... fingers.
Manic Depression has captured my soul, yah.
Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain.. vain
You make love you break love and it all seems the same, when it's over
Music, sweet music, I wish I could caress.. all my tenderness
Now manic depressions's a frustrating mess
Ow
Oooooo Ooooooo
Oooooo Yaaaaaa
Well, I think I will turn myself off and then I'll go down, down, down
Really ain't no use in me hangin' around...eh...eh
Music, sweet music, I wish I could caress, in all my tenderness
Manic Depression is a frustrating mess
Yeah.. Hooooaa

Music, sweet music
Sweet music, sweet music
Sweet music sweet music
Sweet music

Oh yah

She's so will'n
She's the cause of my pain.. my pain
We make love, we break love, we
But, somehow it all seems to be the same
Well, I've been in love that simple before
Yah, you know
I don't ever want to do it again, yah
So now, I really got to tell you how I feel
Ohhhh
