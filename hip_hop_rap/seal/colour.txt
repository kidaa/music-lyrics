Colour fades away
With a light descending on the day
Midnight sees your friend
Oh could you call his name
Would you know his name
I come here for your love
But, God only knows
Colour fades away
Good times here today
Meanwhile you would say
I close my eyes
Colour fades away
Tell me who are you for anyway
Midnight is your friend
Will we see a beginning in the end
God only knows what we've put in that paint
God only knows
Colour fades away
Good times here today
Here most every day
Meanwhile you would say
I close my eyes
And dream of only yesterday
Colour fades away
Good times here today
Here most everyday
Meanwhile you would say
That I close my eyes
Colour
Fades to grey
I dream so exciting
But I, I feel so bold
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
