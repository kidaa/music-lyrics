There's no reason for you to lose your mind,
Cause I've seen something,
That's gonna change our time.
If I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, I'd make you understand.
Ah...
There's no hurry,
It's gonna come for sure,
Cause I know that someday,
We're gonna end our war.
If I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, I'd make you understand.
Yes, I'd stand, and if I...I...
If I could I would now.
Oh my baby, oh baby...
And if I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, then I'd make you understand.
There's no reason for you to lose your mind. 
Cause I've seen something that's gonna change our time. 
If I..... could if I..... could and if I..... could....

If I could I would now.
