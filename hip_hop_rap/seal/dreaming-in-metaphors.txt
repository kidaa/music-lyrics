Love serenade,
Soothe me with the morning sun.
Help me find someone,
Peaceful and non-judgemental.
Holdin' me back,
And make me feel whole with life.
And stay the same.
Life.
Without the pain.
Why must we dream in metaphors
Try to hold on to something we couldn't understand. 
Couldn't understand. 
And why must we argue loudly
When peace is our one salvation.
I couldn't understand 
Couldn't understand 
Yeah...
Ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh 
Ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh 
Someone lost their faith in, seeking God so they.
Turn to the needle, back to the cradle. They were...
Rocking it all too long.
Tell me what's going on with your life.
Has it stayed the same
Well why do we dream in metaphors
Try to hold on to something we couldn't understand. 
Couldn't understand. 
Tell me why must we argue loudly When peace is our one,
Salvation I couldn't understand 
Couldn't understand 
Yeah
Ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh ohhh...
Life will always stay the same
Life stay the same
Life will ease your pain
...life without no......pain or shame...
Why must we dream in metaphors
We're trying to hold on to something we couldn't understand. 
Couldn't understand 
Tell me why must we argue loudly when peace is our one
Salvation I couldn't understand 
Couldn't understand 
Now why must we dream in metaphors
Something that's lost

And you know I know I couldn't understand I just couldn't understand.

And you know I couldn't understand, I just couldn't understand.
