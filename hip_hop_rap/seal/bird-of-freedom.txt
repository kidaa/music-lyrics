Brother...
You can't lose that feeling,
You can't give your life away.
Like a bird of freedom,
You ain't got no dues to pay.
'Cause they need you bad,
...need you bad...
For what they never had.
...never had...
I want you to know,
...you to know...
That it's alright to flow.
...alright to flow...
Yes it alright brother.
....ooooh-oooh
Yes it alright
No-nooo.
Let your love shine brightly,
Let it burn right through my veins.
Brother...
Like that bird of freedom,
You ain't got no blues today.
Brother...
'Cause they need you bad, 
For what they never had, brother.
...never had...
I want you to know,
...you to know...
That it's alright to flow.
...alright to flow...
Baby.
Away from everywhere.
Ooo, can't you see that they want ya,
They need ya, so bad baby.
For what they never had, now.
...never had...
I want you to know,
...you to know...
That it's alright,
...alright...
No it's alright,
Alright to flow.
Alright...
Oh brother, my brother.
Away from everywhere, no na na na.
Why would I stop you
Why would I lie
Why would I break this feeling
When we're almost there.
Away from everywhere.
'Cause I wouldn't do this
Lord if I tried.
Why would I break this feeling
When we're almost there.
Away from everywhere.
'Cause not in a million,
Lord if I tried.
Why can't I have you near me
When we're almost there.
Away from everywhere.
Take to the skies and fly.....
....Why can't we have this feeling
Take to the skies and fly.....
....Why must we stop this feeling
...oooohh...
