Close your heart
Close your eyes
Fake a kiss and
Say goodbye
When you know it's not the way
And you're leaving home today
Anger rises
The deed is done
Just to say you
Can't go on
When you know that's not the way
Yet you're leaving home today
If I see a tear in your eye
It's an easy way
To say goodbye
You're afraid
So you lie
Sometime this will get you by
But you know that's not the way
And I trust you anyway
Harmony
But not for long
Plain to see
We're doing something wrong
Even though you've gone away
I still love you
But if I see a tear in your eye
It's an easy way
To say goodbye oohhh
To say goodbye oohhh whoa bye
To say goodbye
Sent you rilke
By hand
Hoping you would understand
Don't you know that's not my way
I was missing you today
Anger rises
The deed is done
Just to say that
You can't go on
When you know that's not my way
'Cause I still love you
After all we've
Said and done
Can't you see
We can't go on
'Cause God knows there's no easy way
To say goodbye
