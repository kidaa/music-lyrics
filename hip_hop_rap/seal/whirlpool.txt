She don't know woo-who
Yo' momma would-oh
Yeah ooh no no
Only child know
Only child
I wake out of a whirlpool
I walk into another day and then
I feel better
Whoa Whoa
Because you came to stay
I almost threw my life away
Thinking of what might be
If I lose
My destiny
Would I feel better than I might be
Would I see clearer than my eyes would see
Oh I if I showed I love you angel
Like a square in a circle
I try to find another way to win
I try to make better way
To the castle that I make
Where the moon lights the way
And it's invisible by day
I hear tempatation sing yeah!
Just let go and I will take you there
Now would I feel better than I might be
Would I see clearer than my eyes would see yeah
Oh I If I showed I love you angel yeah
If I fell in love with angel
If I showed I love you angel
Now would I feel better than I might be
Would I see clearer than my eyes would see yeah
Oh I If I showed I love you angel
If I took a piece of angel
If I fell in love with angel
Life is hard in a circle
Especially when you think you've gone insane
And all you get from love is lots of pain
I should have known better
Better
Better
Better
Better
Better
