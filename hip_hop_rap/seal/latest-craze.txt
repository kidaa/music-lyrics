Warmth
Security
And all that comes with it
Still you're wonderin'
How it ever felt this good
When you do it by daylight
In company
Or even by yourself
If they tell you 
It gets harder
Then somthing's right
But trust me
If you're feeling it
It gets easier by the night
When you do it in daylight
Or even sometimes in company
That's okay
But if it felt the same
A little superficial
I figure if it's good to me
It's the latest craze
The latest craze
Tell me
Father
Say that it's no good
I'm doing something
Frankly, I don't think that I should
Any fool can see
There's no guarantee
No
If they tell you
tell you
It gets harder
harder ...ohh
Then something's right
then something's right
But trust me
trust me
If you're feeling it
if you're feeling it
It gets easier by the night
when you do it...
When you do it in daylight
in daylight maybe somtimes
Or even sometimes in company
in company
That's okay
But if it felt the same
A little superficial
I figure if it's good to me
Then it's the latest craze
And if it felt the same
Yet slightly superficial
I figure if it's good to me
It's just the latest craze
It's just the latest craze
What does this mean to me
what does this mean to me
Any fool can see
any fool can see
It's just a fantasy
it's just a fantasy
Ohh yes
Not a phase
It's just the latest craze
It's the latest craze
It's the latest craze
Any fool can see
I'm doing something
Frankly, I don't think that I should
