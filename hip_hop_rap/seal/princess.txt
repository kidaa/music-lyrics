The princess and the liar
Her dress is catchin' fire
Daddy's little lemon ain't
All she's meant to be
I almost made you jump
The trust you so desire
My love is tasting bitter
'cause it almost set you free
The princess and the liar
Her dress is catchin' fire
Daddy's little lemon ain't
All she seems to me
You're heading for the crash
It'll be right here tomorrow
I'll even pay for gas
If you wreck us gracefully
The princess and the liar
Her dress is catchin' fire
Daddy's little lemon ain't
all she's meant to be
