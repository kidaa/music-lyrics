My emotions 
Drift away 
I think about it 
But it's alright 
It's alright 
It's alright 
It's alright 
It's alright now 

My emotions 
Drift away 
I think about it 
Every single day 

Do I regret it 
Well I say 
That it's alright 
It's alright 
It's alright 
It's alright 
Out in space 

There's a feeling that runs through your viens 

One that has no time, no space 
Taking you high 
So that you can't deny it 
That's when you're in love 

Taking you high 
So that you can't deny it 
That's when youre in love 

Taking you high 
So that you can't deny it 
That's when you're in love 
That's when you're in love 

Taking you high 
So that you can't deny it 
That's when you're in love 

Taking you high 
So that you can't deny it 
That's when you're in love 

Taking you high 
So that you can't deny it 
That's when you're in love 

That's when you're in love
