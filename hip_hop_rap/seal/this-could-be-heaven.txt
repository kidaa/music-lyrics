We should be right here 
Get through all this fear 
One of these days 

Cause when it comes along 
We should be right here 
One of these days 

This could be heaven 

This could be heaven 

Livin' for the part 
Givin' from the heart 
Now and forever 

But if we let it wait too long 
What we have is gone 
Memory only 

This could be heaven 
Maybe we could start a life today 
This could be heaven 
Love instead of throwin' it all away 
This could be heaven 
You and me, we know we're our best friends 
This could be heaven 

Whoever thought we would get this far 
Tryin' for all these years 
The thought that we would fade away 
Was more than I could bear 
Oh, I would do anything if you would stay 
If you'd stay 

Say 

We should be right here 
Get through all this fear 
One of these days 

One of these days 

This could be heaven 
Turnin' it on for human kind 
With you by my side 
This could be heaven 

Sure we could decide to run away 
But we'd run away from all this here 
This could be heaven 

This could be heaven 

This could be heaven
