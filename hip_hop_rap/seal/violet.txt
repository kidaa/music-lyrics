Ooohh...I watch you comb your hair in different light. 
You change the chair and seem to think that's alright. 
I understand, 
You need a change. 
When you make that change, 
Don't look to see... 
I'm alright.

A violet unicorn to me that's alright 

I understand, 
You need a change 
The world will elevate you 
And when you make that change the world will elevate you... 

And if I told you then that I could cry, 
Would you take my tears and wash the sun rise? 
A man afraid... has no shame... 
So when you take those tears don't look to see I'm alright
