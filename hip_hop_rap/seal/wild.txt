With you on a clear day yeah
If tried I don't think I could end it better this way
All I have is a photograph
And if loneliness can hurt as much as being cold
Come over here woman and touch me you look so electric
'Cause all I ask is a second chance
Stroll on lady
Stroll on
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve and you take over
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve and you take over my pain
Oh love
You got a tear in your eye and a look to match it
Well maybe you think you just can't get me out of your hair
Don't try to resist it 'cause
We're getting stronger
The closer we become
You are the best thing in my life 
Stroll on lady
Stroll on
And take it to the edge
Ohh oooh ahhh ahhh oooh ahhh baby
Stroll on lady
Stroll on
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make the world resolve and you take over
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make the world resolve and you take over
Wild laces with diamonds in your hair
When you smile you make my world resolve and you take over for
How long
