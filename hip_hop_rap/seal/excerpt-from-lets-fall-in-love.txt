My emotions
Drift away
I think about it but it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright
It's alright now
My emotions
Drift away
I think about it every single day
Do I regret it
Well I'd say thats its alright it's alright it's alright
Out in space
There's a feeling that runs through your veins
One that has no time no space
Taking you high
So that you can't deny it
Thats when you're in love
Taking you high
So that you can't deny it
That's when youre in love
Taking you high
So that you can't deny it
That's when you're in love
That's when you're in love
Taking you high
So that you can't deny it
That's when you're in love
Taking you high
So that you can't deny it
That's when you're in love
Taking you high
So that you can't deny it
That's when you're in love
That's when you're in love
