Groove is quick but thickno trick words manifest
Lyrics I lick hype as hypeand SNAP made it hyper
Beat to the brain like abullet from a sniper
When the loser smooth likea cruiser
Beat the beat down I'm thebig bruiser
On to off to off onand on
This is the new-new breedof rap song
To the T.O.P tes the topI rock the spot hot
To be or not to be yes it'llbe MC Turbo B
yes to the groove yes it'sparty
Peace of mind
Time to unwind
Trip and dip slip the hipnow grip
To the Techno house of hip

'Cause this is the cult of SNAP

Hard to hold It's burningcold
We make the jam broke themold So it can't be sold
Took the vic stolen taken
Move to the groove dancefloorshakin'
Up and down you're spinningaround
You check the sound ,handsin the air
Party hard , hard not toparty moving close body to body
I for one the only son theonly child
Not mild but the kid iswild
Code name is Turbo B
Jam, jump, jump, jump, jump,and jam
The cult of SNAP
And SNAP is in command
To the point correct andexact
This is the cult of SNAP
