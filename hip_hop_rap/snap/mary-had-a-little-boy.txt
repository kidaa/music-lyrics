Oh oh oh oh, Mary, Mary

Mary had a little boy but little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go

Mary, a girl at a party
Pretty face, fantasy body
On the strength girl was fine
Mission: make her mine
So I stepped to her shyly
Before I could speak she walked right by me
Frozen, lost my cool
Out of the groove, what's my next move
Should I chill, should I follow
Heart is pounding, I feel hollow
Paused, thought for a minute
If she was a pool I'd jump right in it
So in her path I did step
Nervous but I still had pep
It didn't matter where she went to
I would be there too

Mary had a little boy but little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go

Saw her at the mall
Stand tall, courage don't fall
To her smoothly I approached
Tried to speak and almost choked
Abnormal for the ruthless chiller
Normally I'm a ladies killer
Why were my nerves shaky
I knew she'd make me and not break me

Here she comes, should I talk to her now
Yes, it's now or never

Mary had a little boy but little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go
Mary had a little boy but little did she know oh
Mary, Mary
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go oh Mary, Mary

Oh oh-oh-oh ooh-oh, Mary
Oh oh-oh-oh ooh-oh, Mary

Hello Mary, how's your day
Hope it's going in the right way
How about dinner and some dancing
Later on some romancing
Music, we could talk
And express our inner thoughts
How about it, what do you think
Ended statement with a wink

Mary had a little boy but little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go
Mary had a little boy but little did she know
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go
Mary had a little boy but little did she know oh
Mary, Mary
That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go oh Mary, Mary

Oh oh-oh-oh ooh-oh
