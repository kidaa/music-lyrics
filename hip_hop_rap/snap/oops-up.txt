This is a song about thosebad days
Start up happy and end upsad days
Talking about that murphieslaw chill
If it can go wrong, yesit will
Went to the store to copsome groceries
Friday night and I had themunchies
Filled the cart till itcould not take it
One more bag of chips wouldbreak it
Went to the cheek out stoodin line
Behind me a girl who wasjust too fine
Got in the ear while theyrang the total
Reached for my wallet uhoh a bolo
Not my day I felt like adummy
Went to the store and forgotthe money

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is herreputation
In school then she is graduation
Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she isnot about teasing
Left on the light so I couldsee reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteedsatisfaction
She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinesemath
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain myprotection
Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes itbroke

Oops up in side your head,say oops up
