I don't wanna move when I'm in your hands
There's nothing I can do or say
Put everything on hold, cancelled all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away, hey

She may be bad but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants

She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble, I know it

I never know what's running trough her mind
No tellin' what she's gonna do
Her every move is like a dancer sign
Darlin' me to come on through, hey

She may be bad but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants

She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble, I know it

She's trouble
She knows what I like
I got a feeling I'm fallin'
You're in trouble
Trouble, there's no hope in sight
I'm in way overmy head

She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble, I know it

I know it
