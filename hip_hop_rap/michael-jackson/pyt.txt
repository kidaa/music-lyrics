Where did you come from lady
and ooh won't you take me there
right away won't you baby
tenderoni you've got to be
spark my nature
sugar fly with me
don't you know
now is the perfect time
we can make it right
hit the city lights
then tonight ease the lovin pain
let me take you to the max
-Chorus-
I wanna love you  P.Y.T.
pretty young thing
you need some lovin T.L.C
and I'll take you there
I wanna love you  P.Y.T.
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' T.L.C.
Tender lovin' care
I'll take you there
-background group-
anywhere you wanna go
-2nd verse-
nothin can stop this burnin'
desire to be with you
gotta get to you baby
won't you come,it's emergency
cool my fire yearnin'
honey, come set me free

Don't you know now is the perfect time
we can dim the lights
just to make it right in the night
hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all I've got
-Chorus-
-breakdown-
Pretty young things

Michael I said na na na
PYT'sna na na
Michael I said na na na na
PYT's na na na na
-- 2 times --
Michael I wanna take you there
