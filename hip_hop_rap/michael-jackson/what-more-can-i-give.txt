Written and composed by Michael Jackson

Yeah, Yeah
How many people would have to die before we understand
How many children have to cry, before we do all we can?
If sending your love is all you can give
That we all live

How many times can we turn our heads
And pretend we cannot see
Healing the wounds of our broken earth
We are one global family
Just sending your preying
Is something you will feel
Helping one heal

Chorus:
What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?

Now let's rather lay down our fears
And reach out and make a pact
Show him the love that is in our hearts
Let us bring salvation back
Just sending your love
Has the power to heal
So let's all give

Chorus:
What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?

Chorus:
Say the words
I will lay me down for you
Call my name
I am your friend
Why do they keep teaching us
Such hate and cruelty
We should give over and over again
Over and Over again

Chorus 3

Don't do it
Don't drop the ball

What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
To love and to conceal you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?

What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
To love and to conceal you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?
