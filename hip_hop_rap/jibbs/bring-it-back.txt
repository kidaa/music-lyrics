You know them tags we popping 
Only the freshest I'm rocking 
I'm grabbing new fits 
It kind of hard to fall 
But it's so easy to ball 
When I be hitting the mall to grab a new chick 
Steady going telling bout the party I'm throwing 
Im already knowing that she feeling the way that im flowing 
Take the girl from her 
And I'm a bring her out the lew 
Letting her see the palm trees 
Showing her how Cali do 
from burning one to doing the bounce 
then we hitting the crunk 
As soon as we open them and any doors the party gone jump 
As soon as we turn up the music the speakers go bump 
and any body sitting down we gone tell 'em get up

So listen carefully while I put it in fast forward
