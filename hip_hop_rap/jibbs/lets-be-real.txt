[Chorus:]
Deep inside you know the truth 
He don't really love you 
Baby, you've gotta face the truth 
You know I'ma keep it real with you 
Let's be real 

[Verse 1:]
I was December in the Chi 
When I saw you walking by 
With the tears in your eyes 
And I walked up to your side 
So I asked you how you feel 
Girl is everything alright 
I want you to keep it real 
Girl you ain't got to lie 
See that dude is a mark 
A predator and a shark 
And I knew that from the start 
He wanted to break your heart 
You ain't got to think twice 
Cause I ain't that type of guy 
I'd rather see you happy 
I don't want to see you cry 
Let's be real, come on now 
Let's be real, he got no love 
Like I have for you, really feeling bad for you 
Out of all of this time he never had love I have for you 

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
He disrespect ya , he don't protect ya 
I know it hurts but you got to keep your head up 
He doesn't love ya, but I can treat you better 
That's why I think me and you should be together 
He doesn't need ya, bet I can please ya 
He doesn't trust ya, forever triny to treat ya 
He doesn't look at ya texture 
You should tell him that he really got you messed 
Tell him to beat it, me in your life you need it 

I'm willing to do whatever, you really can't beat it 
I'm your keeper, my words you need to keep it 
Fresher, I could be the reason why you breathing 

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
He disrespect ya , he don't protect ya 
When you in need he don't hurry to catch ya 
Hurt and neglect ya, certain to stress ya 
I ain't your daddy girl, you can do whatever 
Let's be forreal, come on now, Let's be forreal, you know what's 
Up Let's be real, come on now, let's be real, forever ma 

[Bridge:] It's best you let him go, or you will never know 
[2x:] What we could be, why can't you see 
I'm the one for you 

[Chorus out]
