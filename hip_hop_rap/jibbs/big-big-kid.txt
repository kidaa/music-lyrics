Yeah ok what's up y'all 
This is one of those dancing songs 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big 

flow so hot 
vvs diamonds in my big big watch 
you know I got it on lock 
keep a chick on my arm 
more than the watch 
she started looking at my finger 
maybe because of the rocks 
and now the g's on the block shock like the watch 
its like a car show when I open up my garage 
vipers, maserati, Lamborghini, drop tops 
cuty cuty hydraulics once we drop it like it's hot 
its all on tape matter fact you all are fake 
so that four arm will make your head alternate 
cause while you stabbing im jabbing 
you get to rapping and acting 
and try to make it a habit 
but tricks aint for silly rabbit 
flawless style will make you shake 
girls cry me a river like timberlake 
that's like music that's trapped in 
a stereo wrapped in 
a gift that you wrapped and so you aint hearing jack 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big 

pull up in a whip 
they want to see the T I P of my dip 
think I better get a grip 
my money like the Olympics 
I got to make a fist 
I never recall falling 
But I got to take a trip 
Im living on cribs 
while you dreaming in you crib 
so all you big babies can keep on your bibs 
staying on tour while my album getting shipped 
trying to get four picks 
plain bus car ships 
so give it break 
and still call Jibbs the great 
you need to chill with your grill 
saying jibs a fake 
cause while you be grilling your boy 
Jibbs be chilling 
Im trying to make me some millions 
Put chandeliers in the ceiling 
Doin it big 
Im trying to get more on my plate 
While you going half crazy 
I put half on a lake 
So sixteen's I spit 
For sixteen you get 
By sixteen im living 
Like sixteen was millions 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big 

doing big things 
rock big clothes 
with them big big chains 
and we fly big planes 
copter so fly so we flying through the rain 
young Jibbs switching lanes while you dudes being lame 
so who you know that is hot and could flow like this 
ride in the back of the range and rove like this 
stay iced out let it show like this 
I bet you aint got a chorus that'll go like this 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big 

We ride big big cars 
And big big rims 
And we rock big clothes 
With them big big timbs 
Got big cribs 
Cause we got big crib 
Im a real big kid 
cause we do it real big
