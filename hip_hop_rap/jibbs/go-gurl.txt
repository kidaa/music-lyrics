[Chorus:]
If the party start jumping 
And the beat start knocking 
Cuties on the dance floor 
Out there popping 
Go girl, go girl, go girl 
Go on get your money up 

[Verse 1:]
The way ya boy flip, makes you say the game over 
Sales ice cold, make music called cola 
And I ain't even did commercials for coke a cola 
Start biting on the shock, watch what tough sold her 
G, and they wonder why J.I. bragging 
I done spit so much fire they should call me dragon 
But not like sisqo 
Plus I got butter like crisqo 
So I copped the iced out crystal 
Man they say my mouth piece is lethal 
So if you want to battle then my words will eat you 
Just put your back out, should've knew I'll beast you 
And I am my own writer, I don't use dead people 

[Chorus:]
If the party start jumping 
And the beat start knocking 
Cuties on the dance floor 
Out there popping 
Go girl, go girl, go girl 
Go on get your money up 

[Verse 2:]
My flow's so contagious delivery so sick, 
You might get lnamonia just from hearing me spit 
So don't make threats talking what ya ain't did 
Cause all wolf tickets is doing is make ya lil' bitch 
I'm looking for a mill, so I couldn't be a cactus 
Cause being dropped ain't apart of my status, 
Living off what I might not be the baddest 
But I'd rather freeze ice then put it in my glasses 
They askin what, what type of cars getting driven 
Pull so many strings they think I play guitars for a living 
Metaphors is the bars I am fitting 

I ain't even in the sky, but ya boy meeting stars for a living 

[Bridge:]
If you wanna look fresh and you tryna go shopping 
If you ride by shorties start looking start stopping, 
Go girl, go girl, go girl 
Go on get your money up 

[Chorus:]
If the party start jumping 
And the beat start knocking 
Cuties on the dance floor 
Out there popping 
Go girl, go girl, go girl 
Go on get your money up
