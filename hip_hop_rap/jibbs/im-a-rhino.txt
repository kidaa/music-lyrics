Ah, my name is Jibbs but they call me mighty trump 
The kid down a house with an outerspace flow 
Stay waved up, poking madden with a flow 
Jag chillin in the back with girls holla at a chump 
Who you know gotta sea with a 3 in double beat 
I write my own stuff never will I need a ghost 
Spit so cold that you prolly need a coat 
And I keep bread til I bring about a house 
Clownin on stage but Jibbs is no hoe 
Lil' Lewis got 'em hangin from a rope 
All my diamonds real, no gold or glass coat 
If you all washed up, don't drop the soap 
Beastaz the music don't bang that low 
It bring ya feet where you can't feel yo toes 
And I'm the hottest - come on keep it on the low 
And they mad cuz I riot and I fly like a crow 

You a gold digging oh 
I aint messin wit oh 
Cuz I'm a Rhino hey 
I'm a rhino oh 
And I aint no 
You can go find yo and tryin those 
And sign no 
Go' on and throw the digits 
Or I aint messin with no 
Cuz I'm a rhino hey 
I'm a rhino 
And I aint no 
To go find no and tryin those 
And sign no oh 

Spit one's rhymes one to me is like fire 
That's because I gotta spread around like a high 
Jibbs and the whole lil lewis is a __
And we keep goin higher til we see ourselves fly 
Spit punch lines, we hit you in ya ear 
When I'm at a concert girls be drawin tears 
Move 'em in the dark no havin no fears 
Callin me a space ship the way I'm switchin gears 
If you a gold digger, I'm platinum plus 
Diamond out bizzle, don't let the platinum rust 
Boy perfect timing but I aint gon speak with glocks 
All up in your speakers, they call me speaker box 

You a gold digging oh 
I aint messin wit oh 
Cuz I'm a Rhino hey 
I'm a rhino oh 
And I aint no 
You can go find yo and tryin those 
And sign no 
Go' on and throw the digits 
Or I aint messin with no 
Cuz I'm a rhino hey 
I'm a rhino 
And I aint no 
To go find no and tryin those 
And sign no oh 

People when I see theyselves, that Jibbs is a beast 
One of me is like 5, so move more than 3 
Back for I gotta make my money increase 
And 5 is the reason why they lock my the key 
So if you aint throwin then you need to catch a chorus 
Keep switchin timbs, keep trees like a forest 
Deal with the rhymes like my sign is a Taurus 
And I'm all about mine, you can keep mindin yours 
Now speak for yourself, I'ma keep goin high 
I'm so above average I don't think you wanna try 
I'ma tell the truth that I don't have to lie 
And I'm beastin my peer I don't think you wanna try 
You can mess with Jibbs no man I think you wont know 
Cuz this rap thing yep I been doin long yep 
So you need to sit down with the thing 
Cuz I'ma just make your head spin
