Lil Wayne: Now load up pull back then aim
Bust and release 50 blame being hanged

My ree's strung up bo's fall half way
I jumping out of trees with a camoflouge AK

Send out no apologies but I got 50 niggas
Loyal to die for me
Look what da devil done to me
Running the beef punishing the streets
Na we each gotta knock of da leash
A bunch of empty shells
Walking no talking plot'n for power
Going riding in sour foe herion, rocks, powder
Tommorrow not promised
I got so much niggas behind us hungry paranas with intenions to be tymers
Fuck sitting around for the revolution to jump off
Look I'm bout my issues 50 shots gone set it off
 Chorus til end
