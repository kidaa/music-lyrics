[Lil' Wayne]
So you say you ready to hustle,
scuffle over a dollar, rumble over a bundle,
ready to bust over 2 dolars, ready to die for 5, 
ready to ride on 9, better be bout your change 
lettin hang at all times, ready to fight high,
duckin them blue eyes, ready to see ya moma cry 
every time you walk inside, ready to bring the funk, 
hide keys in the trunk, ready to live that life
one more night, knowin' you don't, ready to get ya pockets thick,
hustle hard sweat bricks, shoot you stick at a vick,
get her to buy a nick for 6, ready to serve Tammy,
50 dollars worth of wammy, ready to lose ya heart fall apart
from ya family, damn near gettin killed, a mil is only on ya mind,
ready to slang that iron, put in work over time, ready to get crossed,
put a hit out on a nigga boss, ready to shine and floss, 
is you bout that white sauce, 10 a keys the cost, bout to toss a nigga 3,
meet me at the dope spot 8 in the mornin next week,
now I was lookin for 30, you only had 26, I feel you tryin to play me,
Blow! get it how you live
Chorus
 Get how you live nigga, do you dig nigga?
 You ain't gone take my life, I'll split yo wig nigga.
 Get it how you live nigga, do you dig nigga?
 You ain't gone take my life, I'll split yo wig nigga.
[Turk]
Gotta watch yo back now, form all these licks that you did,

Get it how you live, how you live betta get it,

that monkey on ya back, yo mind you let em' take it, 
don't matter how much you try, nigga you can not shake it,
get how you live
Chorus
 Get it how you live nigga, do you dig nigga?
 You ain't gone take my life, how you fig nigga.
 Get it how you live nigga, do you dig nigga?
 You ain't gone take my life, I split yo wig nigga.

You ain't gone take my life, I'll split yo wig nigga.
[B.G.]
Nigga it's rough, comin' up, in the U.P.T., 
N.O.P.D investigatin' murders constantly,
you got coke don't let no one know where you lay yo head at, 
cuz they comin' to getcha',
and that's where you be dead at, 
gotta keep yo head up, make sure yo thing loaded up, 
keep yo game tight if you don't yo brains blowed up, 
if you hustle keep a pistol wit 17 on yo hip,
if a nigga run up on you trippin' let it rip, 
don't let a nigga get flip wit' ya, or close to ya,
cause he'll steal what you love most nigga
now take it how you wanna, bring it how you feel,
but that's how it is, ya gotta get how you live, 
and if you live the wrong, make yo cheese doin' wrong
then you might get shot up and bleed to death in yo home,
I'm kickin the real, and if you real, you could feel
that you could steal or get stole when you gettin' it how you live nigga.
 Chorus
Get it how you live nigga, do you dig nigga?
You ain't go take my life, how you fig nigga.
Get it how you live nigga, do you dig nigga?
You ain't gone take what's mine, I'll split you wig nigga
Get it how you live
