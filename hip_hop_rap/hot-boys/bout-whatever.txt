Young Turk:
Verse 1
Fatiuged up full of that dope ready for war
Me and Mark wit K's tearing yo station up
Baggin' that kill shooting at anythang that's chillin'
Wit a hundred rounds..so u know there's gonna be a killin'
Better stake yo-self in a place we can't see
Ramble at night in the evenin' we creep
Bout whateva nigga killin niggas like a season
Duct tape body snatchin niggas for any reasons
You best believe we'z real
We too hot and hard to kill
Now ? low as they could we get it how we live
Turn the ? spittin' stainin' witnesses and all
Ain't no escapin' choppers gone set it off
Lil' Wayne bout that funky shit
Leave nigga fire if out of line get rid of quick
The.....Magnolia is where I be
Where a soulja I leave a nigga stain
messin' fo weed

Verse 2
The young head busta
Eliminating niggas like nuttin'
Fifty shots I release hit yo block head bustin'
Turk and Wayne the youngest of the squad with the ride
Magnolia I represent til I die thats no lie
Infered beams chest head shots I'm givin'
Bullets flippin and still but nothing but gun smoke when u slippin'
And yo body hot like shit you drop nigga
Hit yo block in the jag wit the top dropped nigga
Soulja rags wit black bows I thugged out
Two times a hot boy wit' two slugs in my mouth
Before five we cocked back always ready for beef
Still got niggas on my side who gone ride wit me
I hope u bout what I'm bout cuz if not ya all in
I be in shitty colors A-K sex and ten
No heisitation in my blood line
Killin' niggas still no thang and I put it on yo mind
