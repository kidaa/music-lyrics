Verse 4: Juvenile
Now a nigga was makin cake rolls by the case loads
kept a chopper with a arm fold wherever I go
and I always had to hustle & I could go head
i was snatching by the truck loads all in your shit
my mommy used to tell me you gotta slow down
but I didn't wanna hear shit cause I was a clown
look I done showed you lil niggaz 
I done mold you lil niggaz 
you besta not play with me cause
look,i done told you lil niggaz
I ain't the one my nerves bad, I move quick
that was potna that you killed what's happening with you bitch
I hit em bam bam, two to the chest
bam bam two to the head
bam on through the neck
I looked up, now which one of you
bitches wanna be next, I picked the case
and then I broke through the Jects
Damn them bitches saw me i hope they don't talk
but if i think they gone talk beleive they ain't 
gonna walk, you see these golds, these diamonds,
all these houses, these jews, they got niggaz 
trying to jack and I'm acting a fucking fool

I know that a nigga wait'n trying to put it in my lap!
