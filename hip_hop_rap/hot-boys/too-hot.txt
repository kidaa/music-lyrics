B.G.
I took off, fuck the law
Lookin for B.G.
Sayin that I killed a nigga around the club last week
Get out the same ride in a big body
So I flip and scrip 9 minute EF three
Playin by different bitches cuz my face in the paper
Profile done although she couldnt describe me, I got the eraser
I don't discriminate I flip a bitch too
She got to be eleminated I kill a bitch too
She her hair fixed by my sister she lost  she gonna get her
To let me drop her off by this nigga
Off the river
She ridin with me thinkin that it's cool and shit
She dont think I know that she let her live loose and shit
I'm gonna pull over pull her out and pop some slugs in the bitch
And leave her pussy stinkin cuz I dont love a bitch
But I was smart comin up, never trust a bitch
And don't hesitate for a minute to chug the bitch
She was tryin to get me locked up
It was a must that the hoe get cocked up
Fuckin with me best believe that I'll do ya lots
Got ya sayin them Hot Boy niggas too too hot
Too too hot
Chorus:  Juvenile
What do ya call a nigga that be duckin the law  Hot Hot

What do ya call a nigga that don't give a fuck who you are Hot Hot
What do ya call a nigga that play it like its the ball Hot Hot

Juvenile
Lil one and gone
Lil one was stuck in this shit
Lil one say he gonna bust a nigga head if you fuck with his bitch
Lil one got the court hot
Lil one got the dough bar in front of your mama house up in your block
Lil one got the 44 cocked
Lil one ??? even no pops
So lil one dont give em no props
Lil one make em timber
Lil one got a bad temper
Lil one killed that boy in November
Lil one be hustlin
Lil one be thuggin
Lil one doesnt wanna come up from nothin
I know lil one aint gonna stop
I know lil one aint gonna let a nigga run him off the block
Lil one kind of remind me of me
Man lil one a G
Lil one runnin with the big boys
Lil one fuckin these hoes
Lil one got some of these old niggas rolled
Lil one makin his G's
Lil one runnin them Keys
Lil one four-hundred degrees
Lil one be shy
Lil one got twenty inches on his ride
Lil one got two calls for fives
Lil one don't give a fuck if he die or not
Lil one said to Jumball he gonna ride on his block
