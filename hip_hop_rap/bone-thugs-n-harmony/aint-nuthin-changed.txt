Chorus Krayzie
Aint nuthin changed, everyday
Aint nuthin changed....3x
Its an everyday thing when you hear tha bukk bang
Mo thuggstaz always claim
Stay thug up in this game
N remain tha same
So follow me now see now see
Up to tha double glock n
Hear pistols poppinpoppin

Everybody get, get down4x
Krayzie
I like ta puff up on my caine
Wittout tha grain

Ya'll gon' need all my change
Im pullin my people up outta tha bullshit
Thatz why we do this thuggsta music
You be pullin on tha dubie, dubie
B.o.n.e. So lovley
Gotta get, gotta get, get money
Mo money, thuggin
Foreva we keepin it real
Im ready ta show tha last nigga
How a mo thug hit tha shit
Than be rollin with tha murda, we golden
Rollin down with indo we go
Than get stopped, we all thugyeah
Ready to bust on in at night
Shoot em up, shoot em up
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Layzie
Im wonderin really how many more niggas'll be in a coffin
Before its my time, imma die right here
Take losses, not a dime
Everyday its tha same, n i gotta get mine for tha crime
My mental be blessin my pistol
My only utensil for cheddar
Its on tha level, war
Whateva my mind is my judge
Imma kiss or my pleasure with ya
Like kid come parlay with lay
All through my hood
Be back, everything gonna be all good
Niggas ridin real
Like i would
Goin against tha grind
Its all tha same, its all tha same
Smokin alotta weed 
No pain, no gain
You straight up hate, n thats a shame
How long we'll arrange
Bang, bang gotta get down for my thang
Aint nothin ta do ta get out of this game out of this game
You'll try, but you still will see
You could be
N roll tham greens of tha earth
Were religious baby
Baby tell me whut do you wanna do
Tell me whut you wanna do
You wanna ride n smoke with me
Or i can ride n smoke with you
Its all cool, its all cool, its all cool
