[Krayzie Bone]
You know I keep it true to my brain
Girl, I always stay one in me, I kept it real for 20 years, I aint changed
Be careful when you cruising in my lane
Watch me creep out through your rearview as I gas right past these lames
We did it how we did it cause we did it for the money
Living on, living this, you really, really love this
You want a thug nigga like me
Yeah, you know they all love niggas like me

[Layzie Bone]
She aint complaining mainly cause everything I do is entertaining

This aint your deal, this still the thugs shit but this for them playas
This for the ones thats putting the smoke up in the air
Everything 100 baby, this is St. Clair 

She want that thuggish ruggish choked up in function
Ticket for the love or the money

[Bizzy Bone]
She with the thuggish ruggish, wanna see me in public
She see I lost weight, now she wanna see the stomach
Your boo-boo still love it, women are here fucking
Lets make it, get it, fore we dove into the sea, touching
I come from broke nothing, I keep the ghetto with me
Because the ghettos in me, trill niggas still thuggin
She in the tell, in my cell, in the scale, in pale, ill, coached to the cell

[Flesh-N-Bone]
We got your lady stuck on a thug, say she want that love from me
Busters dont know what to do with it, come let her have some
I tell her shut up and the soon I take this game
Then rub her down, head to toe, and whip her up with that thing
I wont make a dime for the mind, sure thing its borderline in crime 
But Im doing fine and thats why Im the Dolla Sign 
I do it, do it two times, and Tesha scratch me now she hittin licks, calling me papi

She want that thuggish ruggish choked up in function
Ticket for the love or the money

Girl, everything 100

Everything 100, everything 100, everything 100

[Wish Bone]
Call nice for a while, we on a highway
She got her head in my lap, we riding dirty
Thuggers ruggers, swish of the month, see me shine
Notorious thugs for the love of money
I can teach the world to be a thug like me
If I could teach the world to be a thug like me

She want that thuggish ruggish choked up in function
Ticket for the love or the money 
I give her that thug love for doing my stuff
Girl, everything 100
Ima keep it 100
Everything 100, everything 100, everything 100
