The worlds enemy

The word says
Don't be surprised my brothers if the world hates you
because we have not received the spirit of the world
but the spirit who is from god
anyone who loves the world
the love of the father is not in him
the world and its desires shall pass away
but the man who does the will of god lives forever eternal
because you are not of the world and therefore the world hates you
and if the world hates you know that it hated me first
we are the worlds
enemy
