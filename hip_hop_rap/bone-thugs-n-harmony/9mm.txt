[Krayzie]
Nigga get ready for the big payback
Been thuggin and keepin the gulley since way back
Lot a niggas been talkin
they runnin they mouths barkin
Runnin around false
they claimin they want a weapon to rob us
My record is flawless
my method is lawless
i'm an automatic weapon nigga you just a target
The number one artist from the land of the heartless
fittin to get cha, hit cha nigga they couldn't call it
One nigga left and they talkin about we ain't happenin
so we had to give that up and make em recognize platinum
Look at everybody rappin just like i'm rappin
niggas got to admit it the Bone Thugs is the masta
THEY DIE, And there's NO COMPETITION, NO COMPETITION!!!!
Tear the roof off the mothafucka
I put a boot off in a mothafuckas ass
Still down to blast or clash with anyone of you niggas
who start we ain't trippin off of none of you niggas wooo
Leathface the boy is back, with a little bit of action bring it
rap it sing it
Bust it whateva dog
whateva ya'll want to do i'm with it wicked wicked

[Chorus]
Go loco with the heata nine milimeter
nine milimeter milimeter milimeter pop pop
Go loco with the heata nine milimeter
nine milimeter milimeter milimeter pop pop
Go loco with the heata nine milimeter
nine milimeter milimeter milimeter pop pop
Go loco with the heata nine milimeter
nine milimeter milimeter milimeter pop pop

[Wish]
I done had a mil took a mil blew a mil still in the streets that's how i live I live
I t don't mean a damn thing
still got a little change believe me
comin in
Shit i pass a nigga seen a lot of niggas point him point him out thats him here
It about to be E with a big cast eat him up
Send him on his way
kick him in his ass have a nice day
Went the wrong way
got a lot to say
It can get so murderous murderous
touchin us never that Bone Thug still the crack
Crack and I can't lay back
on the comeback
Spit on these niggas, spit on these niggas
run up any you niggas, any you niggas won' be no recognizin niggas
Just one warning impatient one time only ok
don't repeat myself bad for my health don't want to do that rather spray
Catch me on the wrong day, catch me on the wrong day
better stay out my way better stay out my face
That's the last thing you wanna do Thugs true
see the blues i shoot at you now you ??

[Chorus]
Go loco with the heata nine milimeter
nine milimeter milimeter milimeter pop pop
Go loco with the heata nine milimeter

Go loco with the heata nine milimeter

Go loco with the heata nine milimeter

[Layzie]
Ya'll know how i feel about fake niggas bitch niggas snitch niggas ain't no love for them
put a nigga in his place moma crying at the wake that's right
that's what a nigga does for them
I play above the rim I play above the rim
with no lames in my circle cause i love to win
With the real ass niggas with the thug in them
And if you talk too much i put a slug in them
Oh no don't play with em
Lay gon get em If Wish don't get em then Kray gon get em
Straight up we spit em
with a nine on my side and i slide to the rhythm
Let me slow it down in case you didn't catch my drift
lift a nigga up out his shoes trigga finga not hesitant fuck it
Let me speed it up hit em like the ammunition comin from my heata
ya'll niggas can't see these thugs 17 shots from the nine millimeter
On the creep with the nightvision infared beams pointed at your dome,
can't wait to see a niggas response
when i rip that vest with the teflon teflon
