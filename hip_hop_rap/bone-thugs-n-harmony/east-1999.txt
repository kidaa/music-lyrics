Little nigga on da grind
Gotta get mine doing my crime,

Steady stackin' my ends
Puttin' my serve down on the Claire 9-9,
Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift wid real

Krayzie Bone, stack right check much love
Kept ah nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang when you let ya nuts hang,
Gotta make ya grandas each daily man
Them Cleveland hustlaz neva no bustaz thug to the heart
We niggas from the land fool, and the old school,
Just serve out ya sentence and be cool
Fuckin' wid Trues rest in peace
My little nigga Ripster stress that Bone luv
Smokin' on bud, cause ah nigga Mo Thug
Callin' up my niggas when it's time to nut up
In the 9-9 niggas gon' drop to the number 1 wid ya gun so run run
Cleveland is the city where ah nigga come from
Slangin' them dum dum dum dums

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]

Niggas it's going down, up in the C-Town
Get 'em up wid the thug and the nigga wid the bud, got the fifth rose,
For the niggas that close hit 'em up wid the forty reasons
Nigga roll up the buddah,
Smoke it all up nigga don't stiff on the reefer
Mo runnin' up outta the club wid this
Plus I got hydro and this shit is creeper creeper
Strip as you hear the double glock glock
Widda me rocks cocked sweatin' me bad,
Coppers betta drop when the gunshots pop glock top
Hit the body and the bullshit stop
Wheneva them troublin' us,
Where the po-po niggas roll solo split up and swerve
Krayzie take caution,
Take out my llelo and tossed it
Send 'em in the road to the curb
Running, ducking, jumping,
Up in the land my niggas is craaazy,
Me slangin' wid nuff 'n me bang on the block
And nigga this daaaily,
Who the nigga wid the 12-guage Pump
Mr.Sawed-Off Leatherface so you betta pray
Eternally thugsta,
East nine-teen nine-ty nine

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]

Gotta give peace to the SCTs
And the one big thug on the glock,
Pump blast fa the cash
Then I mashin wid gas gotta dash away from the cops
Not lettin' no pause
Steadily flippin' up rows
Rippin' up flesh wid six dogs
That's that thugsta yes I pump slugs
And I be dripping 'em off in thugstas
Fuck them po-po, all ah dem bodies we burn, burn
And I guess that hood'll neva learn
Got it dipped both in hoes and sherm
When I'm on ah mission for my set-ty
Pick up my niggas be peelin' out wid me
Roll up me window me wind blow fuck up my indo
I'm an enemy, even up the barrels of me 12-guage
I empty, me scan-dalous niggas are pon de loose
But it's no fuckin' wid the family
Now feel it nigga understand me
Much love much bud for them St.Claire thugs
East nineteen ninety nine is where ya find me
Slangin' them mutha-fuckin' drugs.

[Verse 4: Flesh N Bone]

Dun dun leavin' the niggas to cock it pop widda me gun
They know that me noddin' they head off
And I gots to have me fun
Leaving 'em hung, breakin' fakin'
You studio gangsta bitch trick

And I split in the midst of the darkness,
Consider me heartless, oh yes Flesh be runnin' a hoe check
Betta check ya Rolex,

Ta them S-C-Ts from C-L-E the scandalous niggas that dwell

Leavin' ah trail ah the boody victims
The fifth dog maulin' and maulin' neva them catch me slippin'

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]

Wanna run red rum try to run and get away
But it's just to laaaate,
Watch out buckshots when I come buck buck
Betta guard that fuckin' face
Dumpin' them slugs on you fools
Rollin' wid me Trues, drinkin' brews,
Don't start no shit we come equipped
So niggas stay cool, one eighty seven,

Put slugs all up in that chest dunn,
To hell is where you be dwellin'
Popping ah clip in them bodies me dumpin'
Watchin' you fall to the pave
Wid me nine milli pumpin'
Puttin' dem bodies all off in dem graves
