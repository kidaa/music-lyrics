Reppin shit for bone thugs, nigga don't test mine to the redline
but like my Bone Thug niggas they ball show me the light, the light
Caught in the line of fire boy if you want to
and a nigga gon be on your ass like skunk's funk pew

[Lazie Bone]
Everywhere I look,
everywhere I turn,
niggas talkin bout death.
Like a nigga can't dream of nuthin else,
but a lil bit of wealth.
Tryin to help they self,
and I really can't blame you,
cause I do the same too.
Man do what you gotta do.
But what Imma do is keep protectin my cheddar fool.
Aint none of yall niggas do it betta, oooh.
And Im ahead of you and yall hate it,
only the real thugs keepin it raw.
Grippin that heat tight,
livin that street life.
Nigga Imma let it fool round and get war.
Niggas is plottin that 2-11,
thats why I got heat for armageddon.
Picture Lay on his knees and I'm beggin,
nigga betta shoot me and send me to heaven.
Fuck all the drama, Imma just blast,
hollow point tips off in that ass.
Tha slicka the nigga
thats pullin the trigga
is the nigga thats standin up last.
Countin this cash,
still doin this mash.
Blowin much weed
as we watch you bleed.
nigga got killed fo the love of the cheese.
Now you cant do shit cause your 6 feet deep.
Fuckin with Lay
is a game you shouldnt play,
even myself I could die today.
I could lie, but hey it aint worth it,
shit, aint none of us here to stay.
Imma hold my ground,
and Imma lace my boots.
So when its time to shoot, then thats it.
Screamin out Mo Thug in this bitch,
and Bone Thug in this bitch

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone 2x]
We can hit 'em in a minute, then be finished with 'em
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sick-o flow

Little Bizzy the Kid
They better know what it is
And get a hold of your kids
You better put in your bid
You better put in your dibs
And never look into the criminal biz
You gotta be in it to win it
Sinnin' is treacherous and dangerous
But it ain't with the program
And slow jam feelin' that shit
Feelin' that shit
Wheelin' that wheel
Feelin' that shit
Come in another respective
Recollective were the past we missed it
My family, I'm left out on my damn knee
But I've got God
Tell 'em better get up
'Fore they come and try to get 'em gotta pay them
When I'm on them on a mission better listen
Passed away, and that's the way we play
Nigga go, go grab your fo'-fo'
Better go get 'em
Criminal did 'em
One big fam, bam my man
You know that you got to feel 'em

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone 2x]
We can hit 'em in a minute, then be finished with 'em
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sick-o flow

Dun dun leavin' the niggas to cock it pop widda me gun
They know that me noddin' they head off
And I gots to have me fun
Leaving 'em hung, breakin' fakin'

Ta them S-C-Ts from C-L-E the scandalous niggas that dwell

The fifth dog maulin' and maulin' neva them catch me slippin'
