[Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony]
Bone xalot
Wasteland soldier, These are the days of our lives

I be struggling & hustling & thugging it forever
Come & look deeply in my eyes [x3]
I be struggling & hustling & thugging it forever & ever

Bone xalot
we gotta prepare [x3] for eternal warfare
[repeat 3]

Only time will tell who dies, these are the days of our lives
Come look deeply in my eyes, these are the days of our lives
See the murder mortalise, see the murder mo, these are the days of our lives
These are the days of our lives, these are the days of our lives

[CHORUS: 2x]
Now come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugz
We more than thugz, more than thugz, more than thugz
With just a little twist of harmony we smokin' lethal warriors
We warriors, We warriors, we warriors

[Layzie Bone]
Eternally thugz here i come telling them soldier stories
Been daily collecting my lessons, without any questions
Without any questions, stressing no restin, we journey this blessin'
Shift in the game rearrange ya thangs
cause once the world was bringin' me down
Mesmerized controlled by the other side, but the devil was in my town
looking for me

[Wish Bone]
But he won't find me in time, fucking with Bone and he liking these rhymes
We rhyme better believe it all the time, nigga we live
We straight up soldiers, Betta nigga done told ya, told ya
We raw before we go broke, nigga we robbin you all, all of you all, all you

[Krayzie Bone]
Yo my dawgs if you call or you fall
You depend on that nigga wherever then I will be there, lean on me
But let us get rid of the enemies be staying a while, while
But if you think you can hang, hang, hang

[Chorus x2]

[Layzie Bone]
Finally in the studio, you all know we roll hydro everytime we rhyme
I'm high, look at me deeply in my eyes, I rise to the top of my game
No way that I had to run, no way that I had to turn
Sherm, but a lot of these niggas won't learn
But the money I earn won't burn So come again

[Wish Bone]
Betta watch that Mack 10 nigga this one's for me and my friends
We steadily rollin', I told ya keep bringin' home platinum and gold ones
pap pap, put it all in the ground, yeah Bone, Yeah we used to get down
With the clack, back, put it on the ground, now get down

[Bizzy Bone]
Well it must be dawse, hydro, wanna roll my indo
Sittin all alone in ah my window, little Eazy bless his soul, It's so cold
Little Eazy got stress for the peeps, the streets
And none of these phonies hardly knew him
But still wanna pop the bitch locing bitch locing.

[Chorus x2]

[Bizzy Bone]
And it ain't no mystery the pistol'll be and i better put it under my seat
Betta read the scriptures sister, reach any or all of my readers
Said it ain't, it maybe double me up and get one foe my friends
Twenty, twen, twen, we biddin' on bud the bids at a fin
So who wanna bag? Who wanna bag?
You wanna bag? You wanna bag? You got a bag, sold!
So I'm sending my dawg to the liqour store for the blunts to roll
Only the Lord can tell who dies
So pick up the puzzle and pieces and put it together my love

[Krayzie Bone]
My lody Lord, maintain, it's hard cause I'm a soldier at war
Cause everbody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
But the evils ain't better than me, weed keeps me at ease
Take notes cause here it comes
The murder mo comin' to carry you, oh you oh
Wake up and they sittin and pulling their gauge out, Murder
And they put it up to your temple and we blow your brains out, Die

[Chorus x4]
