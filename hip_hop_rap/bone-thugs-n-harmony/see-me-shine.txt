[Krayzie Bone]
They don't wanna see me shine! Don't wanna see me shine! Don't wanna see me fly! Don't wanna see me ride! 

[Krayzie Bone]
Why they gotta hate? hate! Steady hatin' mine! mine! Smilin' in my face, face! fakin' on the side. They don't wanna see me shine. 
[Jay Rush:] 'Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna, they don't wanna see me shine!

[Layzie Bone]
As long as I'm alive, no hater gonna never stop my drive! I did it and make it multiply. Anything else is suicide. Enemy of the world ? that's I. Energy of an eagle. I see no evil and I hear no lie! Niggas don't wanna see me fly higher than a rocket ship. Life is not rocket science. Every day is documented. All of my time is occupied. I'm gonna grind & I'm gonna shine! Ballin' 'til the end of time. Hate on me and it's all fine! You just ain't no friend of mine.

[Flesh-n-Bone]
I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things. With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game! Imagine problems with crooked coppers. Why they wanna go there? Try to pop me, lock me, but couldn't knock me off my square. I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see Flesh stretched out without one thug, while I'm steady stressin' out But we doin' our own thing ? the wrong thing. You suckas fail everytime tryin' to stop my shine!

[Krayzie Bone]
Stay away, fade away, playa hater! Stay away, fade away, playa hater! I need you to? Stay away, fade away, playa hater! Stay away, fade away, playa hater! Twenty-four seven grindin'! Tryin' to get my shine on. That don't give 'em a reason to hate me, hate me, hate me! But I know my mind's strong. None of you suckas can break me! Ha! Nothin' can save ya now! They caught the Krayzie vapors! Stay away, fade away, playa hater! There's really no need to be crowdin' me, 'cause I can't deal with you haters surroundin' me, houndin' me! Tryin' to get my paper, hard to keep my faith up. It's time for me to raise up, and do this sucker shake up. True? T-H-U-G's and we come to kill you, kill you, kill you! I think they might be scared might be scared to let me shine 'cause I'm a righteous playa! I'm a righteous, righteous, righteous playa!

[Wish Bone]
See Me! Stack your paper, they hate my grind. Catch me! Push that's why I got my swagga down. Could never slip in the clip in. I know they want my life. Any weakness, not here, you know that Wish gonna ride! ride Hit the streets with that, better love! Watch out if you kiss and tell. You know not to show 'em love. It's just that they talk too much. You just never know who to trust. And just when you get enough, a target ? you will become. That's just the ??...

[Bizzy Bone]
It's the devil's perpetuation! Tryin' to make my innocence. It's my retaliation, I don't need no ignorance. I'm standing against this army with Bone Thugs-n-harmony, harmony. Danger is just a part of me, like it's stuck in my arteries. These poor playa-haters are the motivators. But I get my paper, paper. The same rappers that hated us bought the verses, so we can take from them. Critics ? we can't escape from them. Don't you drink too much Hennessey. Ain't no time for to be slippin', we the world's worst enemy!

[Jay Rush:] I just got to know! They don't wanna see me shine! They don't wanna see me shine!

[Krayzie Bone]
They don't wanna see me shine! They don't wanna see me shine!

[Jay Rush]
So many people said we wouldn't take it, so many people said we couldn't make it! So I made up my mind!
[Krayzie Bone:] So I made up in my mind I had to take it. So I made up my mind I can take it. So I made up my mind. I just gotta know, I just need to know. I just gotta know. I just gotta know. Why they wanna hate on me? Why they wanna steal my shine? Why they wanna hate on me? Why they wanna steal my shine? I just gotta know! I just gotta know! I just gotta know! I just gotta know! See me shine! See me shine! Oh see me shine! Oh see me shine! Yeah!

[Krayzie Bone]
They don't wanna see me shine! They don't wanna see me shine!
