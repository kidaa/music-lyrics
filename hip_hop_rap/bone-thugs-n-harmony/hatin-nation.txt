Nigga, there's far more pictures of the scriptures, missed 'em 'cause
they're despicable, but, bitch you're makin' millions off my physical
residual. Tradtional, but mystical, where were you at when pistols
blow? And what about welfare and health care? Well, I guess that
missed you, ho. And I guess you watch my brains tissues and if there be broke-asses
knowin' for the moment, noticed you 'fraid, 'cause yous are fools..fools.
