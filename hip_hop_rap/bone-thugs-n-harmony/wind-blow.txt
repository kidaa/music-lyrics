[Layzie Bone]
Bone Thugs n Harmony
A yo we ain't always been accepted like this till listen to the wind blow
A nigga got that Grammy
Open the door nigga,

Bone Thugs got a story thats similar to Mike Jones
You can ask my homies
Im member back in the days they didnt want me
Now I blew up they all on me
They smiles phony
It's hard to determine who really is rich or which of these niggas is fake
They tryna eat out of your plate
And you can't get a break
Now how much can you take
For heaven's sake
I can't wait they gone be
listening to the wind blow

[Krayzie Bone]
Sitting back blowing on indo
Waving with my middle finger hanging out the window lets roll
Get your motherfucking hand out my pocket
Now they wanna be with a nigga
Feel like we partners
Nigga we was looking for a deal and you dodged us
Never did call us
Where was your promise?
But now we riding by
listening to the wind blow

[Wish Bone]
Nigga to the real to the sets
When it comes to the streets
Living peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace won't let is go
Say we wouldnt make it
Now we some of the greatest
Bumping through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo

[Chorus x2]
You dont love me now
And youll never love me again
You can't you can't say it
You would never break the chain
Never break the chain

[Layzie Bone]
For true thugs from the double glock
A nigga ready to rumble
When trouble nocks
To one way tickets straight off the block
We gonna this pay
You all niggas just watch
All eyes on me
Like my name is Pac
Fucking hip hop clock
Gotta pass the glock
Taking drastic shots
Till these bastards stop
When the casket drop
I be mashing out
In brand new drop top flying nigga
listening to wind blow

[Krayzie Bone]
Killing them niggas with an automatic weapon
When they step up
they get hit up wit the AK-47
Anybody tryna git the motherfucking blessing
They better not mess with mine 'cause I'm telling
Any you niggas run up again
That it ain't no pretending go for sin you're gonna git in
Boy you better listen listen listen
listening to wind blow

[Wish Bone]
If you get a change of foot
Inch for inch
You better do it do it
Grab the game
Do it to it
Chase to chase
But still hood
Live it or love it
Dummies of  the rocks
Duck up out of my hood hood hood

[Chorus x2]

Murder mo murder them all [x4]

[Krayzie Bone]
? The wind blow
Never see me 'cause I get ghost
So a nigga never get close
I go fast or slow
No matter the tempo
Murder the instrumental
Murder the rhythm
I ride to the rhythm of murder
It's murder
This lyrical venom I serve a
Gone kill um at minimal murder
Nigga burn some some
Stick wit rans that's that cash
Nigga you better learn some some some
We got the hood hot lock
Even got the burbs bumping bumping
They probably tryna get in
Dont nobody  wanna be left in the wind

[Layzie Bone]
Uh-oh
Niggas thats not tryna listen to Bone
The early bird get the worm
Take the game by the throat and squeeze
Till the motherfucker broke believe
It's murder we wrote
It's dope that we serve on the curb to the booth
These niggas dont feel it 'cause we spit the truth
Ain't never no fake and they got me to prove
Haters just hate and we do what we do

Let um talk to you in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If was Bone hurting
If that was the case
Ill probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga just move and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga dont quit till I finish the race
Number one is the place

[Chorus x2]

[Krayzie Bone]
Now we riding by [x4]
