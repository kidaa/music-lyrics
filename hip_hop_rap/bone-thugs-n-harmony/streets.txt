[Verse One - Layzie Bone:]
Now I sound so raw, 'cause I'm down by law, tryna play me 'cause I'm rapping I will break your jaw, catch a
nigga in these streets make you take clothes off, leave you dead butt naked, man you're fucking with a
boss, cross pass with me, I'm in the hood all them watts in the Bronx where they cater all around
the devil block, trouble not, I'm ready for 'em, niggas they know I'm ready for them, I'm the hardest
I'm a deadly [?] so I'm heated heavy for it, why are you looking for me nigga with your looking ass, meet me at the
club all my niggas get to whipping ass, then a nigga sue me, sue me nigga posed to be thug, nigga
posed to be street, pull your skirt down nigga 'cause we're smellin' your pussy, the whole bottom line is
you can't fuck with me, Will.I.Am the ghetto! Will.I.Am the ghetto! streets!, 'cause I'm a thug by
nature, thug by nature, gotta keep thuggin', I'm thuggin', gotta keep thuggin', I'm thuggin'.

[Chorus - Will.I.Am:]
you're looking, for me, I'll be, rollin',
you can find me in the streets, you, you can find me in the streets,
if you looking, for me, i'll be, rolling'!
you can find me in the streets, you, you can find me in the streets.

[Verse Two - The Game:]
It's the black rag assassin, forty for mag blast, and black ski mask throwing shots out a dodge
magnum, gangbang forever put the barrel on the head of the devil, with homicidal intentions I reign
terror, on any cliq or squad you niggas bitch you fraud, I'm a ticking time bomb let it finish the
job, lyrical damage on one, two punch, crush you amateurs, box and watch me execute like
cockins?, my flow piping hot scorching, proceed with caution murder any MC, your soul is lost, when
I'm riding with them bone thugs, black glocks and chrome slugs, parked on the block with the nose
up, get ready for the face off, Nicholas Cage ain't got shit on a nigga with a fucking grenade, one
man army, only two things in the world can call me, west pussy and that bomb ass chronic, I never
back down, never back down, never back down, now let the bone thugs back.

[Chorus - Will.I.Am]

[Verse Three - Krazie Bone:]
Now we them niggas in them black dickies and steel toe boots, stomp on that nigga that got a
pistol but he still gonna shoot, 'cause he's a hoe, like half of' these niggas is rappin', I'm gonna let you
know, these niggas is actin' and puttin' on a fancy show, we done checked these niggas, met these
niggas man I don't respect these niggas, I'm a real motherfucking T-H-U-G, original hate to be a
critic, but your shit I ain't feeling, no, your niggas is elementary, I got history, lyrically you can't
see me, physically I'll bring your misery, seriously, you niggas ain't been hearing me, but listen
to these other niggas hits, you hear my twist they blew my shit, but it's all good, 'cause we keep it
all hood, and when we see niggas get rolled dog like a hog should, just lemme put the mother
fuckin' money on the wood, bitch niggas would be gone if they could, but I'm gonna shut 'em down, I'm gonna
shut 'em down, I'm gonna shut 'em down, bone niggas known not to fuck around!

[Chorus - Will.I.Am]

[Verse Four - Wish Bone:]
I got my hand on my balls, gripping in the raws, hood star, shit could be my boulevard, you know
I'm in the streets, I ain't hard to reach, on some cool shit and some beef shit nigga I'm in the
streets, this ain't my only occupation hittin' avenues, chasing paper always, and I know how to get
it, and pissy hallways, in the raw way, you can get it how you live, nigga step the wrong way, I
let it bang b-bang bang, I'm the street for real, and I love it but you know how the game play got
me ready to kill, somebody, but it's all good, with these shows at my streets nigga all good, gotta
be stacking my paper like that's all I know, these niggas is playing, I gotta get it like lock and
load, winter through summer, summer back through to winter, we hustling dawg, hustling, hustling,
hustling, give it all you got, give it all you got, hustling, niggas is talking bout weed now watch
your mouth!

[Chorus - Will.I.Am]
