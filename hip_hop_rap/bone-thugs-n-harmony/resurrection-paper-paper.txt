Morning, my baby's bangin', beefin' with me, squashed it, ordained it, better yet sustained itflurry. Hide in the fury, cause the ways of abroad could mean you die out of the highlight in a hurry. Burned me. Baby tied down with childhood scars, crack-head cars. Niggas, I don't know that. Who died in the war Now here we are. Steady, we roll out over you. When it's over, it's over for the soldiers who with me 'til they hear me. Come a little bit closer, stand right near me. Here we are, ain't no stops, uh uh, uh uh. Can I get drunk off in the bar without some haters sayin',  quot;Who do you think you are quot; When I'm sober, soldiers went into Heaven.

Nigga bad to the bone when I sure don't clique with hoes with no bustas, haters, or hoes--when they poppin' up at my door, I get excited. All uptight and violent, bitches was not invited.

Money ain't a thang

Layzie
Time after time everywhere I look, everywhere I turn, niggas talkin' bout death. Like a nigga can't dream of nothin' else, but a little bit of wealth, tryin' to help theyself. But I really can't blame you cause I do the same too. Man, you do what you gotta do. But what I'ma do is keep protectin' my cheddar, fool, ain't none of ya'll niggas doin' it better. Ooh and I'm ahead of you and y'all hate it. Only the real thugs keepin' it raw. Grippin' that heat tight, drivin' that street light. Nigga, I'ma let off a round and get war. Niggas is plottin' that 2-11, that's why I got heat for Armageddon. Picture Lay on his knees and I'm beggin', nigga better shoot me and send me to Heaven. Fuck all the drama, I'ma just blast hollow point tips off in that ass. The slicker the nigga that's pullin' the trigger is the nigga that's standin' up last. Countin' his cash, still doin' his math. Blowin' much weed as he watch you bleed. Nigga got killed for the love of the cheese, now you can't do shit 'cause you six-feet deep. Fuckin' with Lay is the game that you shouldn't play. Even myself, I could die today. I could lie, but hey, it ain't worth it. Shit, ain't none of us here to stay. I'ma hold my ground and I'ma lace my boots, so when it's time to shoot, then that's it. Screamin' out Mo Thug in this bitch! and  quot;Bone Thug in this bitch! quot; Nigga!
Wish [Bizzy]
It's all about money, yeah, and I'ma get me some. Can't be fuckin' with niggas that ain't got none. Cause lately y'all been actin' funny, I guess you smell some money. Get out my pockets, better count your shit. It's still St. Clair wig-split. Four other niggas that I run with, you don't want to fuck with. Fool we gettin' dollars [dollars and dollars but] and dollars , but still [still we gotta gets more] we gotta gets more. Remember back in the day when we was fucked up, but not anymore. [Unh-uh, no no!] And ain't a damn thing come easya lot of plannin', bus rides, and Eazy. [Eazy] For cheese, hey believe me, believe me, [believe me] and it ain't gonna stop 'til end of my time with my Bone Thug love, I'ma always get mine and I mean that. Can I have that paper, paper, money, money, money, money
