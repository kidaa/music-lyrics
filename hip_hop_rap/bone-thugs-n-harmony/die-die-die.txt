[Krayzie Bone]
I pop pop droppin' them niggas with the glock gun  
Nigga, you best start run, duckin' the shotgun 
leavin' 'em up off my block stunned  
One eighty seven lesson and we done told ya  
you fuckin' with Bone  you better believe we livin' like soldiers  
We lovin' that thugsta shit so nigga just throw your pumps in the air   
Then you pump pump put one in a coppa like ya just don't care  
You don't wanna fuck with you don't wanna buck with a realer nigga  
Better check my manuscript 
drugdealer, killa, cabbage peeler 
Thug with Lil' Ripsta number one with the gun come come get some  
Senseless killa Fifth Dog and posse run get gone
Fuck with the Bone four niggas strong leave 'em alone til' it be on  
Krayzie put on one in your dome 
and nigga be thinkin' I'm wrong so go on 
Cause nigga the sawed-off ain't full of shit  
Me lovin' to smoke tweed and me weed man  
They givin' me what me need man when I light my blunt 
fold the niggas up in me hood so when we smoke smoke smoke 
get paid good so we gonna blaze good  
So come to The Land where all the thugs be real  
Them St. Claire niggas they ain't no joke 
so catch a slug or chill nigga

[Chorus]

[Cop]
Lie down with your hands behind your back
[Gun being cocked]
[Bizzy Bone]
Naw bitch you lie your funky ass on the ground..now
[News Reporter]
This seemingly routine investigation 
had become a horrible nightmare..

[Bizzy]
Running with gats and bats 
so nigga don't test rest or you get a peeled cap  
pap pap that pump better check that gun 
for a nigga done get that skull cracked  
Lil' Rip done rolled up 
the bigger the nigga the quicker get showed up  
Let's swerve to the birds set up a hold up 
so many bodies me blowed up  
Nuts bucks and guts nigga mistakin' them balls for dogs  
All niggas'll get mauled no thing to pick up a pump 
and people know ya and never hold ya especially when them rolls up  
Bet I bringin' in them guns run a thug get low down  
You don't wanna get nutted cause' nigga you gonna get bloody 
once you see the braids and skully 
Cuttin' that throat when I'm rippin' up somethin' lovely  
What is it in ya? deep in the dead when we get fried  
POD when I comes to ride
Creep but you sleep and then fall in the night 
once inside forgettin' about remorse your curse will ride  
cry now when you're ready to lie down  
when I'm weak in a mental state 
Somebody gonna die now

meanwhile swerve to the burbs

[Witness 1]
Man he just all of a sudden just jumped out of a window  
I didn't know what was goin' on I'm just walkin' by  
Just got a bottle of wine..  
I was just walkin' by 
and all I seen was him jump when that lady yelled  
And that was it.  I don't know? 
[Witness 2]
Well I saw his wife begging him 
and she said "don't jump" and he did
[Reporter 2]
Did you know the guy?
[Witness 3]
He sure had a problem 
That's all I could tell ya
[Witness 4]
All I seen was them put the lady in a police car 
and take her  I guess it was his wife
