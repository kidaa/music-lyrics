
Let's Do It Again 
Let's Do It Again 

[Chorus:] 
Sweet Breeze In The Summer Time 
Were Makin Everything Alright 
Always Keep Ya Hypnotized 
We Keep Ya Feelin Oh So High 

...like Its 1999 
All Over Again With All Of My Hustlas, Soldiers By My Side 
Been A Long, Long Ride, Im Still Amazed How The Time Fly By 
A Lot Of My Niggas Didn't Make It To See This 
But Im Not Gonna Cry 
We Slammin Doors On The Caddy Coupe 
After Bar Groupin 
When Them Niggas Was Out There Shootin 
Drinkin 40s On The Roof 
Went From Zeros To Six Figures 
To Seven Figures And Better 
Niggas Determined To Get On The Level 
Down For Whatever, Chasin That Chedda 
Ride Anywhere Neccesary, The Celebration Is Neccesary 
It's A Hard Load To Carry 
But That There Was Temporary 
I Let It Relax Sometime 
Just Chill Out With My Money 
Then When Layzie Bone Is At It Again, Another Summer 
Lets Have A Ball Nigga And Keep This One Blazin 

[Chorus x2] 

Hey They Thought It Was Over 
The Bone Thugs N Harmony Was Finished 
But They, They Must Of Forgot, They Forgot How Much I Rapper Like I 
Sat Back Recline, And Trained My Mastermind 
Came Up With A Faster Rhyme 
In Time This Dogg Has Got U Hypnotized 
So I Gotta Ask Them How In The Hell We Gon Fall Off 
When We Got Half Of This Industry Swangin From My Balls 
Me And Dawgs 
Untouchable Niggas, Could Never See Us, Never Be Us 
Wont Even Get Close Enough To Try To Defeat Us 
Niggas That Have They Come Learn With The Milla-Meta, Meta 
Loudest Niggas You Ever Gonna See Ah 
Talk And Get Served And You'll That We Be It, Runnin The Game 
Still Doin Our Everyday Thangs, Bang 
So I Really Hope U Got You Game Up 
Cause We Comin Hard So Don't Get Envolved 
If Ya'll Aint Ready To Bring Ya Gangsta 

[Chorus x2] 

You Feelin We Slippin Huh 
You Think That We Missin The 1st Of The Month 
10 Years We Done Been Here 
We Spending Them Thangs And Bringin Them Guns Yup
We Better Get It, We Don't Have That Ammunition 
But I Bet We Takin It There 
Got Us A Mac If U Wanna Ride I Aint Braggin But I Keeps It Real 
You Know Them Thug Niggas Is Gonna Bring Something 
That Everybody Gonna Feel 
You Ridin And Rollin And Smokin And Bumpin 
Yeah That's How I Live 
And I Been Here So I Live Here 
Wont Put Me Out My Crib 
My Address Is The Game And My Second It Is The Hood 
We Comin Back Like Cool Water And Soda 
A Couple Of Shakes And We Hittin The Hood With That Heart 
Do It Again We Gotta[?] 
Part Of The Thugsta Law Back To Nothing 
Nothing Bumpin Goin To Jump 
I Did It Then And That Is Where Im From 
And I Can Do It Again And Again And Again And Again... 

[Chorus x2]
