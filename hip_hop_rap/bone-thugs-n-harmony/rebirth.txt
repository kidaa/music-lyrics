[Chorus - Thin-C & Krayzie Bone:]
Everybody wanna sound like, sound like, sound like Bone, Bone, Bone! Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone, Bone, Bone! As we continue to pick up the pieces, they follow us Kings til the sundown. Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or lay down. [X2]

[Layzie Bone:]
Hold down! Welcome to the showdown! showdown! I think its 'bout time little Layzie let 'em know now. Take it to the streets and let the pump, pump go Pow! Take my style, let me show you how I go wild. Now you playin' with a fully-grown man, with a fully-blown plan, with a fully-loaded clip. Ima go up in your shit. I don't play with little kids, I spank that ass, boy you know who we is! Bone, Bone, Bone! My homies the greatest! I roll with the best, see? Who in the fuck wanna test these niggas from the S-C-T, C-L-E? We got heat! Y'all know what happened to the thief when the king catch him stealin, got his hands in the cookie jar. Off with his hand! Fuck it, off with his head! Make him stand front and center, let me see what the rookie got? Bet a nigga ain't got nothin', they bluffin'! Tryin to come up on somethin', bubblin'! Ima say this really, really, really loud! Y'all wanna rumble, Ill bust them, rush them! Trust him, never! On a whole 'nother level. If God The Creator, then yall niggas devils. The fight won't end 'til the war get settled. And Bone gonna win cause them Bone niggas' rebels. Playa!... Yeah! Nigga!

[Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone:]
They dont wanna see me shine! Everybody wanna sound like Bone though come back in the Bone zone! But you just beginnin with the daddy you dont know. They call me The Granddad  Granddaddy of the Bone flow! Well little lazy rappers, obviously we never figured this would be the lick and wed be next to shine. And we got everybody screamin and singin but these out-of-shape suckas need exercise! So I'ma get up in their mental. I'ma work 'em out over the instrumental! Give 'em a criminal rhythm, the lyrical nympho! Wanna see the wicked? Better know what youre in for! First, the fan side could be forgiven  you didnt know! Second time, I got up in 'em like "here we go!" No matter what, they sayin' we still the most realest that ever did it, feel me flow! And everybody want a little bit against a little Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh! A little taste so they can test and make em see how we the best and Ill be realer than the rest dont flex cause the pump gonna get em. I'm like a bullet to the chest, suffer a cardiac arrest thats so hard and I can still get their heart and leave 'em dead and give em all they can get! Send them suckas to the lyric cemetery, or the rap hospital. Never no competition!

[Chorus]

[Flesh-n-Bone:]
Come on, now let me take you back to The Land, you know where the heart of it all. In 1993, when we was up out the scene. The fellas with hell of a harmony with the flow hooked up with Eazy-E and shook up the industry and y'all just in time to get another phase. This certainly is somethin that you wouldnt wanna miss! The drama when it hit the fan, we got 'em trippin' off the gift, and split a wig up with a pretty sick twist. The Ruger like a surgeon and its on, exactly what I cut you with is sharper than a scalpel. Actually, it's too many Bone Thug clones and they all malpractice, arrested, and send em to the gallows! My trues brought a style thats unfound and you can feel it naturally. But we aint no magicians. Really aint no thing to make a fraud disappear. Steady givin' what they love to hear, make 'em listen up close. Everybody know we got the dough. We choppin nothin but missiles, still the nigga who the greatest! Yall lost! Can't even afford the cost, this is authentic and nothin thats dealin with them world-wide bosses! We got the sauce, baby, we got the juice! We keep em in a frenzy fiendin for more! On the ThugLine with F.B.G., 7th Sign, and Mo Thug once again we about to blow! We about to blow! Set it off  explode! Set it off  explode!

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone:]
I'ma treat it like a race and I gotta win it! Ahead of you bums with the Bone flow. Thug invented. Haters wanna wonder why them thug niggas still gettin' in. Nothin' changed the game like we did so we here, still with it. Gotta tell the truth. We changed things. Bringin' somethin' new that's everlasting. I'ma keep it real. It's next to nothin'! Doin' the same thing 'cause less creating. Flow just borin', the spit just corny. What happened to old bitin' 'self? Writin' battles done face to face. I miss those days. These days, ghost writers, fake artists with nothin' to say. I'ma give it Wish due my street dues. Just stay cool. I know I got you when I need to pop you'll let loose. And you don't wanna see a thugsta hit with a Grey Goose. Or we could buy the bar. Just stay cool and we good. Recognize we thug, could of been all hood. The flow's all love, thugs could of been all hood. Pick up on it, never fully get it - this Bone flow! Smilin', hatin' but you'll see me on the low! low In the game with the number one! Straight from the Cleveland slums. Straight off the block, never hustle to the floor though. Kickin' 'em down how them Bone Thugs came through. Yeah, yeah. We took it to another level level, level level, level level... Yeeaahh!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone:]
Down, down... As soon as I'm receivin' the call, now give me the ball, I run with the dogs, then keep the b'all. Now meet me at the mall, you can check on every shelf on the wall, they makin money off the Bone Thugs! Equipped with a saw, with a knife in my back. Everybody rappin fast, but the harmony ain't in it, and now that's too much to pass. Now that's too much to ask when you pick up a crash course style to change-up, come on! I swear! My trigger-finger's itchy, but my carpel tunnel was ? was written and rippin' problems like water flowin' in humbles. I'm workin with seven shovels, the grave-diggers and others! Nobody understand The Man. Clones - now shut-up! Im quicker than a boogey-wicked-monster, never just like the movie. We know when we pray to God. ? we get the hustle on in the Spring, Fall! In Summers and the Winter months, we gonna praise... Jesus! Don't even represent us, like we aint said nothin! Present the flow then grown know where we come from. Sun come shine in, Equinox rhymin, Layzie Layzie! perfect timin, grab my gun! gun, gun Much love to my nigga young Hova, Twista, Bun B, Pimp C, A.C. Killer! Get your money, get your paper. Elevate like my nigga DMX. Here's a prayer - God bless playa! 

[Chorus]
