[Layzie Bone]
Straight from the muthafuckin' land ah the heartless
Five true thugs from the double glock
Ready ta pop to the dome, eternally it's on

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]

Straight Mo Thug nigga return from the Claire
Test this hustla betta not dare
We talkin' about distributing llelo
Little Layzie beat it
Daily collectin' me bank roll
Rollin' wid Trues, nothing to lose
Never the less ain't about that talking
Screamin' out murda coming ta serve ya
Nigga we told ya Bone be stalking, we walking
Number one assassin
Pick up the pump and it causing the 12-guage eruption
Let loose wid ah buckshot blastin'
Bone up outta the cut and we buckin'
Eternally here to stay in the khaki suits and the high tec boots
Oops I'm comin' wid troops, fools
Be ready ta shoot collectin' my loot
Blazin' and burnin' my grain
This year the same I crept and I came
Niggas that fell off that thought they could hang
Givin' up slang tryna' fuck wid ah chain gang BANG!
Str8 land ah the heartless
Where the thugs be thinkin' ah execution
Str8 prosecution little Lay go buck and start the fusion

Pullin' me body underground

You can run but won't escape the lie
So many tried but died

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]

Smoke bud all day and maintain

Four crazy niggas wid nuthin' to looooose.

Bodies gon' fall my Cleveland niggas what's up
Ya down for that thang gotta gang bang bang if you have to,
Beat ah nigga down in any town,
