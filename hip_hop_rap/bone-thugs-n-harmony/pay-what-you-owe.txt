[Verse 1 - Layzie Bone]
See, all I know was get out and get it
I stay on the grind all night til my feet go numb
Blowin mo weed than Cheech & Chong
Livin by the motto: To each his own
Got speed, its on
Flesh freed, he home
Then wed go wrong, it wasnt in the plan
Designed by the Man upstairs
This testimony and we say, We can, we can!
We can do it
Gotta put ya mind to it
Put ya feet in the dirt
Just push right through it
When shit get rough
You gotta stick to it
Play that Bone Thug music
Its that feel-good music
Chill or act a fool with it
Real thug niggas with real-life drama is just like watchin a movie
Soundtrack of my life
Right how they bounce back more than twice
Alright, I admit we done did some crazy shit
But I stop, repent
Kept God in my sights
Recognize it was a fight
Either youre wrong or youre right
Let the song be the light
Eternally them Bone Thug soldiers
Im Mighty Mo-Thuggin fo life!

[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]

[Verse 2 - Flesh-N-Bone]
Ooooh, yeah
They back, finna hit yall with that mighty real good, ooooh
No doubt about it
You bound to feel it good
We still hood, even though we came up
Changed the whole game up
No matter how much they angry steady saying we aint the same.
Pointing the blame at us
The only thing is Imma go get it even if I gotta split your wig
They cant get enough of my style cause I got the job well done winning it winnin it
Big ups to all of my hustlers
While the globe spinnin, it aint time to sleep
Break me off a piece of that paradise pie
Til the day I die, Imma represent my peeps
Hit up food from all of this
Somebody sneak they piece
Nothin but heat for the streets
Now turn up that Bone beat beat
They tried to hold me, but couldnt keep me down cause Flesh got a whole world of my trues to be found

[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]

[Verse 3 - Bizzy Bone]
You owe me money, man
If not I gotta get my respect
Its too many years of grindin
Baby mama want my royalty checks
It aint about Twista
But nobody flippin their tongue like Ripsta
No nigga done caused my earthquake like march
Remember that way little Capo got hurt when
My niggas is hurtin daily
Good thing Wally see me and Krayzie
They would have just left them hailin
And there were shots in the melee
It was never to protect myself
little Layzie got em baby!
And I pop, popped everyone else
Tanks swell over the double
Me problems tends again and never left
When I see the face of Zee
Bothers me, backn yo step!
You never could feel my wepts remember that
Would never have got dissed with Bone
Off to another dimension
You owe me, but Im on my own
Now come on!

[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]

[Verse 4 - Krayzie Bone]
YEAH!
Still chasin that paper, dawg
And I wont slow down til I done made it all
They better give me whats mine
Imma get it then go grind
Get up in it one mo time time
Better ask about my rep
Better check yourself, self, self
They mustve thought I was somebody else, body else
Yeah, everybody better ? little bit of Bone Thugs
Bet theyll never own us
We originated that there, sho nuff
Better run and go get they flow heard
Came from Cleveland, Ohio
The realest that I know
Theyll never sound nothin like Bone, clones!
Them faders, the greatest, and even the haters is singin
Yeah we make em zone
We make em sing, sing!
No matter what they say
Everybody, all know Bone changed the game, game, game
We made them sing like me
Against the grain, grain, grain
If they dont wanna respect me and where I come from
I tell em they can run on up, come on over and get chu some, get chu some, some

[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]
