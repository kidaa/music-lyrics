
It's so many ways to die. Oh no! It's so many ways to fly.
Steady as we roll. It's so many ways to ride.
Cause life can't pass us by no more.

Chillin on my mamas front porch, I'm watchin. Sittin here reminiscing on how hot the block gets. From right here I can truly see how crooked the cops is. My vision gettin blurry as I look at my options. I can just let em drop me, or I can cock it and pop it. The way they murdered Oscar was proposterous nonsense. They talkin with they glocks, conversation is violence, and they wonder why society is criminal-minded. They never gon' change, come around my way. Another one shot down, slain, while the cop got praise. It's hard to maintain when they supposed to protect us. You or me could be the next one bleedin, injustice.

Even though the world shows no affection, you gotta keep it movin, gotta keep on steppin.
The Man Upstairs is our only protection. It's very necessary you remember this is temporary.

Times tickin' all day, let me swoop up in your neck of the woods. Everybody tend to they own hustle, got much respect, that's all good. Turn on the news, it's no surprise to see police brutality, and worse they out here gunnin us down in the street. Abuse of authority ain't even it, rather the vast majority of 'em is too damn incompetent. When is enough gon' be enough, I ask? I know we all tryin to live life free from all the madness. It's sad enough you gotta watch how they get jacked. But the worst ones the criminal that's hidin behind the badge. You got a problem, it may be a waste of time to call em, 'cause the only thing they bringin' is more problems, so why bother?

Political think I'm illiterate, little ol' me-I get so cynical. It's pitiful livin in minimal. Generals animals stick with their tentacle. I'm more alive, I just try to fight evil. Me and my people, my people and me. I'm still single. And even though I look meager, I'm eager to make some money. My heart is more than a direction, my protection from dummies. Hold your hand like babies, feel my hand gettin stuck. Josiah acted a fool. Rasu, 7th Sign, What?!

I'm lookin around the world, my temporary city, it makes my heart hurt. Feelin the struggles of my brothers, it takes some hard work. Bein raised by single mothers, the case was caught first. And they got daddy in the pen, gotta face the laws worst. No guidance, we dyin, we barely survivin. The knowledge is there, they ain't providin. They starvin us out to keep us divided so they can get money and hide it. Operation Silence. The government got some secrets they ain't tellin, 'cause if they'd let you know then they can't convict you, felon. But they done slipped and let the thugs know the deal. We comin back to save the ghetto; let the truth be revealed. And if we all get on the level and exhibit some skills, we can all get outta debt and we can pay up these bills and just chill.
