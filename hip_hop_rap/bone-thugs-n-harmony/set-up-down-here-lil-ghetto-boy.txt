[Wish's Verse]
Niggas in the pen why the crack brings more then nine to five bring it in,
like doorways, monkeys cage. come with that hustle but they take it away,
Legally, mommies with no daddies workin hard. still ain't got much. why they blame us, I was born here still gonna take to the give up, but when the good comes to bad never had gots to get it by all means moving things or the other way try to get a job but they check on my felonys over me hold me back, hit the corner grave till mornin look at a whole lil nigga holding them stacks, my choices are, take orders work for scraps. Or hit up the boulevard supply my clientele work my spots life is to short take it to livining poor, pour my drinks right now, While I'm young reckless and naughty, rowdy
