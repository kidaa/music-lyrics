Lay your head on my shoulder
Everything is gonna be alright
Baby don't you cry
Baby don't you worry 'bout a thing
I see a rainbow at the end
It's gonna be alright
So many problems around me
Dammit won't they just go away
Every night I pray, yeah
Lord won't you come my way
Won't you come and rescue me
Help me see the light

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
When the fires get out, can you turn 'em off
Can you turn 'em off

I've tried so hard to make it
Tried to do the best I could
Tried to do some good,yea
Like the people that I could
Like my family if you would
Trying to live a better life
Fake friends always around me
Trying to be up in my scoop
Acting like they're cool, yea
They don't know that I ain't blind
So stop trying to waste my time
And go on with your bull, yeah

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
When the fires get out, can you turn 'em off
Can you turn 'em off

Cada vez que siento que el mundo se me esta cerrando
Solo pienso en escaparme del mal
Y cada vez que siento que el aire se me esta acabando pienso en volar
Hasta donde nadie me pueda encontrar

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
When the fires get out, can you turn 'em off
Can you turn 'em off
