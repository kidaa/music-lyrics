It feels like only yesterday that you was lying here with me
I still hear you say...ooo yea
I love the way you say...ooo yea
But now it's just a memory
Now I'm knowing that it was my fault
By thinking I could brush it off
You always with me saying...ooo yea
So when it's 5 A.M. I'm checkin' in when I check in
Baby I was thinking I was so slick
Knowing that I've done you wrong
But you never know what you've got
Til what you've got is gone

Gotta try to make it through
Without you
And there's nothing I can do
Come on home baby

I remember coming home that night
Knowing something was right
I was saying...ooo yea
I'm sure that all her things were packed
And it's just too late to get her back
Didn't even have to read the note
Just to know that your heart was broke
I was thinking...ooo yea
You had more than you can stand
I should have been a better man
Baby I was thinking I was so slick
Girl I was doing you so wrong
You never know what you've got
Til what you've got is gone

Gotta try to make it through
Without you
And there's nothing I can do
Come on home baby

I'm so sorry for the things I've done
Should've put you number one
But I've been playing myself
Cause I know that you're all I want
But if you give me one more chance
I'll break it down for you lady
No more playing around
Baby I wanna be there for you
Gonna make it through

Gotta try to make it through
Without you
And there's nothing I can do
Come on home baby
