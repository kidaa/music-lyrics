Hello sweetheart, so how was your day
Well I'm just sittin' here
Thinkin' of you...
I feel like I'm a go crazy...

I can't stand no other minute
Away from your heart
I just wanna get on
The first plane home
And head straight into your arms
Yeah...

I know you miss me shorty
I'm missin' you too...
So I swear and I promise
That I will be there
That I'll be home soon...yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be home soon...
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helping our relattion
So I'd rather be there with you...oh
I'll be home soon...
It's just these time got me stressin'
And I haven't been so patient
Cuz I'd rather be there with you oh...

[Verse 2]
Listen now darlin'...

Easy for you babe
But i know we're going to make it
Through this rain yeah...

And it's hard for me too
But I've got to work hard
