[Chorus:]
Sometimes da game got me stressin partner i can't lie
I roll me a sweet smash off n da ride a whole piece i aint never lied
I put my weed hand n da sky
I put my weed hand n da sky
I respect it for da luv of life
A whole piece i aint never lied
I put my weed hand in da sky
I put my weed hand in da sky

[V1:]
The smokes killing off my lungs and appendix.It's baby bash the modern day jimmy hendrix.deep
down in texas,dope house is so relentless.the fluff is endless.smokin wit my lawer and my
dentist.Feelin stupendiss wanna come to my quarter stacks.Smokin on greener reef.singing boby
to dem older cats.bobby brownDem dolger sax,wit a coffee grinder at my mercy.Dun rolled a
lax wit a highspeed chasers ones dat coudn't curch me.Cocked mouthed and thirsty gotta keep my
spirit lifted though.My spiritual,lyrical,it's hydromyrical.I'm comin visious though,wit a
