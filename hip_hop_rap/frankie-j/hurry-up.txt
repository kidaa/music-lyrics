I looked at him 
He looked at me 
I still had one leg out my jeans 
where do I go 
Running through my head 
I guess I should've listened when she said 

Hurry up 
Grab your shoes 
Hurry up 
Grab your clothes 
Hurry up 
Cause my man should be home 
Hit the street 
Hurry up 
Disappear 
Hurry up 
Gotta get outta here 
Baby, he's crazy, 
maybe he'll kill you 
Leave your number 
I'll Call you 
Whatever you just need to 
Just Leave 

Hurry up 
Grab your shoes 
Hurry up 
Grab your clothes 
Hurry up 
Cause my man should be home 
Hit the street 
Hurry up 
Disappear 
Hurry up
