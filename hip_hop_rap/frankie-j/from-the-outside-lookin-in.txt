Yo I want to dedicate 
This song to everyone out there who's goin through the same thing Just keepin it real yo
Listen...

Well she was 5 foot 3
Unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful...
That had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her
I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be 
Happy till the end with her
So you live in learn
That's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words... yeah
I should've listened to your words...yeah

From that long conversation
We had long ago
'Bout the same situation
I be goin through
From a friend to a friend
You would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all
I thought she loved me
She wasn't good at all
I really really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all
How could I have been such a fool To never listen to your words...yeah!
She wasn't good at all
I should've never, never, never Stayed with her yeah...!

I told you from the beginning
About this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same
Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls
These type of girls
They come and go
Remember when we talked about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation
We had long ago
'Bout the same situation
I be goin through
From a friend to a friend
You would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all
I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all
I know you knew but I never listened to you no 
She wasn't good at all
You know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all
I should've listened to your words

Yo we must of had a different vision of love
Tender kisses and hugs
Making me weak in my knees
That's how vicious it was...I'm From the gutter girl
You know it's vicious for thugs...
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us...
I used to miss you so much
I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties gave you the simple
Life...call me the family Man...getting my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard
That's when reality bites
And leave an open wound...greed got Your cover blown...but I be over you

And I would of known...you do your Thang I ain't concerned baby girl I'm gone
