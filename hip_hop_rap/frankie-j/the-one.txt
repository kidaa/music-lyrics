[Chorus:]
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me

Won't you come and put it on me
Baby you're the one for me

Now I'm not sure
If I'm applying myself so good on you
But I must say that I be checkin' you out when you roll through my hood
Got everybody like, damn, who's that, introduce me
What's her name, who she with, she a cutie
What she doin', what she lookin' like that
Well she with me as a matter of fact
She's my girl, my chic, ridin' with me in my whip
She's my boo, me friend, so with her I get my freak on

Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Won't you come and put it on me
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one boy
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me
Won't you come and put it on me

She's the one
He's the one

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my baby to keep
It's his touch, his smile, his sweater, his style
He's fly and he's all mine
I don't mind, he's out late at night
He's my best friend, I trust him
So promise me, you'll always do me right
He's my boo, my man
Riding with me til the end
He's my boy, my friend
See with him I get's my freak on

Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Won't you come and put it on me
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one boy
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me
Won't you come and put it on me

She's the one
He's the one

She my homie lover friend
And I'll love her til the end
I'm so glad that she's the one for me, oh yea
She's my homie lover friend
She's a dime a perfect ten
And I'm glad that she's the one for keeps

Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one girl
Won't you come and put it on me
Baby you're the one for me
You're the one boy
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me
Won't you come and put it on me

She's the one
He's the one

The special things you do 
Oh baby you're the one
Yea you know you're my boo
