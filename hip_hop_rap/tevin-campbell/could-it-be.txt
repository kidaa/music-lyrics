I do believe It's somethin
I do believe it's you
Can't be without you baby
Not even for a night
And so I've been thinking lately
Of being with you for all time
Could it be, could it be something
Could it be, it's got to be something
Could it be, could it be something
That something I found is you
Can't wait to see you baby
I know you're there alone
And I was thinking maybe
I could leave work and come home
Could it be, could it be something
Could it be, it's got to be something
Could it be, could it be something
That something I found is you
Like a flower in the garden of love
Like a star that shines from heaven up above
Would you carry me to the garden of love
Ain't no telling girl what's waiting there for us
Could it be, could it be something
Could it be, it's got to be something
Could it be, could it be something
That something I found is you
I really know that this is something
I really know that this is true
I really know that this is something
I know for sure that it is you
