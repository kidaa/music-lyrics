Yeah!
VERSE 1:
Another man has broke your heart
You run to me
to ease your pain, yeah
Why can't you see it in my eyes
That I'm in love and I want to make you mine, so
We can't be lovers cause you think you'll loose your friends
That's what try to tell me time and time again, but no way
Nobody knows you quite the way that I know you
And you know that I'm tired of watching my baby cry, so dry your eyes
CHORUS:
Baby, dry your eyes
There's no need for you to cry
So baby, dry your eyes
I'll be theere for you always
VERSE 2:
I often lay and visualize
How sweet it'd be
Just you and me, babe
Us side by side and hand in hand
Ooh, it would be so nice if only you give me a chance
We can't be lovers 'cause you think you'll loose your friends
By now you got know that I'll be here until the end
Nobody knows you quite the way that I know you
And you know that I'm tired of watching my baby cry, so dry your eyes
CHORUS
I'll never give up trying I'll never give up trying
One day you'll be my girl You'll be my girl
Until then
We're just friends, yeah
I'll be right there to dry your eyes
CHORUS
