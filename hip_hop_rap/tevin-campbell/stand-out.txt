Open up your eyes, take a look at me,
If the picture fits in your memory!
I'm driven by the rythm like the beat of a heart,
And I won't stop until I start, Stand Out!
Stand Out
Some people settle for the typical thing,
Living all their lives wading in the waste.
It ain't no question of it, just a matter of time,
Before I move to the front of the line!
Unless your watchin' every move that I make,
Ya gotta believe that I got what it takes,
To Stand Out, above the crowd,
Even if I've gotta shout out loud.
To mind is the only, things you see,
Gonna stand out, 'til you notice me!
If the stick you wield is always getting the breeze,
I'm souly devoted to disturbing the peace.
And I'll do it all again, when I get done.
Until I become your number 1.
No method sees the madness as a means of escape,
Gonna break every ruler,
Bend 'em all outta shape.
It ain't no question of how, just a matter of when,
You get the message that I'm tryin' to sing.
I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head.
And you know I'm going all of the way to the end!
To Stand out, above the crowd,
Even if I've got to shout out loud.
To mind is the only, things you see.
Gonna stand out, 'til you notice me, yeah.
Uh huh
If I can make you stop and take a look at me instead of just
Walking by
There's nothing that, I wouldn't do, if it was getting you to notice
I'm alive
All I need is half a chance on second thought of second glass of roo,
I got whatever it takes.
It's a piece of cake
To stand out, above the crowd.
Even if I gotta SHOUT out loud.
To mind is the only, things you see, gonna,
Stand out, stand out, yea.
Stand out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stand out, mmmm.
To mind is the only, things you see,
Gonna STAND OUT,
'Til ya notice me!
