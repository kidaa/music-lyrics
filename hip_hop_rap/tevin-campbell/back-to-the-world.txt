VERSE 1:
I know you're thinkin'
That I've been better off without you by my side
But baby, this season
I don't want another cold rainy July
BRIDGE:
You would think that I've been better now
But I'm not!
'Cause I don't have you, yeah, yeah
You would think that I've been better now
But I'm not!
'Cause I don't have you, baby, yeah, yeah
CHORUS:
Come back to the world
Come back to the world
Baby, back to my world
Come back to the world
Come back to the world
Baby, back to my world
VERSE 2:
And I still remember
The way you used to gently touch my face
And since last December
I discovered that no one can take your place
BRIDGE
CHORUS
And when the night gets lonely
I think of what you told me
Saying that I was the one
Da, da, da, day
Da, da, da, dome
Da, da, da, day
Da, da, da, dome
Tell me if you feel it once again
I know that we can love like we did then
Bring it on home
CHORUS
