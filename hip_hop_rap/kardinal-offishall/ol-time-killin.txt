INTRO [Korry Deez]
E'rebody on top of sound killing
When they dun know, we are original sound killer
Fosse-will you know we
Anytime we start dance-dance off the lot
Girl follow back of we
We have e'rething pon cock
Girl chant to me
We start dance from 19-0-long
Pick a only firefighter a we collect
A dub plate we have
Anytime we drop Kardinal, IRS and Wio
A blood clot big tune dat

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yes
Oh me oh me oh my what
Them a try run Mr. Kardi-ni, flavours you can't deny what
'Cause them Circle cats rhyme so fly
Them tracks stay do or die and what as what
When them write a murder song before a cats can't turn around
I jump and beg for they live what
Lick off a style, me-a-fi put dem all back
Rap from T-dot to the Bronx and Bricks then I come back
Will you wake me up

[Wio-K]
If an emcee step outta line, fill them mouth get cut up
Butta, lick a fist sound get bigger
Beat up and kick up until they boy start sicker
Girlfriend what's your name
I ya look, so sweet with your horse legs acting like you're strange
It's full time, now you come off on dat range
My name's Wio, bareback rhyming in the plains

[Allistair]
Blessin' this, effortless, mess with this, eff with this
If you think you got a chance to do me with your devilish messages
Stressing this can only lead to battery
You rattle me, request to battle me I take as flattery
I see ya, grip your bible
I'm the lyrically homicidal idol, who's liable to take your title with a single or silence vital
You respect the steez, I get vexed with ease
Don't make me ask to respect me please

CHORUS [Jully Black  amp; BlackKat]
It's an old time, ol' time killing
We a deal with, run and get your money clip
For another day in another way
Dem man, no a take the ray ray
We are a murderahs
   quot;The MC... quot;  lt;-- KRS-One
Killas
   quot;Murder she wrote quot;  lt;-- Chaka Demur  amp; Pliers
   quot;Murderers quot;
   quot;When  come to mash out to the champion sound quot;

[BlackKat]
Yo, 1-8-7
Cold blood I meant to do it ruthless
Knew it was murder since Da Grassroots produced it
Now we got some ax-murderers upon the track
Burning murder onto wax
So you can witness the attack, it's Black... Kat
The nigga who writes to burn flavour
So hype the Source should give us 5 mics and 2 turntables
We spitting this with beats so ridiculous
And rhyme style limitless, let's see if they can get with this
[Kardinal Offishall]
Wio - you're crazy, your tough talk don't amaze me
Imaginary gats busting just don't faze me
Lick a shot, wave your flag, gunfinga in the air
Headstone on your 12 quot; says Mr. Kardinal and the Monolith was there
From '94 to now, the beats run wild in the East
Leaving 'nuff man decease, I got two middle fingers that's made for 5-0
Babylon forget dust and let my people dem go

CHORUS

[Kardinal Offishall]
Call me a sound killa, gut filla, rhyme spilla
Don't date vanilla, hip hop guerilla
Mind chilla, don't drink Miller Lite
Night thrilla, spite might fill ya
Bite and you invite with a recite to kill ya

[Wio -K]
The tox licker, shot licker
Girls flock quicker, since my crop got bigger
Get yanked like a glock trigger, just to make the plot thicker
Girls got thicker, I'm run up in the spot licker
Don't let them watch me so
I'm the nigga your son really wants to chill with and know
You must think it's me that make that nigga act so
Vexed 'cause your church friends gossip on the low
Wio - let me say
Now for the people who don't know what's gwaning
They sleeping on the whole city, stretching in your heart
Not knowing that T-dot's about to shake your ass out your dreams
So wake up before you end up in a pine box
Seen

CHORUS

   quot;When  come to mash out to the champion sound quot;
You better run go and get your money clip

[Jully Black]
Run go get your money clip
Run go get your money clip
The emcee killa, killa killa
