chorus
i get it done 
make it one make it two make it three 
right before it happens
make it four make it five make it 6 7 8 9 
ten 
come  on motherfucka we can do it again 
repeat

See i aint never had shit 
but  my strife and my game and my life 
and all thems is just hand downs from my granddaddy lidvens 
for them whose black folks ever came to here 
to steal and hustling food stamps for that nine to 4 caddy
how many days can i stretch this box of grits 
shit never quits im a brother 
pitching fits or pitching shit 
i use my mouth or a leg muscle anything to make the rent, 
yo give up the hustle. 
I know the us economy and i could run it 
im about to make these four dollars into 4 hundred 
aint nothing  happening but this serious game 
while they got billions in the bank 
we just got money on the deck 
and when we got fresh rims we on top,
on top of what when the kitchen's table's on hock
gun uncocked but we seen it on the past 
make a fast dash for the cash be gangsta leaning on your ass 
twentys and tens its all about making ends
no need to sin to uplift a california living 
but i'd rear cos err i remember as a tot mr ogs
skank you motherfuckars with the glocks 
and now the rocks is in my pockets 
and my spots hot like the haiwaiian tropics
a taskforce topic cos this one's a cya
even though the yay is brought in by the cia 
see im a motherfuckas thats done some dirt for my meal ticket 
but i learned quit you gots to deal with it
well i dealed for twentytwofucking years
you damn straight my homies been laid when we all shed a tear 
and its clear to my ear i had to learn that knowledge
cos after 12th grade i had to say fuck college 
and the knowledge no longer will i waste my time 
the chrome was stuck in my ear 
but im stuck to the ground
im steady mobbing 
back to the police station,
they checking me but its inflation thats doing this  taking
no hesistating cant be waiting let me do my thing 
i was hooked like a fiend but now im hip to tha skeme


 chorus


i heard recognized game when its in your face
im spitting the game so close to you 
you could feel the wet trace 
if everybody in the hood had a phd 
youd  say that dr flip that burger hell it good for me
200thousand brothers watching one mind one place to go
aint no revolution they just walking to the liquor store
here take a swigger so its quicker round the niggerroe
just wanna get rich the rigamole i been here before 
a typical ho aint really no different
except that she would know that caint no prostitute 
can become a pimp up in this system 
it'd be more drama than a soap opera daytime spot 
but aint no twist up in this cemetery plot 
since nineteen fiftyfour 
i's been hustling for that dough 
my girl been putting out cross that wick like she's a specialized pro 
this shit is getting steep
im getting ill ready to kill 
the only thing i can inherit is an overdue bill 
now its six in the morning
i stride to the ride 
as i glide down the street 
i cant  get to park ? 
cos my gas is kissing heat
im not yet free
but you dont hear me though
unlesss you creeping soap as my drive through window
now if you wondering bout my fucked up fickle frown 
is cos im thinking bout how the wealth dont trickle down 
listen to that beat nickle pound is my homies in the back 
pass the nickle bag around and im looking at the street 
through the fogged up windows knowing if i was walking 
id be smelling stench or piss or stale pussy in your window 
i ask when those stores get closed down 
a system that eats itself got it looking like a ghost town 
no proof of purchase hear my essence purchase proof 
analyze how they fucked us like if i was dr ruth  
im on proof with the truth they started with nothing 
robbed and ganked and killed 
aint no po folks getting rich 
less some caps is getting picked 
except for a couple of motherfuckas who done live their 
token seen lifestyles of the rich and famous 
front page of the magazine but that's a known 
trick tell them suck their own dick 
im hip to the skeme 
my fist will bring up the whole clique.
