[Spice-1]
stepping up out of my cell  
with santos and county blues handcuffs and shackles 
gonna ride up on that grey goose, 
coming out of a case 
cos i was strapped with my nines 
they see these drawers that im wearing

excuse me homie can i hit that mista
niggas blowing up in the while a toilet tissue 
aint this a bitch some niggas are scared to here

so phone check 
nigga get the fuck off the line 
before i stick your ass in here and have to do some more timeplayer
want to give me the strap cos i was strapped with a glock
i guess i got to sit my black ass right there and get shot see 
fool 
but fool it aint no going out 
see i keep scoring clout 
and show these niggas what im all about 
see niggas screaming from cell to cell 
snitches dont tell a party in hell a santa rita county jail 

[E-Roc]
everytime i turn around everytime i look
im considered to be a murderer a crook, 
Ali shook the world im gonna shake my homies hand 
three in the morning dressed in blue once again 
my size ten rest upon the concrete floor
heads bob real slow to a freestyle flow
i dont know this masterplan cant understand
why there's more black folks in jail than japenese in japan 
but err my eyes pink 
sitting upon that bunk
thinking about them tickets
choking up on that funk chunk 
withca a snicker from my commisary bank 
sunday monday came fool im out this home change 
but it makes me think the systems treating us like a merry go round 
one day you're chilling at home    
the next you headed down 
sam peace to my hounds in the county in the pen 
once again its a santa rita weekend

chorus: 2X

just sitting up on the top bunk 
watching the cell block row. 

[E-40]

penelope's gots me on the floor 
accused of robbing a store

without the advisory of my lawyer mr baker

is it my turn to tell the tale 
of how i got popped and how my lawyer failed to get me out 
on the slight spot cell block my homies give me love 
some here for having gacks
some here for selling drugs
sometimes you do your shit 
and aint no second tries 
look around theres hell of motherfuckas that i recognize 
oh whats up man im back again 
but its a temporary situation

and motherfuckas cant ignore it

in the pen gotta warrant
