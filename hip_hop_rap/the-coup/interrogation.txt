i mean the fizz i mean my daddy told me who you was 
i mean the wiz  I mean

ease on down the road we got a dont speak to cops code

thats why i never watched roberta and i hated huggie bear
even scooby doo snitched with that hippy ass van 
but me i know the scoop  i know the plan

you know the deal the real criminals who dressed in suit and ties 
who holds the wealth you do more damage than health 
so for me and my folks we gonna just do for self 
i dont know shit about those stolen goods

i got disturbed fool i'm not your mocking bird
the only words coming out of my mouth is a lyrical thang
so please back tha fuck up off my screen  tho

the community took four steps higher
86ing motherfuckas working for the suppliers 
so sayonara before you catch a cap in your ass 
no more questions in here so dont ask  


chorus 
you want peace motherfucka 
raise up out of the hood repeat 


well all the tattletalers and undercover dwellers 
they are here to be placed into helicopter propellers 
and the narcotic snatched up by the seat of his pants 
his face was driven into a hill of army ants 
the man had the murder for his benz and his face
i never saw the assailant he vanished through the mists
";you know the faces and names all your stories are polluted 
tell me the truth before i have you electrocuted";
attempting on my person wouldnt be the wise thing
in your thoughts you have fear of my peoples uprisings
the masses rebel your aircraft propels 
a cop was shot seven rounds were expelled 
went straight right to hell just for being a fascist  
burned uniforms and piles of human ashes
";your making this difficult so for being a bastard
 i'll have you charged for murderer and resisting arrest";
I never did resist you're telling 4 smiths 
shes swung with the sticks so i made a  spinal column twist
twist one came with a body blow to osaygefo 
and he struck my abdominals and fractured his hand 
rebels away through the twigs blasted their wigs 
and there you will find a red ocean of pigs 
stay away from my zone 
where it starts and it ends
that's how we murder policemen upon planet 10
step into this 8 by 10 
im getting nervous you feel me point blank
yo i feel the coppers came to serve us 
but now here he comes
stepping through the fucking dough
and we dont know who smoked that motherfucking cop at the liquor store 
but now you creep through the hood looking for a clue 
but your bob head twice with the point blank crew 
running up my bumper for late registration 
taking me to that station for interrogation 
and i guess i'm just supposed to just let my tongue run
asking me shit that would get my mother hung 
but where im from up in my hood the shit wont raise 
if a brother is constantly tripping that would be his arse
but now you wanna creep up on me and threaten me with time 
while you got the billy club pointed at my spine 
with things nowadays aint the same like they  used to be
doing time for contempt aint new to me  
i never feared going down with my whole damn crew 
only thing that i fear is ever fucking with you
well i too took a beating from the boys in blue 
and all cops watched like a pay per view
and unless you're referring to this incident
we dont know nothing and we aint seen shit
get it 

chorus
