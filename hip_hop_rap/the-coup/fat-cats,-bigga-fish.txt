Well now haha what have we here? 

chorus
c-c-c-come with it 
get down get down get down 2ce
repeat

It's almost ten o clock see i got a ball of lifted property 
so i slid my beenie hat on sloppily
and promenade out to take up a collection 
i got game like i read the directions
i 'm wishing that i had an automobile
as i feel the cold wind rush past
but let me state that i am a hustler for real 
so you know i got the stolen bus pass
just as the bus pulls up and i step to the rear 
this ole lady look like she drank a forty of fear
i see my ole school partner said his brother got popped 
pay my respects
can you ring the bell we came to my stop 
the street light reflects off the piss on the ground
which reflects off the hamburger sign as it turns round
which reflects off the chrome of the bmw 
which reflects off the fact that i am broke 
now what the fuck is new
i need loot i sweat the motherfucka 
in the tweed suit 
and i'm on his ass quicker than a kick from a grease boot 
eased up slow and discreet
could tell he was suspicious by the way he slid his feet
didn't wanna fuck up the come on
so i smiled with my eyes  said hey how it's hanging guy
bumped into his shoulders but he passed with no reaction
damn this motherfucka had a hella of andrew jacksons
i'm a thief or pickpocket give a fuck what you call it 
used to call em fat cats. 
i just call them wallets getting federal  aint just a klepto
master card or visa i'd gladly accept those 
sneaky motherfucka with a scam know how to pull it 
got a mirror in my pocket but that wont stop no bullets
story just begun but you already know 
aint no need to get down shit i'm already low


chorus


My footsteps echo in the darkness
my teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist
i look down and i hear my somach growling 
step to burger king to attack it like a shaolin 
i never pay for shit that i can get by doing dirt
link up to the girl cashier and start to flirt 
all up in her face and her breath was like murder
damn the shit i do for a free hamburger 
girl ";well you got my number you gonna call me tonite";
it depends is them burgers attached to a price
 ";sorry sorry"; 
im just kidding i'ma call you write you love letters 
";it's all good";
 thanks for the burgers emm hook me up with a dr pepper. 
girlthats cool you want some ice 
yeah and some fries will be hella nice 
girl damn my managers coming play it off okay have a nice day
 im up outta here anyway
i use peoples before they use me
cos you could get got by an uzi over an oz
thats what an og told me
gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the vittles that i just got 
came to an underground parking lot 
this place is good as any fuck its all good 
walked in found a car hopped itself up on a hood 
ate my burger threw back my cola
somebody said hey it was a rented pig i thought it was a roller 
";want me to call the cops?";
 i dont want them to see me 
looked down and saw that i was sitting on a lamboughini 
it was rollses ferraris and jags by the dozen 
a building door opened
 damn it was my cousin 
 getting offa work dressed up no lie
  tux  cummerband and a blackbow tie 
i was like hey
 ";who is it";

 ";oh whats up man i just quit this company 
 they hella racist and the pay was too low ";
 i said arite what was up in there though 
";a party with rich motherfuckas i dont know the situation 
i know they got cabbage owning corporations
ibm chryslers and shit is what they seeing";
just then a light bulb went off in my head
they be thinking all black folks is resembling
gimme your tux and i'll do some pocket swindling 
fit the change in the bathroom  and i freeze off my nuts 
lets take a short break 
while i get into this tux
grunt zipp 
alright i'm ready


chorus


Fresh dressed like a million bucks 
i be the flyiest muthafucka in an afro and a tux
my arm is at a right angle up silver tray in my hand
 may i interest you in some caviar mam
my eyes shoots round the room there and here 
noticing the diamonds in the chandelier 
background barry manilow copacobana 
and a strong ass scent of stoagies from havana
what no place where a brother might been 
snobby ole ladies drinking champagne with rich white men
allrite then lets begin this
nights like this is good for business
five minutes in the mix noticed several diffrent cliques 
talking  giggling and shit  
well one mother fucka gave me twits
and everbody else jacking it throttling 
found out later you know coca cola bottling 
talking to a black man who he's confused
 we looking hella bourgie 
 ass all tight and seditty 
recognzed him as the mayor of my city 
who treats young black man like frank nitty 
mr coke said to mr mayor ";you know we got a process like ice t's hair
we put up the fund for your election campaign 
and oh um waiter can you bring the champagne";
a real estate fronts as opportunities arousing
to make some condos out of low income housing 
immediately we need some media heat 
to say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet
harrasing me everbody till they  look inebriated
 when we bought the land motherfuckas will appreciate it 
dont worry about the urban league or jesse jackson 
my man that owns marlboros 
donated a fat sum
thats when i step back some to contemplate what few know 
sat down wrestle with my thoughts like a sumo
aint no one player that could beat this lunancy 
aint no hustler on the street could do a whole community 
this is how deep shit can get 
it reads macaroni on my birth certificate 
poontang is my middle name but i cant hang 
i'm getting hustled 
only knowing half the game
shit how the fuck do i get out of this place.
