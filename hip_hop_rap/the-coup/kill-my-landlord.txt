Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?
Verse One: ?

Now check it, the topic of discussion 
Is more than a financial profit
United Snakes won't stop it
Blow for blow, the flow with the commentary gets
Seventy-six septillion tons a-spinnin'
[Steady steppin into a new phase
New thoughts representing our slavery days]
The seeds of weeds and crops is much more than you figure
Yo if he's a black man he must be a nigger
They make a gimmick I wouldn't doubt 
[A sucker selling out for the sake of a scream and shout]
Elements don't grow with nonsense
Rather kick a little bit of science
[Science about controlling actions of another
America was built on the sweat of black sisters and brothers]
Never allowed to breathe but allowed to bleed and breed
[Stripped of our creed and religion surviving on intuition]
And what the master said give 'em
[And besides the black man is the original lord of the land]
So I'm clenching my right hand
[Brothers and sisters we must fight this slumlord]
Overlord of the concrete jungle but I'm humble
As I witness my opponent crumble
Like the shack that I live in the house that I rent from him
[Roach infested I'm sure that the rats are nesting
The heat doesn't work he still hasn't checked it
Disrespected me for the last time
I loaded up the nine stepping double time
Bullseye]
Another point scored
Right between the eyes of my landlord

Verse Two:  Defrost

They tell me to hold my peace but I just can't
But I'm Defrost of the rap group of Point Blank
So me I'm chilling at the table
