1986 a motherfucker doin tricks on the mix and I don't mean the fader
Face of zits but gettin grits with black steel firesticks
Drama buildin Empire somethin like Darth Vader
Now Lonzo was armed with nuttin but a mean mug
But tucked a forty-five, with forty-five slugs
He was a jitterbug thug, at the dance, cuttin a rug
Treatin his sisters like a hooker Greetin his partners with a hug
Breakdown shakedown, this brother would take a pound
of some soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protectin wads of gorgeous greens
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a key
Rocks were cookin but he's lookin for a way to be free
Here's a key there's a key but Lonzo, where's yours?
There's no key to the door, but there's money on the floor
So stoop down Bend over hurry pick it up fast
But watch out, Lonzo -- YOU'LL GET FUCKED IN THE ASS

";A bad, a bad, a bad bad man!";
	";Do, do, you know dis kid?";
LONZO!
repeat 4X
LONZO!

Knock knock who is it? time to visit but it's two years later
Cause Lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
He's got some fat he's got some mo' greens and a brand new Benz
He's got respect and he suspects that it won't end
A couch is still a couch and a chair is still a chair
But a house is now a crackhouse Luther, Lonzo's there
Dying brains, dying bodies, too and from these dead residence
Try in vain to kill they pain, exchangin, dead presidents
Many bourgeoise parlei francoise I don't speak it but I know it
It's all the same the business game but you go to jail for this shit
We were tribal our survival was now based on stoppin rivals
Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists up can't survive and not be ruthless
So why be straight, and scratch the bones
 And a cellular phone, somebody's sittin on the throne
 Cause they don't let, black folks own
THEY JUST GIVE US THIS SHIT ON LOAN, KICK IT

";A bad, a bad, a bad bad man!";
	";Do, do, you know dis kid?";
LONZO!
repeat 4X
LONZO!

Ahahaha, what was I finished saying?
Aww yeah Lonzo's back in the County man
Damn we'll go visit him on Sunday when we visit Dee aight?

Madge says that Bounty is the quicker-picker-upper
Well Lonzo says the County is the slipper, tripper, stucker
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
 on my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, predict it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ";Here's the ticket";
Now he's addicted to learnin how we been afflicted
And what distributin that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, ";Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob"; You had a government job
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night
Now he hangs with us poor revolutionary brothers
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us
Just cause we know the road to riches is crooked and narrow
WE'LL GET MORE POWER FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND GUN BARRELS
