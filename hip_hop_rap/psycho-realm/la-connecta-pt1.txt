Sonny:
now i'm tired of makin' all these other mothafuckas money
while they sit back and leave it all up to sonny
it's been a long time i've worked for these lying pieces of shit
now i'm trying to make my own grip
for so long, i've been number two
fuck that. i got to break of and make my own crew
im tired of being held back and lied to 
like a vato with no respect see what i do
jakin' the old fool and takin' over everything
and every mothafucka with 'em gotta die too
it's time for a change of power
i planted two gaurds on the watch tower

dialogue

Joaquin:
im the vato's right hand man, main man, gato
and when he goes out, im takin' over the scam
i ran a little block for tax, everybody for static control
now i hold a position for sure
over those who roll they get in my way they lay
im a hole tryin' to tamper goal
tryin' to move in like this cuban thinks it's his spot
but ther's no room for the two at the top
word is he's tryin' to serve this organization
for the unnotted service
the boss is getting nervous
this is my chance to advance; im getting cynical
this guy being alive makes the situation critical

dialogue

gus:
why am i being shacked in chains
they claim i am wanted murderous assist man
at first i thought it was a government scheme
sticking me at the center of the crime scene
it seems i've been held for, being helpful
in a homicide; why'd they try to give me life double
when i was madewasn't i made untouchable
by my family?give my life to crime committe
now in a time of need, you're saying fuck me
what makes you wanna play me shady
i protected your life, now im offered as sacrifice
to the law with no ties at all
when the boss dies, he whole kingdom falls
