fuck 
sometimes I just wish I could sleep it off
cause i dream about things that I know that i can't have
thing i know will never happen 
like a safe enviroment money happiness sucess
niggas want static than he going to get it 
i came up with blood money that means 
i'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos 
so they call me a baller i wiped a niggaz ass 
because I'm not a talker 
took a flight to kali came back with some birds 
ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt 
I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip 
shot a fool up in the club and then i changed my outfit
maintain and uphold my statis as a g 
niggaz kiss my ass because i got alot of money
plain and simple niggaz leave huh when i don't feel'em 
because they know when they fuck up then i'm going to kill'em 
understand i was rasied where the young niggaz roam
if you wanted something nigga you had to get up on your own 
all these want to be motherfucken 
ass hustlers better wake up and stop killing on another 
cause
chorus 2x
I wish that life was a dream 
cause some times i wake up 
and just want to scream 
i live amounst the cut throats and the killers 
lord don't let my son be another victim
