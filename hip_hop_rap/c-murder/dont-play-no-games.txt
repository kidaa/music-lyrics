you don't wanna fuck with me just a bunch of bad motherfuckers
you don't wanna go to war bunch of bad motherfuckers
[C-Murder]
Don't play no games, cuz boy we be bout killin'
you ain't got shit to die for you shouldn't be livin'
get rid the fuckin' smirk ain't a damn thing funny
all my niggas know we live for weed and money
platinum and vogues on the walls of my company
cuz TRU niggas live life motherfuckin' G's
presidents and playin' in every resident
cuz pumpin' no limit shit is essential
I make money off the words that I speak
I flip a cassette like I used to flip a quarter key
the rap game is like standin' on a block
every tape I sell is like a motherfuckin' dime rock
give me the money so you can keep the bitches
they don't play no game C-Murder bout his riches
the money talk and bullshit walks pay to get delt with
and haters get they ass kicked 
Chorus
Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin'
just a bunch of bad motherfuckers just a bunch of thug niggas
Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin'
bunch of bad motherfuckers just a bunch of thug niggas
[Mystikal]
A whole bunch of bad motherfuckers 
ya we bad watch us I ain't playin' with your bitch ass
even if I smoke weed all day drankin' on King Cobra
my eyes red my head bad I still fuck over ya

bitches still the same bigger bank higher rank
whatcha thank your head I like your shit don't stank

???? you mental but you been through

Chorus
[Silkk the Shocker]

fake niggas stand correct show my real niggas some love
Mrs. Thug I live the life of a motherfuckin' thug
7 digits bigger niggas still fightin' in clubs
you think you saw the worst bitch the worst is yet to fuckin' come
up jump and take everyone and your best to fucking run
shoot first ask questions later 
quick before I lose ya ask what time it fuckin' was
i guess when you're too paranoid smokin' too much motherfuckin' bud
don't play no games bitch respect the name bitch
fuck who you came with and fuck what you sayin' bitch
you heard of Mystikal, heard of P, heard of me, and heard of C
either we solo or we ridin' thirty-d you can't stop me I know
all they can do is watch me drop ya with your eyes closed
in a project curb apartment motherfuckin' dealin'
you wanna know why we ain't smilin' cuz we thugs we mugs
ain't nothin' bout being friendly
