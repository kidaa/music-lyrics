Chorus
This be the truest shit I ever said
A nigga might wind up dead
with money comes bad times
these days you got to have a strong mind
I grew up as a motherfucken thug 
An outkast couldn't do shit but slang drugs
In and out of jail ain't no place to be
i'm not short dog but I just want to be free
made a lot of money do dirt pulling capers
don't give a fuck who I hurt 
You wonder why a nigga can't sleep man
because I got the blood of my dead brother on my hand
A true nigga can't rest g 
till these bitch ass get the fuck from around me 
you sweat the tank but your not a real soldier
would you die for this shit ";no"; P I told ya 
your true to the game but your ain't true to me 
nigga be yourself you can't be me or P 
my veins pump no limit blood from day one nigga
ask Big Ed he put it on his only son
chorus 2x
I got a few niggas want me dead 
anticipating my death for the shit I said 
huh true soldiers true niggas 
motherfucking blood true love thugg figues 
bitch niggas be plotting on me 
behind close doors niggas hola when you see me 
P said if you going to get'em 
get'em shoot first and make sure you hit em 
I can't lose another tank dog 
one more dead and watch no limit go off 
y'all ain't ready for war 
I leave niggas tripping off the shit that they saw 
I known for taking niggas out in street murder one 
muthafucker check my rap sheet 
I thank P for taking me out the game 
put the mike in my hand and gave me my name 
Chorus 2x
