Hey C-Murder who you hang with?
Say little Kevin boy you know I only make moves with thugs
nigga nigga nigga what
make moves with thugs, nigga nigga what
I make moves with thugs, ghetto niggas feel me
[C-Murder]
I wake up in the morning and grab my gat
re-cock my shit before I grab my hat
then I page my niggas Fiend and Mac
cuz we be strapped like the men in black
and uhh one time don't bother me 
already payed my dues for a robbery
just cashed a check for 200 G's 
left them hoes alone to pursue my dreams
I told them haters don't play no games
got a bunch of bout it mother fuckers screamin' my name
left the life of crime for the life of ryhme
with every move I make its bulletproofs with nines
you don't wanna go to war with me
I got Big Man and Baz with me
just some more thug niggas ridin' with me
cuz makin' moves with thugs is a high

Chorus2X
You know the deal nigga soliders and thugs

[Master P]
how many niggas wanna ride with me
how many thug niggas and bitches wanna get high with me
