[Nature]
Ay Yo, Ay yo, Regardless of rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales, choking niggas like i'm sprewell
golden state, holding your fate in the palm of my hand
blow you away like its part of the plan
i gotta call it like i see it, talk it like i be it
walkin my walk, thugged out orthopedic
cause i'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up
niggas try to stick me like abdul lerima, follow the leader
make me go extra hard, yo nore should i hold back or show the repirtore
quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers
i show them why its so hard to reach us
i get pussy with my fathers features
puff heavenly, see me at 6'1 quot; weigh a buck 70
catch me in spots yall niggas never be
packed in like green bay
harlem week to queens day
performing acapella, no dj
98 live, no replays
make it seem easy, so tell a friend to tell a friend
that its them again, nature noreaga, wild gremlins

[Big Pun]
Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks
pour on the fort knox lazura
shark salad with cabbage
pork chops and applesauce
twin connection, disrepect watch your body cave in
pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training
i ain't playing, i'm truly the worst
simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed
uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead
i'ma a bubble-head, i never listen to nothing my mother said
ay yo i hold niggas ransom for money
like johhny handsome
been sonning niggas for so long
i think i got a grandson
my passion is money, a stash and a honey
that won't ask questions but will blast anybody
thats my kind of girl, kinda of world i want to live in
not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon
just a little ghetto
where my niggas control the middle
we know the riddles of life where others know only a little

[Cam'ron]
yo, yo been in rich places, sick places
seen my story on 6,666 pages
wages, i wrote six aces
and at the same dice games, i caught six cases
all over big faces, now it's tipped laces
ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't
bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages
cats like to rip places
bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races
but i stay in import the pig places
but the world know the girl though
i fuck her off a furlough
she'll be up, hook me up
all your sales could be luck
only question for these ducks is
baby girl can we fuck
you the type that need a wife
thought L-o-x told yall the key to life
asshole, yo i don't play around
i lay it down
fuck around, i spray around
flick a biscuit, nigga risk it
my ass, you can kick or kiss it

[Jadakiss] Styles
Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this
Bust off and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips
Like 2 thirds of a brick Paniero and 'Kiss
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip
See the plan is to stash all, and cash yall
The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars
Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out
Cuz the rims on my new joint be poking out
I'm about to have no feelings, shit is deep
Do they dance with the devil when they sleep
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit
Shit that they kick in ya ear, 
when your soul be driftin in air
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears
That shit'll drop down my eye,
I'm too tired to cry, 
and I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die
They say you get what you ask for
So get it cuz you asked for it
If a nigga ain't a thief then he better have the cash for it
And we gonna be around til ya body rot
And if the feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got

What! What! What! What!

[Noreaga]
