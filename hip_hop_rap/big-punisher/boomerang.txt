[Big Punisher]
Niggaz is flossin a lot, time to start extortin the plot
Just a portion of prod' off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Somethin for the cops to keep em blind, so we can crime
with piece of mind, turn the key and shine without bein down
Time to expand, New York to Chicago, Colorado
You know my motto, clock G's and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Perignon
We're buyin out the bar, with Don Juan, and every woman's Shawn Dawn-ing
Long donging em down like Shawn Michael does and I'm like a pyscho
fuckin suckin the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister, c'mon on sister
Big Pun's used to cock and squeeze like a gun tester
Crushin sister's backs with the demon snap, hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax, let me feed the cat
Livin fat, true mack, niggaz was catchin feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck it just wasn't as mass appealing
I started feeling funny, niggaz comin short with money
I called my Son he told me chill he'd be over with twenty
Punny what's the deal, niggaz wanna kill me
He said it's real, they jealous and tired of seein me Willie silly
Had more to claim, niggaz throwin shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches runnin the train
It's like a dream, I called my team and started flippin
Lock the clip in started liftin niggaz off the ground like a magician
I skipped town, be back around when things quiet down
I lost the war for now but it'll take more to hold me down

"Top of the world ma!  Ha ha, top of the world!"

[Chorus]
Yo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back
Flashback, livin prosper', eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula, popular to the masses
I miss the E-Classes, riding game with def glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off it's axis
Boomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shine like sterling, then you broke like brick in Berlin

[Big Punisher]
Now should I slit my wrists, go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back, and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record I respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedy's, above the law, fuck em all
I'm coming for the rich thieving em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and beat a prob every source
Of course, I bury any adversary tryin to floss
Just because, the reason I leave em lost in the sauce
Teein off like we up North just for bein soft
A beaten horse like a slave gettin minimum wage
Fillin the gauge, front page, these are the last days
Cash pays, and rules - the root of all evil
Shootin amigos for lootin perrico pollutin our people
Movin kilos like it's all good, through every ghetto
I ain't judgin, but buggin how we floss so many levels
The devil's got us by the balls, that's why the law allows
the drugs to overflood, knowin we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
and priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the bible
Whichever way, you better pay, I'm feelin suicidal

[Chorus]
