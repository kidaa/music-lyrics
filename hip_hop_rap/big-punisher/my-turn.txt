[Big Punisher]
Uhh.. psssh.. it's my turn, y'knahmean
Get this motherfuckin money y'know
Shit..
Yeah I went double, y'know
Niggaz goin triple.. five.. ten platinum
Can't do what I do
This is my game, this is me..
[T. Squaders] Y'know

[Chorus: Big Punisher]

Yo it's my turn, I demand my respect
Give me my burn, or get slammed in your neck
cause it's my turn, I'ma reach to the top
Gimme my burn, I'ma speak with the glock
cause it's my turn, don't make me turn your wig
Gimme my burn, don't make me burn yo' crib
I'ma rhyme it right, and keep the ghetto in a trance
But when the time is right, me and the Devil gon' dance

[Big Punisher]
Fuck you and yours; make way - I'm comin through the door
And screw the law - breakin the rules ain't nothin new at all
I'm true to all the shit that I done, check the clip in my gun
Respect the click that I'm from, or get lifted and stunned
Dunn, you just a small fry, fuckin with the fall guy
Big Pun, The Honorable, all rise
Sky's the limit, nuttin less if my guys is in it
For the right price, even Christ could get it
Fast life we live it - all my memories are vivid
I remember only minutes 
that's how I mentally get rid of all the enemies
The spirits that definitely mimic my every melody
and lyric which so heavenly rhythmic
In magic do I build, but math do be equally compatible
And secretively battle you to reach my peak in equilateral
I'm from the streets deep in the bottom yo ain't no Mario Brothers
Official Bronx niggaz, quick to body yo' mother ouch

[Chorus]

[Big Punisher]
Jesus H. Christ, how many times I gotta pay the price
You scared to death I'll make you twice as afraid of life
I bring sight to the game for every night you complained
you couldn't see the light - I was bright in your brain
Ignitin the flame, keepin your third lid
Speak and observe with the mind 
what are blind sleep til they worth shit
I'm earth wind and fire, the first one to fire
Reppin T. Squad since birth til I retire
I wire your jaw, wire the walls with plastique explosives
and riot the halls at the malls where all the crackers  live
Keep flappin yo' gibs and I'ma come back with those kids
from the back of the bridge
I think two and touch means tackle the bitch
I rap for the chips, but I'm truly assassin
Four hundred pounds, six feet tall, brutally handsome
That's the pro - got beef with Pun, you gots to go
Mafia style - tear you a new ass-a-hole
Flash your dough, but you too cool for the captain
cause I don't give a fuck if I was quadruply platinum
And to the 50 Cent rapper, very funny, get your nut off
Cause in real life, you don't know 
I'll blow your motherfuckin head off ooh yeah

That's my motherfuckin word, you understand
Thought we was a fuckin joke  Shit
Terror Squad nigga, you don't know me
You don't know my name, don't say it, you understand
Told you before I ain't no motherfuckin rapper understand
Shit, I don't make no songs about rappers I don't like
If I'ma make a song, 
it's gon' be how I beat yo' motherfuckin ass understand
That'll be the name of the motherfucker
"That's Why I Had to Beat Your Motherfuckin Ass"
