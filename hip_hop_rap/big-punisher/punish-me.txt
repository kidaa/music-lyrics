feat. Miss Jones

[Big Punisher]
I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than givin birth
My first verse explains some of the game she was playin
I'm blamin myself cause in my wealth was her pain would haven
Behavin like a money hungry hooker, funny how the money took her
from a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminsce how we used to kiss
and smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'
She got too big for her britches but The Britch is Over
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreamin wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fuckin belt
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Shoulda drowned ya when I found ya crushin in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

[Chorus: miss jones]

Come back come back come back come back to meeeee, Punisher
Punish me... ahhhhhhhIII've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back

[Big Punisher]
Nah baby, I'm Not Gon' Be Able to Do It; You blew it
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid -- girl why'd you do it
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends
But 'Roni hurtin all of us for certain by forsakin him
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe
the way you were, preserved, these words so you won't play the herb
ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resistin
I'm insistin you chill for real before you come up missin
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

[Chorus 2X]

[Big Punisher]
I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams
Feathered wings, and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's
Simple dreams a dream fulfilled, the green DeVille Cadillac
to mack, not a fact redeemed to build
I mean for real I can play it mami how you wanna stay
at Monty Frask, givin the next nigga my punani
You want me back cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on
with the Long Don, word bond my shit is strong come back
Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon
and get your hands off my six button Cardigan
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dyin to burn
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect
It's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

[miss jones]
Come back... to, me
I want you to

[Chorus 2X]

to me, yeah yeah
Alright, don't go, no
Ohhhhhahahaooahhoahhohhh, hmmmmmm ohh hmmm hmm
Yeahhhhhhhhh, take my hand, and punish me
Hmm, been so bad, come punish me, yeahh
Take my hand, and punish me, ohhh
Been so bad, come punish me...
