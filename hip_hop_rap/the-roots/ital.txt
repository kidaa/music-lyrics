in all before we fall in the fire

in their minds thus their rhymes are discredited check it out

Verse Two: Black Thought

In my formitive by my peers I was influenced
until the instruments of time killed the congruence
I peeped the blue prints on how to make true sense
of MC's which are a nuisance I know just what to do sinceI'm on another lev.
brothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev.
but they got a lot to learn, to make theri thoughts long term
'cause on theri short-cuts they made a wrong turn
probably, timelessly I construct the firesome
to rip your eardrum for many years to come
professional style thinkin' rational to move wise
so hard it's a wonder y'all alive...

...And still breathin', niggaz is dead and not even
perpetuatin' real life the shit kicked is real trife ayo they fake bleedin'
It's obvious that they needin' attention feedin'
they cold actin' like heathens
when mics is picked up MC's scenes is kicked up
like women with the gripper drinking Moet 'till they hiccup
fellas hustlin' picking bricks up
fantasizin' about the illest stick up
but rip up the jam and we be truly impressed
on stage you won't need your tef. vest
only a mic with and a mic test
and at your best you get blessed by the fans who profess
that they can relate 
with the trials you tribulate
or the pains you endure 
'cause some cats is pure
tell horors that are true but see cats like you
y'all fake joints just tyo get a woo-woo
the tear jerker
you be that miracle worker
whose miracle just ran out
I think it's time you pan out
or just plain fade, 'cause yo you played
we 'bout to drop on you like the Everglades
