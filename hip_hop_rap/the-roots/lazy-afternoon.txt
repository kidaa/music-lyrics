Chorus
------

It's a lazy afternoon
Summertime, as I recline, lay back and relax, let the sun shine

Verse 1
-------

[Black Thought]

Consider this a message to my mellow in the front seat
of the Jeep pumpin' beats for your rump
In the summertime I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20
Ghetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of
I call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I

was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss click> Now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew
sayin' ";Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat
Bring a sack, ayo it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat";
Now it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest
Electric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest
with the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out
as I parlay in my room 'cause it's a lazy afternoon
