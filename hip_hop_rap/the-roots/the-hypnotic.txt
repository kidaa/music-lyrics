Yo,
I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
 And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

I would begin to dial -
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ";Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana";?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it
