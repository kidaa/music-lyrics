                    I been or who I saw or

                    [Verse 1]
                    Black Thought
                    Somebody told me that this planet was small
                    we use to live in the same building on the same floor
                    and never met before
                    until I'm overseas on tour 
                    and peep this ethiopian queen from philly 
                    taking classes abroad
                    she studying film and photo flash focus record
                    said she workin on a flick and
                    could my click do the score
                    she said she loved my show in paris
                    at elise momarre
                    and that I stepped off the stage
                    and took a piece of her heart
                    we knew from the start that
                    things fall apart,and tend to shatter
                    she like that shit don't matter 
                    when I get home get at her
                    through letter, phone, whatever
                    let's link, let's get together
                    shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
                    time passed, we back in philly now she up in my spot
                    tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
                    startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
                    now she in my world like hip-hop 
                    and keep tellin me

                    [Chorus] x2


                    [Verse 2]
                    Black Thought
                    Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin a flight
                    and sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
                    and that's when she flip and get on some 'ol
                    Eve
                    Another lonely night
                    it seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
                    I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
                    but yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
                    while politicing with my sister from new york city
                    she said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty

                    sike, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin 
boo 
                    and when cats be poppin game, I don't hear what they sayin
                    boo
                    when you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
                    with all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
                    so when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
                    and don't be listenin to your homies they be leading you

                    [Chorus] x2

                    [Verse 3]
                    Black Thought
                    That snake could be that chick 
                    and that rat could be that cool cat
                    that's whispering ";she tryin to play you for the fool Black";
                    if something's on your chest then let it be known
                    see I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
                    and on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
                    that people bite back and fracture what's intact
                    and never ever be I ain't on some ";oh I'm a celebrity";
                    I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
                    I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
                    listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
                    that's exactly the point where they whole world ends
                    lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like

                    [Chorus] until fade
