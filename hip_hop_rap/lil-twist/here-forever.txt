Mr Four Ring King Now I'm Swinging In The Outty
I Needs Me a Girl That's Grown So To Ya I Marry
I was Born In 93 By 2 I Was Bad Like Larry

I'm A Beast Can't Get With Me Getting Keys To My Own City

Riding In The QG With No ID
Not Getting Pulled Over Cause The Cops Know T
Jusr Let Me Go Cue [?]
Matter As Fact Escort Like A Fleet
Why Why Cause All The Doors Closing on Me
