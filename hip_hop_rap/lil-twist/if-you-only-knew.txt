Baby I know what your thinking
Asuming that my loves the same as them guys you know
Well baby what if your wrong
And girl you know my feet been aching
Walking on this journey of love and this road just goes on
And Imma hold on, hold on

But baby I know what you want
And with this love we cant go wrong 
Just wake up your love is right here 
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right

And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find

She said I never ever planned on letting go
Matter fact I think I'm ready boo as far as marriage go
I say I know I'm still young but I'm really thinking so shit
All I know was I never gotta this feeling once before
And yo you make me feel different girl when I'm around ya 
First day meeting you I crowned ya
I'm calling too fast trying not to harass
But Imma make sure I'm better than your last 
Put his ass in the past and yeah
