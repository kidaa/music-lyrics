[Khalil]
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, heyyyy, nooooo
I remember when I tried to run 
I didn't get far girl, without your love I
Came back like you knew I would
Go back and change it all girl if I could I
Think about it every time it rings
I don't know why, it just feels the same so
Give me your love, I don't need this pain
Cause girl we both know that ....

[Chorus]
I'll be lost without you 
You know I'll be lost without you 
You, I'll be lost without you 
You know, I'll be lost without you 
You know I'll be lost without you 

[Lil Twist]
Look, I even stalk your twitter sometime, yes
I know I could be bitter sometime
Texting you our zodiac signs
Saying this the sign 
ya girl say I'm sprung cause I only hit it one time
Well oh well, this new ringer fit fine
Been there done that, time to cross the line
Talking marriage after life, name a greater future
Big crib, nice land 
I just don't wanna loose ya
I know I messed up and it wasn't fair
But please forget it kid, pass girl and leave it there
Love vows and we live happily ever after
Planning trips to Cozumel and does that even matter
Tryna GPS our love for this screenshot
I'm tryna climb back to the top, where's the latter 
I don't know what do B, should I add her 

[Chorus]
I'll be lost without you 
You know I'll be lost without you 
You, I'll be lost without you 
You know, I'll be lost without you 
You know I'll be lost without you 
My brother one said 
You know when you lose me 
You lose yourself baby
I'll be lost without you,
You know, I'll be lost without you,
You know, I'll be lost without you

[Khalil]
The sun don't shine when you're away
Tomorrow's never promised for today
The sun don't shine when you're away
Tomorrow's never promised for today

[Piano instrumental until the end of song]
