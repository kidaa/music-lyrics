
Let's try this again
Hawaiian Punch

Unh! The youngest in charge
My pockets been large
A new whip every day, kid
Check my garage

Jeep sittin high and that benz is super-charged
I ain't say they were mines
But look we livin large
Fresh rings, simpson yellow, like I'm rollin Marge.
White package, diamonds singin like young El de Barge

Coming back with the black
I don't how to act
Mister casual flow
But I don't know how to slack
I'm rolling Bugatti and shhh
I don't know how to 'lac
Unless I'm gettin drove around, but look we ordered dat
If I'm in it the escalade, that mean I'm gettin paid
If you knock 3 times or more that mean I'm gettin laid.
Shout out to rosay, free weezy all day
YMCMB, my team on top like toupes

I kill him off, kill him off like first 48
Just give me one of those
If I need two days for drop my gun
When in a store, have my fun, throw em on the floor
Open the door, give me all of that and more
Open your pocket you whore, no sorry if I just swore

But I'm just hungry, no I'm not poor
That's why I came here for
And no not because I needed more

It's my time to shine
But it's bout time to show who I'm is
Twist on every girl wish list
How in the hell could you dish this, unh!

Let, let to be break in

Tired of these dudes fakin
And all these other dudes hatin
When truthfully I'm fly as angel wings
And hotter than Satan

Cool, cool and amazing
All hell is what I'm raising
I'm chill on a vacation
With Jamaican, asian, caucasian,
Cajan, I mean cuban, rick rubin

We cruisin, we winnin, while ya'll losin
Cause we working, When ya'll snoozing
Ch-Checks comin in every week and I tired of movin'
But gettin to the money is somethin' I can't get tired of doin
So I'm gonna keep til I can't
And I ain't gone stop til the bank unlock, mane.

Slow up, slow up, show up, show up here I go
Twizzy F.
Ain't done with the tape, man
Teen rappers, oh wait, is there any left?

Slow up, slow down ya
This how we movin round, and
You didn't like me then, can only imagine you like me now
Twist

These niggas don't want it with us
You see Young Money with us
You should be running with us
Instead of running from us

You see us doin' it big
So you be cuffin yo chick

And every time she speak
You know she's mention lil twist.
