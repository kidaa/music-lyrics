haha yeah, well
I stay turnt up like a stove with a t-kettle
Swag sick like a kid in the hospital

Twizzy F Busta Buss spittin hot riddles
Like a dog off the leash when I say get 'em sic sic em theres another victim
Get into the paper when I baseball hit em
Python bite yeah da boy spit venom uh
What they talkin' about? Like big bros say we walkin 'em out but in my free time I'm learnin how to skate so I'll fuck around and member put the park in the house

Bullseye, nigga yeah the target is out!
Errybody go to red carpet is out so high man I cant come down ahhh

[Chorus:]
Im so turnt up in this bitch
Turnt up in this bitch
Got better house note on my wrist no less than 100k for my whip UH

[Busta Rhymes:]
Twist, lemme get em..
Shuttin every party down is the minimal
Tell the police lookin' for a nigga like a criminal
Ear plugs needed in this mofucka like I got the volume now up way up on the tenth decible
Make a nigga ears bleed till em it is critical niggas think they nice and yeah that shit is kinda typical
Till they be alone, and then they realize they cant fuck with the kid and study my flow and be gettin' analytical
Some will try to do this but you know who the original? Turnt up crazy nigga kinda cynical
I gotta laugh if you niggas only really knew the half to tell the truth you niggas be soundin' pitiful
Real talk hommie I'mma warn you, don't front or I'll sick the little Youngen on ya
Flow venom lil Twist go get em before I have to heat it up like it was sittin' in a sauna, lookin' like a nigga still hustle on tha corner bossed up like a CEO time on her
And if I gotta spittin any longer, somebody gonna probably gonna feel the different kind of torture
When it comes to backin' on a first step, fuck around and be the first to get burnt up
Niggas know that when we in the building yeah we get it TURNT UP!

[Chorus:]
Im so turnt up in this bitch
Turnt up in this bitch
Got better house note on my wrist no less than 100k for my whip UH
Whos fuckin with me?
Ain't a nigga thats fuckin with me
9 chicks got a couple with me, wild girls like driving with me!

Whos fuckin with me?
Whos fuckin with me?
Whos fuckin with me?
Ain't a nigga thats fuckin with me
Whos fuckin with me?
Whos fuckin with me?
Whos fuckin with me?
Ain't a nigga thats fuckin with me NOPE!

[Twist:]

On the words big bro gotta tell me
Mayweather on the nigga on the bell ring
Wont lose if a nigga try to feel me
Gotta betta off chainsaw hill freeze
Bad chick chop some weed up
In the back of the back main back with my feet up
Franklins like urethra shut the whole mall down with a swipe of the Visa!
Shades black cant walk up
Reeds game full of ice lot of cars like Tonka
My swag is awesome, awesome and I run it like Boston
Flashy like Rondeau, got a bash full of bad girls sittin in the condo
Twizzy half the head honcho shoutout CC ablejacks in da londo!
Six swags see the real whip past got the chicks wanna to ride me like Six Flags
G4, G5 switchbacks
Gone in the earliest gone quick, fast!
Tell B roll it up like Nash
While Im in the back countin up this cash
Details swag put a pull up in the slap
Trot wave like I cant handle the clash!

[Chorus:]
Im so turnt up in this bitch
Turnt up in this bitch
Got better house note on my wrist no less than 100k for my whip UH
Whos fuckin with me?
Ain't a nigga thats fuckin with me
