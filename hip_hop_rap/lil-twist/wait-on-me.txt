
Something's fly is hell about you
I'm not leaving here without you
Lot of girls up in this party
But you're looking like somebody that I wanna touch a little bit
Touch a little bit, let the arm tonight
Just kiss a little bit
Touch a little bit, touch a little bit
Oh I've been waiting on you

[Chorus:]
Waiting on you to fall in love, to fall in love
You got my heart and I'm a skip it there, skip it there 1 time time
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you to fall in love
You got my heart and I'm a skip it there
Keep the tale 1 time time
Skip it there, skip it there

No one say making no noise
Girl you're classic like Rolls Royce
Body like a cinafoe, uh baby you gotta know
I don't wanna touch a little bit, touch a little bit
Lay your arm tonight, let's kiss a little bit
Touch a little bit, touch a little bit
Oh I'll be waiting on you

[Chorus:]
Waiting on you to fall in love, to fall in love
You got my heart and I'm a skip it there, skip it there 1 time time
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you to fall in love
You got my heart and I'm a skip it there
Keep the tale 1 time time
Skip it there, skip it there

You're the right one night tryin to do wrong
So once it get you I ain't looking no more
Girl I've been here what took you so long
Well you was on your way yeah with a few hots
I ain't want it girl I was doing all good
I was playing games running in and up the hood
Girl I'm just sayin that I've been patient
Now I'm just waiting waiting waiting on

I've been waiting on you, waiting on you
To fall in love, to fall in love
You got my heart and I'm a skip it there, skip it there 1 time time
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you to fall in love
You got my heart and I'm a skip it there
Keep the tale 1 time time
Skip it there, skip it there

I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you you you you you you
