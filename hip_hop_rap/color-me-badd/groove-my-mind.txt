Girl, it seems like only yesterday
That I fell in love with you
And girl, I'd really like to say
That it's a pleasure knowing you
I just can't explain the way I feel
When tender words leave your lips
And every moment that you are here with me
I'm so happy my heart skips a beat
Chorus
I love the way you groove my mind
I like the way you make me feel
I love the way you groove my mind
Honey, when we make love I feel so real
Since I first began to trust
You were there long before me
Sharing all all your love and trust
But when I ask myself How long can this be
Someone as beautiful as you
Who can give me love so true
I don't but I feel it through and through
So baby don't stop doin' what you do
Chorus
You know it seems like only yesterday that I fell in love with you
And I really have to say it's been a pleasure
See I know this time it's special
I love the way you groove my mind
Oh I ain't no Casanova
But honey I need your love every day
And hey, I just want to get next to you
So let's get it on
Let's get it on and on
I love the way you groove way you groove
I love the way you groove way you groove
Way you groove me
I love the way you groove way you groove
I love the way you groove
