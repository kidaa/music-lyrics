Freaky, funky, dope,

Wait a minute stop,Give a little props
Marleys on the board watch him rise to the top
He's on the wheel and winning
Got a funky feeling
Take it, take it, or leave it
Ohh to the hell with you
Dont front on the funk, in my trunk
Let go no joke
Let us work 
Color me badd ain't no joke
Diggetty dope, remix bag of tricks
Trick or treat smell my feet
