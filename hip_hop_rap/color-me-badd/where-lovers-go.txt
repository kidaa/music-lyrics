Asian Bonus Track
I have a plan, a woman and a man
against the wind but living free
the price for love my life for thee
don't run in fear, I need you to be here
I will climb the walls you hide behind
I will search the world until I find
I know that the ride we take
a life we'll make above the fears, beyond the tears
happiness remains through the years
I can be the one, you know I can
when you're following me home, your heart in hand
helplessly controlled to another land
to a place where lovers go
I see the light, endless in your eyes
shining through, calling me, I forget the hurtful memories
dodging the stars, to get where they are
they fought until they made it through
I will fight the same to arrive with you
repeat
a companion and a friend, I will love you til the end
til the end of time, through the years
repeat
