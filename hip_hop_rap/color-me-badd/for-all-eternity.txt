Many a night I lie alone
Inside a room that's not of my own
Having no one to hold onto
whod understand what I am going through.
So I at night, lay down a plan
to occupy myself to make me a better man.
Thats the only way I get through the night.
So I dont turn off the lights....
Chorus
And I wait for all eternity
for someone who will comfort me,
and as time passes
I get vivid flashes of you running through my mind. oh yeah
Many a morning sun appears
wake up and find on my face a tear
Coz from the vivid dream in my head,
of you in arms, but its my pillow instead.
So real did it feel way our bodies met.
The softness of your hands, your lips, on my neck.
God I wish you were here.
My desire is sincere
I need you near.
But I guess I must wait,
For all eternity
For someone who will comfort me.
and as time passes,
I get vivid flashes of you run-in through my mind.
Where? Where are you?
I need to know oh I need to know
I searched high and low.
I need you so.
But I guess I must wait.....
Repeat Chorus
Ill follow you
Ill follow you.
Where ever you go.
I get lonely sometimes lonely, lonely......
I m goin be right here.
right here.
Here all by myself.
