Girl, Ive had some good,
Ive had some bad in my days.
I never knew someone like you would come my way.
To tell the truth, I cant help but be a little afraid
I think your love might be a little too much for me.
Chorus
Now we can get sexual
Girl, I wanna be down everyday and night sugar
Now we can get sexual
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
Now we can get sexual
Im die-n- Im tryin- I wanna Im die-n- Im tryin-ooh.....
Im afraid that your lovin might just be a little too much for me.
Afraid, might be, too much
....girl

Ive seen them beg, I made them plead for more
But Ive never seen nothing better babe,
I am a little afraid I think your love might be-a little too much for me.

Repeat Chorus
Girl your love might be-a little too much for me. a little to much
Girl your love might be, sexual capacity a little too much
Girl your love might be-a little too much for me. a little too much
Girl your love might be- a little too much-a little too much for me. Yeah!
I wanna- I wanna be down
I wanna- I wanna be down
I wanna- I wanna be down
I wanna- I wanna be down
Repeat Chorus

Theres just somethin I wanna say to you, baby I wanna be down...
