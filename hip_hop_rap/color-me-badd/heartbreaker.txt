Girl.....
Yo, why you wanna play me like that?
Girl, every time I see you
Youre with a different man
You tellem that you love em
And then take every thing you can
Youre living life in the fast lane
Youre no longer Daddys girl
Cant stay with just one man 
You gotta love them all around the world
Ive got my eye on you 
And I know just what you are
Youre just a using girl
You drive me like a car
Chorus
Youre a money taker and a heartbreaker
Youll never find yourself a true love to hold
Youre a money taker and a heartbreaker
Baby...your hearts just too cold
Girl...
Time keeps tickin by you 
So you better make up your mind
Are you gonna let somebody love you
For more than just one night
You get everything you ask for
So you have no need to steal
Wed all be dead right now
If pretty looks could kill
Chorus
Girl, I know your fly but tell me why
Must you even try to take what I have earned
Just wait your turn, from what I see 
you got a lot to learn about life, being a wife or
Even just being my girl
Is false hype so word, change you attitude
You gotta learn to show some gratitude
Yeah, Im on your trip but girl dont flip
Coz Im hip to the way you trip so just skip
All the fun and games, I know youre a faker
Yo tell em what she is....a money taker!
Chorus
Yo, the B is not a fool so what do you take me for
You think youre gettin over, well take a look at the score
Yo 1,2,3, yep youre outta here, I, letting you go
Savin the rest of my tears, for someone who will
Treat me right like I should be, not tryin to break my heart
Nor take my money, just like you drove me 
Then you been driven, so get out of my life 
And get into the hard livin
Chorus
