Girl iv'e been waiting
For oh so long now
Just for this moment
When no ones around you
Just close your eyes
Let me feel your breath against mine
C'mon now it's time
Chorus
OOh sweet love,i,m kissing you
OOh my love, kissing you,kissing you
Lets wait for the chance girl
That we can escape
Sneak out the back door baby
Ain't never too late
So we can be alone just for a while
Coz a while is all i need
Chorus
Ooh baby, what's it gonna be
You think you wanna roll wit' me
I'll make you say....
Ooh suga the mood is right
And my game is tight,c'mon
Chorus
