You never know
Its hard to say sometimes, where a love will lead
Its a mystery, you take a chance
Its in the hands of faith, If well make it sugar
Time alone will show us what will be
Until were sure about it,
We dont want to rush into anything baby
Chorus
Why dont we just start with forever
and take it from there
If you got the time, baby Ive got a lifetime to share
Why don't we spend some time together
Lets start with forever.
I understand...
I understand that you dont know me well
and if its meant to be, only time will tell
I only know that when Im in your arms  I know
I wanna stay there always
I would like to spend my life with you
If your not sure about it love, love, love...
we dont have to rush into anything baby
Chorus
Ohh, Its gonna take at least a lifetime
to know whats gonna be know whats gonna be 
So why dont you spend a lifetime with me
I believe that we can make it together, I feel no doubt
Lets spend forever just finding out just finding out
Time alone will show us what well be
If your not sure about it love, love, love....
We dont have to rush into anything baby
Why don't we just start with forever, and take it from there 
If youve got the time, baby Ive got a lifetime to share
Start with forever, whoa start with forever 
Let's start with tonight
