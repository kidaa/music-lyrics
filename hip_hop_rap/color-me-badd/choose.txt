You know Im not much on words 
but I got to tell you how I feel.
Open your eyes, dont try to hide my love
So hard to say but I think its best
Gotta give your heart time to heal, and
When your ready, Ill be there
Chorus
Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do 
what I dont want to do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die you choose.
Im serious when I tell you, love
that a little heartbreak
Is ten to a dime
Dont be afraid  are you with me baby?
Just turn the page my love
Curious when the day will come
I see my reflection in your eyes
Take your time and Ill be there
Chorus
Sometimes I try and sometime a sometime
Sometimes I cry ohh
Only love will make me do
what I dont want to do.
Anything you want me to anything, anything
I will live or die - you choose  I will live or die for you ohh...
Spoken
Looking through my eyes at the world
Cant you see
Every time I see your face
Theres a choice to be made.
Walking hand in hand
Through the sands of time
As I peer into the past 
Foreign steps are terrorizing
Watching what is now
Theres a fork in the path
Of the future of your life
Which road shall you choose?
Choices to be made
Past and present
Its not easy
But my love wont let me die Should
until your heart resurrects me
Chorus
