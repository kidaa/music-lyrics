You have turned into a prayer
I can feel Im almost there
Closer, closer to the top
Lookin down is quite a drop
Chorus:
Let me have it all
Hold no grudge from yesterday
It got up and flew away
Want my cake and eat it too
Cant wait to stick my fork in you
Make me feel just like a king
Everything is everything
Chorus
You have turned into a prayer
I can feel Im almost there
You set up a barrier
Dont ya know Ill marry you
just to be near you is to be
Let me have the rest of me
Closer, closer to the top
Lookin down is quite a drop
Chorus
