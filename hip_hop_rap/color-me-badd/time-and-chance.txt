Chorus
Don't it hurt so bad... Time..
And it hurt so bad... Chance..
Tryin to find the faith before the fall
Good mans down, while a bad mans standin tall
Strongest one dont always win them all
Going crazy, going crazy
Time and Chance
Chorus oh chance and time
The way they do my life is going round
Never straight up, sideways, upside down
Brothers livin six feet underground
Oh got me crazy, Im so crazy
ohh...Time and Chance
Chorus
So bad.. so, so bad
A poor man lives in happiness
A millionaire evil as he wanna be
A good man going hungry....
Cause of Time and Chance
Chorus Dont it hurt
Im tryin to find the faith before the fall
A good mans down, while a bad mans standing tall
A strong man don't always, win em all
Im going crazy, crazy, crazy, baby!
Don't it hurt so bad? Oh it really hurt so bad
And it hurt so bad, Tell me can you feel the pain?
Dont it hurt so bad Time and Chance
And it hurt so bad So bad, so, so, bad
It really hurt so bad, no one can stand the pain, Now is all about Time and Chance
Time and Chance......Dont it hurt so bad
So bad, so bad
Dont hurt so bad
And it hurt so bad......
