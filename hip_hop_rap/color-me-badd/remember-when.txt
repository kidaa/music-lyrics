Nothing could be harder to believe
When you told me that you needed to be free
I'm only getting by on memories
Hoping maybe time will help you see
Chorus
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind
I've got nothing to lose, nothing to hide
Can't live without you, i'm dying inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when
I'm searching for the one abandoned dream
I need to reclaim
Heaven's in the love
I cannot reach, can't reach
You know, i'm longing for the magic of your touch
And i thank god
I've never given up the chance to trust
You'd come back to me baby
Chorus
I know i'll be holding on to thoughts of yesterday
And this silence could fade away
I keep holding on to the times we shared baby
You know i'll never,never let you go let you go
Chorus
