You're the one I wanna love
Can't live without your love
I'll always want you with me

Lady for you I'll do
Anything you want me to I'll do
Chorus
You're the one I wanna love yeah- e yeah- e
You're the one I wanna love yeah- e yeah- e -yeah-e-yeah-e

When we're apart I could die to be with you again
That's how I care about you pretty baby, oh
Chorus
You're the one I wanna love yeah- e yeah- e
You're the one I wanna love yeah- e yeah- e- yeah- e yeah- e
RAP
Talkin' about the girl over there,she looks good
It's understood that she's a little on the wild side
I'd like to take away that fancy dress and look inside
If you know what I mean, call me obscene
If you wish, she's a dish and I'm not playin' cat and mouse
Let her come over to my house..
And I'll keep that booty swayin'!
