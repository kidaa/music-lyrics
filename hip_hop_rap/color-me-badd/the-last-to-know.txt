Oh, yeah baby,
Where does love go when you're not in love?
How does it feel when nobody want's it.
Tell me does it float around
Like a little lost cloud?
When a heart is not its home.
What does love do, when it's not being used?
Feeling like you just dont get enough home.
Is it laying awake in the middle of the night,
Thinking about what went wrong?
Cause when I look in your eyes it's just not there
And when I hunger for affection
The cupboard is bare.
I don't know why I keep hangin' on
When love's got the message,
Then it's already gone.
Chorus
Why am I always the last to know?
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over?
Why am I always the last to see
Just a fool who believes
You're still in love with me
Even love can see it's over
Always the last to know, oh yeah baby
What do I do till I'm back on my feet?
Do I hang around and try to pretend,
That I'm really over you and it won't be long
Till love says it's my turn again
Cause when I look in your eyes it's just not there
And when I hunger for affection
The cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hangin' on
When love's got the message
And it's already gone.
Repeat Chorus
Oh The next time I fall next time I fall
Ill be takein my time
Till I know, Her love is mine
