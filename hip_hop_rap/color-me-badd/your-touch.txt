Love was whispering my fate
I heard it through your smile
And now i get through every day baby
Just to hold you at night
There is no star out of my reach
And forever's not to long
Nothing is impossible baby
When i'm with you, when i'm with you
Chorus
I can finally believe now without my pride
When i'm reachin' out to love from inside
And i could never be afraid with the comfort of
Your touch
A thousand worries fade away
In the sweetness of your kiss
And all the walls come fallin' down
Cause your love is everything,everything to me
