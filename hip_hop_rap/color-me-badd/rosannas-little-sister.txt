Rosanna's little sister
Watched me as I kissed her
Older sister's lips
With a passion that always missed her
It was dark outside my window
But I could see her from the light
She was standing perfectly naked
Turning up the heat of the night
In the heat of the night
No matter how I try she's there
I just can't get her out of my mind
I can't hide
Chorus
No I can't resist your little sister
Every day and every night I fear
Another twist of a knife
'Cause I know it ain't right
I couldn't stop to think about
In my mind there was no doubt
I slipped my arms away
From my baby as she lay asleep
I made sure she didn't wake
No matter how I try she's there
I just can't get her out of my mind
I can't hide
Chorus
Noisy floorboards, creakin' doors
I finally made it down the corridor
To the room I'd never seen all
But dreamt of a thousand times before
I wanted to get inside her head
Under the covers inside the bed
I looked around and turned to see
Rosanna lookin' up at me
No I can't resist your little sister
Every day and every night I feel
Another twist of a knife
'Cause I know it ain't right
