While I am holding you so near. holding you so near

those three little words,
That thrill the heart of me. thrill the heart of me
Just whisper I love you until eternally

This lonely heart of mine,
seems to need you so much more.
The touch of your lips,
the thrill of your embrace. thrill of your embrace
Keeps saying that no one would ever take your place.

I wish upon a star.
I pray for a blessing from above.
