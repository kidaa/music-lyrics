Girl i can't believe,Not in my wildest dreams
That you would do this to me
Thats why i'm standing here
Baptized in all my tears
How could you break my heart so easily
I gotta let you know
Thats not the way i flow
This thing is blowin' my mind
After all that we been through
How could you do what you do baby be so unkind
Chorus
How could this be
That you would just up and go away from me
How could you go
You got me feelin' like i'm kind of all alone
How could this be
That you would just up and go away from me
How could this be
You cannot tell me you did'nt know
I loved you so
How could this......
Ithought that we were both
Seeing eye to eye
How could you tell me that lie
That you were down for me
Like i was down for you
How could you be so untrue
I'm tryin' to figure out
What were you thinkin' 'bout
When you just walked out my life
Coz every day i still wonder
Would you be my wife so tell me....
Chorus
Coz girl i'm in a bad situation
So tell me what am i supposed to do
I don't have a clue what i'm facin'
I'm still in love with you
And every day i'm not with you
My heart is slowly breakin'
I don't wanna be right
When you always do me wrong
So why am i singin' this song
Chorus
