Nothing could be harder to believe
To feel my world just fade away from me
I pray that maybe time will help me see... see
Holding on with loving memories..... sweet memories
Chorus
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind
I've got nothing to lose, nothing to hide
I`ll cherish these memories to help me survive
Can't we get it back again
Remember when
I'm searching for that unforgotten who
I know what it seems
The day that you can wrap me in your wings
we`ll fly..  we`ll fly.... we`ll fly
You know, i'm longing for the magic of your touch
And i thank god
I've never given up the chance to trust
I`ll hold you again baby
Chorus
I know i'll be holding on to thoughts of yesterday
And this silence could fade away
I keep holding on to the times we shared baby
You know i'll never,never let you go let you go
Chorus
