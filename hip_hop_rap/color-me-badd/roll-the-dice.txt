It's not about another love affair
I'm looking for that special girl to share
I'm ready not to make a deal
I wanna love that's more than real
Girl you hold the winning card for you I'd gamble all my heart
I'm going for broke girl
You've got that lucky stroke
You hold our love in the palm of your hand
Chorus
Roll the dice
Don't think twice
Let's get together
And melt the ice
Let's take a chance
Let's explore romance
We'll be rolling double 7
Straight into heaven
I wanna show you how good love can be
You'll never lose it if you stick with me
I'm spinning now in your direction
Betting all your affection
Girl, don't you be afraid
Hold onto me and you'll be safe
coz lady luck is smiling on us
So let it ride, I promise we won't bust
Chorus
Roll the dice
Don't think twice
Let's get together
And melt the ice
Let's take a chance
Let's explore romance
We'll be rolling double 7
Straight into heaven
I'm going for broke girl
You've got that lucky stroke
You hold our love in the palm of your hand
