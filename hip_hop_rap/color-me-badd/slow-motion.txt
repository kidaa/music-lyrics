Ooh sock it to me mama
Oh I thought I saw a pussy cat baby all right
Ya she looks like she can be my personal steady,
Ya, let me make this move.
Baby I want cha very bad babe I do
And I've been wanting you for so long, oh
And I could never love you fast babe not you
I take my time and love you all night long
All night, Yeah,
You know that I want your love
Let me make it right, For you...
All night, You're the one I'm thinking of
Once I make it right
Baby I know you will never go talk to me mama
Slow..
Chorus
I like to love you in slow motion
Ooh ya got it goin on slow
Let me love you slow, slow
I like to love you slow so morning will come before I do
Let me love you, slow slow motion is better then no motion, baby
Ah, come on
My motor is round
You got this animal hype in ya

To get my timing right
Baby I think you're very sexy sing the song, sing the song I do
Come over here and get a little bit closer to me, yeah
The time has come for me to love you real slow, slow
Motion lover is what they call me! good God!

and bonk the rest. yeah!
You all just as crazy as joy!
