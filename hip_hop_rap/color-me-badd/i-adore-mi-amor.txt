You want to take her place
You say you'd treat me better
But, better I know for sure
You see she loves me
And I could never leave her ooh yeah
Never baby, never
She means the world to me
And I live for her
Chica tu cres me vida la ternuda
She's my destiny I know
Y alegria amor
Forever my love
Y est sueno
And I'll never let her go oh no
Contigo sera verda yeah yeah
Dream on... Dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever
Chorus
I adore... mi amor
I adore... mi amor
Listen... my love, the girl of my dreams
And I will never leave
She's all that I need and more
I'll love her always
What more could a man ask for
What more could I ask for
You know that I really love my baby
She can give me everything I need
There is no one to take her place
She's got my heart in her hands
Baby, I adore
Dream on... dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever
