I never really thought that this could happen
Me fallin' in love with you girl
We were always good friends
Now how do we ever start explaining
Coz being my best friend
I know he would'nt understand
Now how did we get this far
Coz i remember all the things my mother said
Chorus
What's in the dark
Must come to the light
You know we can't go on
Livin' a lie
We can hide the truth and make believe
For only so long
Before they discover
That we're secret lovers
Now tell me what we do about our situation
Coz it's only fair that they both know what's going on
Now tell me what we do about our obligations
Before we both destroy our happy homes
Now how did we let it get this far
Girl i don't know but love has taken control
Chorus
You know we can't go on
You know we can't let it go
Although we've gotta try
Although faith ain't on our side
You know i'm feelin' inside
We can no longer disguise
We know they're gonna find out
We know without a doubt
The word is gonna get out
Chorus
