1,2,3,4 Ooh.....
Brother can you see?
Brother do you see the children dying?
Brother do you try and understand?
All of the horrors behind the crying
Why do we do these things to each other?
Do thy see and do offer help? 
The more I know
Weve got to understand
Brother I fear we got to let love rule....
Sister can you see?
Sister do you see the children dying?
Sister do you try and understand?
All of the horrors behind the crying
Why do we do these things to each other?
Do thy see and to offer help 
The more I know
Weve go to understand 
Sister, I fear
Weve got to let love rule
