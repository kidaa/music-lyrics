I see the time hands
They're tickin' by me every day
Fallin' in love
While I feel your love slippin' away
But if you should fall
I'll be there to catch you
In 40 years I could never miss you
Baby I'll be there for you
But first you got to let me know
Chorus
How deep is your love
Are you willin' to go
Every extra mile to show
That you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love
With you baby doll
You are my savior
Got me through my deepest darkness girl
And I still love you
But I feel your love is leavin' my world
Don't you remember
You use to hold me
When you said you'd never leave me
It doesn't feel the same anymore
So baby please just let me know
Chorus Repeat
