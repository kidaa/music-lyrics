I knew you were the perfect girl
For my love
For you I thank the stars in the
Heaven above
Love of my life
Time was on our side
It took you quite a while to hold my hand
I was patient baby
It was all in the plan
Oh sweet love is blind
I showered you with kisses and flowers
Held you through the days and the midnight hours
Did it all because that I wanted
To open your heart and make
Chorus
You trust me
The meaning in my life a sunny day
I need you as a light to show me the way
You're a vision of love
Or baby didn't you know
This love is gonna last
Until the end
You're never gonna have to
Be alone again
I'll never let you go
Chorus
Just a little more time
Girl I know you'll be mine
Just a little more
Just a little
And with a little more love
Girl I know that it's just
Just a matter of trust
Girl if you really want me
I really want to be
Right there by your side or eternity
And if you really wanna know
I'll never let you go my baby baby
I only want you to trust me
