Shes faced the hardest times you could imagine.
And many times her eyes fought back the tears.
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders,
bore the weight of all her fears.
And the sorrow no one hears,
Still rings in midnight silence
In her ears...
Chorus
Let her cry, for shes a lady shes a lady
Let her dream, for shes a child child
Let the rain fall down upon her
Shes a free and gentle flower, growing wild
And if by chance that I should hold her, And if by chance that I should hold her
let me hold her for a time let me hold her for a time
And if allowed but one possession,
I will pick her from the garden to be mine. I will pick her from the garden to be mine
Mine....
Be careful how you touch her, for shell awaken
And sleeps the only freedom that she knows  That she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you wont believe
The way shes always payin,
For a debt she never owes
And the silent wind still blows, That only she can hear,
And so she goes....
Repeat Chorus twice
Shes a flower...
Growing Wild.......
