I did my best 
But I guess my best wasn't good enough 
`Cause here we are back where we were before. 
Seems nothing ever changes-- 
We're back to being strangers 
Wondering if we ought to stay or head on out the door. 

Just once, can we figure out 
What we keep doing wrong, 
Why we never last for very wrong, 
What are we doing wrong? 
Just once, can't we find a way to finally make it right, 
To make the magic last for more than just one night. 
If we could just get to it, 
I know we could break through it. 

I gave my all 
But I think my all may have been too much 
`Cause Lord knows , we're not getting anywhere. 
Seems we're always blowing 
Whatever we've got going' 
And it seems at times with all we've got 
We haven't got a prayer.

Just once, can we figure out 
What we keep doing wrong, 
Why the good times never last for long, 
Where are we going wrong? 
Just once, can't we find a way to finally make it right, 
To make the magic last for more than just one night. 
I know we could break through it. 
If we could just get to it, just once 

I want to understand 
Why it always comes back to goodbye. 
Why can't we get ourselves in hand 
And admit to one another 
We're no good without each other? 
Take the best and make it better, 
Find a way to stay together.

Just once, can't we find a way to finally make it right, 
To make the magic last for more than just one night. 
I know we could break through it. 
If we could just get to it, just once 
We could get to it, just once
