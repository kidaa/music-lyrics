We were so close together
Like being born again
Now everything is withered
My dream is gone

Farewell, my loveI will no longer hide
This constant fear inside
I will no longer hide
This constant pain inside
Whispers from below
Darkness fills my eyes
My dream is forsaken
A victim of your demise

I thought we were close together
How could I be so naive
Now everything is withered
I vanish in grief
