Behind the other side
Crossing the border to Neverland, I am lost
Behind, behind the other side
Inescapable, inexcusable
I am lost behind

Went through the deepest rivers
Climbed the highest mountains
Swore to be faithful, the most faithful
Succumbed the ancient spirit
And stranded in eternity

Let the wind carry me above
Let the stars show me the way
Let the moon protect me

Hiding in the shadows
Afraid to see the light
My pale reflections
Finally out of sightIntegration, condemned to be
Without communication
Let my body into nothingness

Now I lie here restless
I can only I'd been thinking
Oh, God, take my soul away

My thoughts are in circles
Only one thing on my mind
I could have made it happen
I scream and say goodbye
