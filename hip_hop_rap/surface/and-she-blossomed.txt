The lighting tears of she who arose
From the glow of the sunset
An auricular confession
Where her colossal lust is forged

Into a blazingspark
A spark which soon sets
Free her ardent genitals

As soft as velvet
As sweet as honey
As beautyful as the virginal scent of herHer scarlet abdornen
Finer than silk
A vestige of heaven
Her ardent genitals invite me in

On the confessional
Thenectar of our orgasm
Runs down her tights
Covering the face of Christ - Jesus Christ
