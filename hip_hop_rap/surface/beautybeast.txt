Like rings in the water
Lethargic drifting apart
Never reaching shore
Longingforever more

Unperceived our crimson beauty
Lurks into a vehement chasm
The tide reveals the beast

The beautybeast - is haunting me
The beautybeast - takes control
The beautybeast - is haunting me
The beautybeast - takes my soul

Beauty, the beautybeastFrantic as my heroine
Secludes her sinister deeds
Platacatory she avoids
What now is her deceit

I raise my fist to the sky
And swear my hunger for revenge will never die

My faith in you is decerpit
Never will I repress your defamatory deceit

Like leaves in autumn trees
Lethargic drifting apart
Withering, soon sour
Longing forever more
