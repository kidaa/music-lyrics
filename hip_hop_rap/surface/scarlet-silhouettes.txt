Fitful, demonical, subdued

Rising of Lucifer's wave
A silently passing of emotional replacement

Lounging down the avenue of piquant
Furiosly applying our amorous glances

The searchlight of the pistil
Compatible with my loving she hound

Hounds of love we were
Blood hounds in season
True we never were
Broken vow of charityScarlet, scarlet, scarlet silhouettes
Lying in her silk sheets covered in sweat

Scarlet, scarlet, scarlet silhouettes
An exhibition of luck, I slowly regret

Scarlet, scarlet, scarlet silhouettes
As my prime fills her camisole I wish we never met

Seeing into the eyes of the bewitched
All left are the scars it made
