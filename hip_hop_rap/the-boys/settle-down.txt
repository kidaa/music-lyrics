Brimming with useless information,
Spilling thoughts void of true opinion,
Yet you'll fight it to the death,
You'll fight it to the death.

Fighting someone else's favour,
You'll regurgitate the words you heard on,
Radio two... Oh didn't you?

Stop throwing insults and crockery around,
We can all be constructive,
So settle down, settle down.

Oh, have your dire of needs a certain suitor,
What is open-minded to calmly digest the very question and...
And understand.

To look at things from many angles,
Construct and critique, without anger,
Even compromise... you'll never compromise.

Stop throwing insults and crockery around,
We can all be constructive,
So settle down, settle down.

Stop throwing insults and crockery around,
We can all be constructive,
So settle down, settle down.

Stop throwing insults and crockery around.

Stop throwing insults and crockery around,
We can all be constructive,
So settle down, settle down.

Stop throwing insults and crockery around,
We can all be constructive,
So settle down, settle down,
Settle down, settle down.
