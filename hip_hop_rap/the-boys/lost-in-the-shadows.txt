The Lost Boys

Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
No one knows

I can't wait, I can't wait, no
When I see little lights in the shadows
One must hide when the sun gets higher
I don't know what this madness means

Here comes the night
The bedroom in shadows
Candlelights
I don't know where it's coming from
But I, I keep moving on
Till the darkest thought makes me want to try these wings

Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
No one knows

Loneliness pours over you
Emptiness can pull you through
Did you go to sleep with the light on?
I can't wait for this feeling to free me

Wind blows hard, but it doesn't matter
'Cause when the sun goes down
Nothing else matters
The line is where the night lies
I will wait outside her window tonight

Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
No one knows

Loneliness pours over you
Emptiness can pull you through
Did you go to sleep with the light on?
I can't wait for this feeling to free me

Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
No one knows
