La la la... 
I wake up late every morning 
managers calling I'm still yawning 
Get up wake up hair and makeups 
Waiting for you don't be sawing 
This performance is important 
I don't think I can put my all in 
Hold on i was drunk last night 
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right 
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type 
Now my phones on silent im being polite 
Now private numbers get no love from me 
Just let me be 

[chorus] 
Oh my gosh my days are getting longer 
And there's no turning back, im working a 9 to 5 
Just to keep my contract did I say I meant 1:30 
Im no early birdy I'm working a 9 to 5 

la la la... 

So you gottado sum ite for channel u 
Channel who sorry who im altered for snooze 
Oh! Channel U da ones dat made me huge 
Like Katie Prices boobs 
Whoops I'm being rude 
Wheres my red bull and my sandwich i need food 
I cant handle this 
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum 
Action 

[chorus] 
Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer 
And theres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5 
Just to keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30 
Im no early birdy I'm working a 9 to 5 

la la la... 
la la la... 

I'm not sure what day just started 
Since my working week departed 
Ever since I single charted 
This persuits be ever lasted 
I clocked in about a year ago 
And I haven't clocked out from the studio 
And videos and tv shows 
And staring at the window on the road 
And though sometimes we don't get paid for these round pages on the stages 
I know that I won't get jaded 
I won't go back to the minimum wages 

[chorus] 
Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer 
And theres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5 
Just to keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30 
Im no early birdy I'm working a 9 to 5 

la la la... 

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer 
And theres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5 
Just to keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30 
Im no early birdy I'm working a 9 to 5 

la la la...
