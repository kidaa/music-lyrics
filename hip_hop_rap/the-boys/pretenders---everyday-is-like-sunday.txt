Thanks to Julia James for submitting       
the lyrics

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon ! 
Everyday is Like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly wish I was not here"
In the seaside town
...they forgot to bomb !
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb !
Everyday is Like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win yourself a Cheap Tray"
Share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey
