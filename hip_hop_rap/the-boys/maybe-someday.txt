One, two, three, four!

Why should, you leave your home,
Oh, when the TV's on,
Oh, when I was half joking,
But I know that you'll be fine,
Who needs love when you got two eyes and you got the time?

Waiting for some inspiration, but lack the human interaction.

Cursing, your computer,
Because it will not do,
A single thing that you're sure it ought to,
With your so called friends you love,
As an a.k.a of a pseudonym that you wish you were.

Waiting for some inspiration, but lack the human interaction,
Oh, waiting for some inspiration, but lack the human interaction.

Oh, waiting for some inspiration, but lack the human interaction,
Oh, waiting for some inspiration, but lack the human interaction.
