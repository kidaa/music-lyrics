I weave with brightly colored strings
to keep my mind off other things;
So, ladies, let your fingers dance
and keep your hands out of romance.

Lovely witches
let the stitches
keep your fingers under control.

Cut the tread but leave
the whole heart whole.
Marry maids can sew and sleep;
wives can only sew and weep!

Falling in love with love is falling for make believe.
Falling in love with love is playing the fool;
Caring too much in such a juvenile fancy.
Learning to trust is just for children in school.

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see.
I fell in love with love, With love everlasting,
But love fell out with me.
