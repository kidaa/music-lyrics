You barged into this a lie 
And now you're far too deep to...stop, 
When your eyes were full of fire 
And you didn't feel tense 

When you lie to one another 
It's that there's nothing left to say, 
The words 'I Love You' fill awkward silences 

And life just cannot...STOP! 
If you've gone and messed it...up, 
And I won't be here, no I won't comfort you 
So get your act together 

Your matrimonial fulfillment started life as harmless lies, 
Thanks to bodily requirements 
You are walking blind 

And life just cannot...STOP! 
If you've gone and messed it up 
And I won't be here, no I won't comfort you 
Oh get your act together 

And life just cannot... 
And life just cannot... 
And life just cannot... 
STOP!
