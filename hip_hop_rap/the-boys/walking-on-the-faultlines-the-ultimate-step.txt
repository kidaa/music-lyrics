It was obvious, but I just couldn't see it 
How to stay on the playlist, stay edgeless and pretty 
How to avoid the red marks, that are so carelessly damning 
To shake off the truth and retain the glamour 

Have you heard all the stars that are relentlessly living? 
You care that the world can be so unforgiving 
It's so desperately easy to fall out of orbit 
Now I'm all but out and it's so certainly for it 

There's only one more step I know 
Maybe it could be avoided but I don't think so 
I guess I'm ready...here we go 

I've been walking on the faultlines 
I've been taking the dark route home 
I've been dancing on the landmines 
There's nowhere else to go 

In the end will be my beginning 
To get on the A-list I'll just quitt when I'm winning 
To forgive not forget, to repent not regret 
And to close my eyes would be my bravest move yet 

And I wake up and it's my finest hour 
Then the party ends and the sweetness turns sour 
It's so desperately easy for me to employ it 
The only catch is I'm not here to enjoy it 

There's only one more step I know 
Maybe it could be avoided but I don't think so 
I guess I'm ready...here we go 

I've been walking on the faultlines 
I've been taking the dark route home 
I've been dancing on the landmines 
There is nowhere else to go 

Whoo-whey, whoo-whey, whoo whoo 

There's only one more step I know 
I guess I'm ready...here we go 

I've been walking on the faultlines 
I've been taking the dark route home 
I've been dancing on the landmines 
There is nowhere else to go 

I've been getting drunk and playing with matches 
Listening to the radio in the bath 
I've been crossing main roads with my eyes closed 
With my name in lights or my name in stone
