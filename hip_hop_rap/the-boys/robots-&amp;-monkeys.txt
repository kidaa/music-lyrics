Where have they gone?
Where have they gone?
All the days when we didn't know right from wrong, oh no.
And know we're so grown up just like we wanted to be,
Building up debts, I wont be, I wont be.

What do you wanna be,
A robot or a monkey?
What do you wanna be,
A robot or a monkey?

What can you do?
What can you do
When money has a way of catching up with you? Yeh yeh.
So you work all day and you sleep all night,
Then you work all day, it's not right, it's not right!

What do you wanna be,
A robot or a monkey?
What do you wanna be,
A robot or a monkey? Yeh yeh yeh!
What do you wanna be,
A robot or a monkey?
What do you wanna be,
A robot or a monkey?
