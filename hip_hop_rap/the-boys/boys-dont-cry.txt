You sit there on the couch
Sipping your scotch and ice
You turn the TV on
And tune me out again

So what would you say to me
If you could talk to me
You could ask anything
I wouldn't lie
But you're okay with this
Damaging awkwardness
So i'll just play it safe
And keep it inside
Boys don't cry

I used to hold your hand
So tight there was no question
But now even when you're near
I've never felt so alone

If you just stand beside me
I'll keep you in my life
Tell me how much you love me
And i'll be just fine
Don't be afraid of me
