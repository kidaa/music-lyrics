A healthy argument to start the day,
What better way?
We chew the fat of life,
We're moved to tears,
Lend me your ears.

But you spend all your time,
Waiting in static shopping lines,
And all your troublesome debates are solved,
In glossy magazines.

Too much small talk leads to a small mind,
So tell me what your views are,
And I will tell you mine.

How's the weather?
Grey and boring,
It's back to work on...
Monday morning.

Oh, let it go,
Tell me things I'd like to know,
Frighten me,
Enlighten me, oh no.

Opinion can be void if not,
Presented from both sides,
So speak your mind my dear,
Your loves and fears,
And nothing in between.

Initiate debates about,
The way you hate the things I slate,
I'd rather that than spend another,
Minute killing time.

Too much small talk leads to a small mind,
So tell me all your secrets,
I'll never tell you mine.

How's the weather?
Grey and boring,
It's back to work on...
Monday morning.

Oh, let it go,
Tell me things I'd like to know,
Frighten me,
Enlighten me, uh oh.
