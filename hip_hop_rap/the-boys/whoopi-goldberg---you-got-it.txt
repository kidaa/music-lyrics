the lyrics

Every time I look
Into your lovely eyes
I see a love that money
Just can't buy

One look from you
I drift away
I pray that you
Are here to stay

CHORUS:
Anything you want
You got it
Anything you need
you got it
Anything at all
you got it
Baby

Every time I hold you
I begin to understand
Everything about you
Tells me [I'm your best friend]

I live my life
To be with You
No one can do
The things you do

CHORUS

I'm glad to give
My love to you
I know you feel
The way I do

CHORUS
