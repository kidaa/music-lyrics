In Verona my late cousin Romeo
Was three time as stupid as my Dronio
for he fell in love
and then he died of it
poor half-wit!


This can't be love because I feel so well
no sob. No sorrow ,no sight
This can't be love I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
just here It beats
this is too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I fell so well
but still I love to look in your eyes


Though your cousin love my cousin Juliet
loved her with a passion much more truly yet
some poor playwright
wrote their drama just for fun,
It won't run!


This can't be love because I feel so well
no sob. No sorrow ,no sight
This can't be love I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
just here It beats
this is too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I fell so well
but still I love to look in your eyes
