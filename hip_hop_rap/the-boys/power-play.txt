They're out of order in war
They're out of order in love

They need to feed, they both agree
The hawk and the dove

But don't get mad, get even
And don't let 'em get to you

I never promised
It was fair and true
Before they're through
They'll have me hunting you

It's not important

Good and evil
They're neck and neck
Bases loaded
And there's three on left

We're in the final quarter
And it's runnning out
You'll need a father
Like there's no time out

He'll lift you out of the cradle
Help you into the grave

But don't be fooled by all the rules
And don't be the slave

You take a chill pill, and, baby
Relax, float downstream

Life is no rehearsal
You know what I mean
And freedom seems
To be a far-off dream

It's not important

Good and evil
They're neck and neck
Bases loaded
And there's three on left

We're in the final quarter
And it's runnning out
You'll need a father
Like there's no time out
