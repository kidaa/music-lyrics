Lyrics by Lorenz Hart, Music By Richard Rodgers. 
Introduced by Bob Lawrence, James Wilkinson, and ensemble. Alternate title: "He Had Twins."


Throughout the song the Policeman interprets the sounds
representing the words of the Duke and the Merchant,
Aegean, who are inside the courthouse. The Duke 's mouth
moves and we hear a bass clarinet, followed by the translation 
by the Policeman. When Aegean speaks, we hear an
E-flat clarinet, followed by the Policeman 's translation

CROWD: Hurrah! Hurroo!
There'll be an execution.
It serves him right.
The law makes retribution.
There's going to be a killing.
Hurrah! Hurroo!

CITIZEN: It serves him right.
Hurrah! Hurroo!
What did he do?

POLICEMAN: He came from Syracuse.

CROWD: No! No! No!

POLICEMAN: Yes! Yes! Yes!
So let him plead,
For what's the use?
The sap's from Syracuse!

CROWD: The sap' s from Syracuse!

POLICEMAN: Sh! Listen!
[Aegean E-flat clarinet pleads ]
[Duke bass clarinet answers ]

Yes-he dies!

CROWD: Good! That's one down!
[Duke]

POLICEMAN: He dies tomorrow at sundown.
Our rigid laws of Ephesus
Most rightfully refuse
A visa to any citizen
Of uncivilized Syracuse.
If any one of us would dare to go
To that barbaric city.
He'd get the ax the same as he--
That's why he gets no pity.

CROWD: 
Give him the ax, the ax, the ax-
Give him the ax, the ax-

[Duke ]

POLICEMAN: Unless he can pay a thousand marks,
Or borrow it from the local sharks.

[Duke]

Why did you come here?

[Aegean]

I had twins.

CROWD: 
He had twins.
That's nothing much agin him.
He had twins.

POLICEMAN: 
I never thought he had it in him.

CROWD: 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[Duke]

POLICEMAN: Is that why you came here?

[The Policeman now translates Aegean's story for him, 
each line coming first from Aegean 's E-flat clarinet 
and then sang by the Policeman ]

I had twins who looked alike,
Couldn't tell one from the other.
They had two slaves who looked alike,
Couldn't tell one from his brother.
But on one unlucky day .
We went sailing on the sea.
This was an unlucky blunder,
For our ship was torn asunder
Just like that!
Just like that!
Just
Like
That!
See?
One young twin went down with me,
One went swimming with his mother.
We were parted by the sea, .
Man and wife and slave and brother.
Now my one remaining brave boy
Went a-searching with his slave boy .
Having lost my son
And wife, too-
I will gladly give my life, too-
Just like that!
Just like that!
Just
Like
That!
See?
I have searched the isles of Greece
From my home to far-off Samos.
Didn't know your local laws.
I am just an lgnoramus.
I am sinless!
I am twinless!
I am wifeless!
I am lifeless!
I
Am
Glad
To
Die!
He had twins,
For them he'd give his life.
He had twins,
To say nothing of his wife.

CROWD: Hurrah! Hurroo!
There'll be an execution.
It serves him right.
The law makes retribution.
There's going to be a killing.
Hurrah! Hurroo!
What did he do?
He came from Syracuse.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
