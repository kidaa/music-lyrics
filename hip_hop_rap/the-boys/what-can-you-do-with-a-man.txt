LUCE: 
Listen to your lady who speaks.
This affair has run its course.
I'll reside in Athens six weeks
While I get me a divorce.

DROMIO: 
Listen to your lover who asks
Why this battle has begun.

LUCE: 
He has long neglected some tasks
That a husband should have done.


He eats me out of house and home
But doesn't like my cooking.
That's nothing new with a man.
What can you do with a man?
He likes to use my brush and comb
And yet he' s funny-looking.
Home's like a zoo with a man.
What can you do with a man?
Some men wear half pajamas.
I took a chance.
I bought the guy pajamas-
He wears the pants.
By day he's like a five-year-old;
At night he's ninety-seven.
What can you do with a man like that?

DROMIO: 
When you get mad, don't count to ten,
Go on and count a million.
Don't be a shrew with a man.
That's what you do with a man.
You need a regiment of men-
I'm only one civilian.
Wait for your cue with a man.
That's what you do with a man.
Marriage is such a blessing,
So I have found.
I've got a thousand blessings,
Each weighs a pound.
I'm only four foot ten right now,
I once was five foot seven.
That's what you did to a man like that!


LUCE: 
I wear my nicest negligee
And find him reading Plato.
Nothing is new with a man.
What can you do with a man?
I shook the tree of life one day
And got a cold Potato.
I'm in a stew with a man.
What can you do with a man?
Where is his sense of duty,
Where is his taste?
Acres and acres of beauty
Going to waste!
He walks me in the woods at night
To find a four-leaf clover.
What can you do with a man like that?
