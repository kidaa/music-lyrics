I know what you want
I know what you need
Better than you do
I know why you came
I promise you

I know where you go
I know what you do
Better than you do
When nothing remains
I come to you

Sometimes she shines, and I know
Beauty has her way
With her hooks and her grace
Beauty has her way
Lights down, we drown, and I know
Beauty has her way
This plain day
Beauty has her way

The trembling lengths
The conquering touch
Everything to you
And into your flame
I'll follow you

Where all wishes twist
And bitter they kiss
Everything to you
In doorways and dreams
I run to you

Sometimes she shines, and I know
Beauty has her way
With her hooks in your face
Beauty has her way
Lights down, we drown, and I know
Beauty has her way
This plain day
Beauty has her way

I know what you want
I know what you need
I know where you go
I know what you do

Sometimes she shines, and I know
Beauty has her way
This plain day
Beauty has her way

I know what you want
I know what you need
Better than you do
I know why you came
I promise you
