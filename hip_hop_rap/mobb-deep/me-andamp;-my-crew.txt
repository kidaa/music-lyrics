Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and

Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed

Hey yo I'm takin it Uptown, and niggaz know my name
Little shorty insane, so feel the pain
and the wrath of the five foot murder
I'm goin out baby uzi, style
Catchin bodies like I hit skins
The hostile juvenile, fuck what you heard
More four-five, motherfucker die
My crew is live and real with a street deal
Automatic causin havoc when I hit
I flip and rip shop I'm on some homicidal shit
Little nigga loco, catchin bodies on a solo
Props for killin cops I'm hellbound
I'm on a motherfuckin mission, I'm goin at it
You want a freestyle kid I'm wilder than the penile
Back up off me, give me room to breathe
And you takin up my spot?  Nigga please
I'm as bad as they come, there ain't nuttin good
Used to be a gentleman but you can call me hood
Matter fact, fuck that kid, you know my name
Peace I'm audi, me and my motherfuckin crw

Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed

Ah one two, microphone check, who's next?
The five foot three, time to catch wreck
Set the situation motivate your mind
I'ma, step ahead and not a step behind
Bass now come again, checkin for the little lyrical
??  and chat be milky like cereal
Poof I make you move when I move I bet I make you
buck I make you bugged as I kick the mega flavor
So I'm the kid just slippin the slang
What's my name, what's my motherfuckin name?
Fight, I make a fight motherfuckin buckwild
Shootin niggaz up like it's goin out of style
So rusty ?? sharpen up your blades
Load up the clip, take a sip, what's the flav
I roll the streets at midnight, the little terror
Huh, I get better by the letter
A true breed, head to juvenile once more
A twenty bag of funk, shall I say more?
A real lil nigga with real motherfuckin skills
Far from weak, so get off the fuckin deals
Do the do cause I'ma do mines too
Just chillin with my crew, peep the flavor

Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed

Check it
My man Hav' got my back with the tec 20
to shoot em up if the niggaz get funny
My shit is real, I had to pioneer in this
Around the way, all the fake niggaz fear this
Paragraphs bust your membrane
On and on I bust through like teflon
The Little P, is not to be stepped upon
And if you think so kid then you're dead wrong
Little, far from big, yo a type small kid
P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge
To make a long rhyme short I smoke weed
sip a forty, yo fuck the court
So bad they tried to lock me in a group home
Prodigy's hard but fuck it I can rip a ??
I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect
And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix
Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath
Even if you tooken notes, kid you couldn't pass the class
I keep a loosey in the chamber, cause beef got me shook down
Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around
So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it
So we can pop em off if the chumps want static

Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin and
front on this and get dissed

[Havoc]
Check it
When I rap I kill mics like a nuke blast
Little Hav's the man, the man gettin Van Damme
Buckwild, rockin with much style
Check it as I wreck it, strip ya buttnaked
Pause and stand still while I just split a Phil'
and double up on ki's and make somethin like a half-mil
Shorty's in it to get paid
No doubt, I got clout with the females
Put it in detail and write it
And if you ain't givin pussy, then bitch you ain't invited
I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with
Destructive, and couldn't give a fuck kid
Little niggaz don't die if they said so they lied
Immediate death to those who tried
The dark-skinned brother, unlike the others
When niggaz see my crew, they know to burn rubber
