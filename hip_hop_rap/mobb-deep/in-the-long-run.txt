Chorus / Havoc:
Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son
Extra cash just for more guns

Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son
Extra cash just for more guns

Let's start the warfare....

Ty Nitty:
Yo Ty Nitty, airforce one's call up my duns 
Got more niggas seeds on sesame buns
Caught a body on the run
You don't want none, lump some
Exort niggas for they lump sum no doubt 
Proceed,where that weed indeed
Havoc laced the track razor sharp, you bleed

Havoc:
My whole mission, like a platoon take position 
Ain't goin in if my clique can't get in
That's word to mines have you stressed like jail time
Get that loot up, no doubt I bail mines 
Easy access 
Shorty straight up hit the mattress 
Have you role playin just like a actress 
My tactics leavin niggas stuck doin back flips
I black out 
Take it to the gats 
Fuck this rap shit 
Let my niggas shine
Rate my rhymes like a dime

Swollen bullet wounds, head ass niggas

Prodigy:
Yo,
Who's the one to be made into example
Nigga you pop shit wit the wrong guys this time
What! gunshots
My mobb'll get on top ya, topple ya 
Like a fall guy you fell down clown
Heard some four pound sound my '86 style now gunshot
Ten years later still hold a firm ground 
Nigga P thugly 
Enter the ring wit something for anyone who wanna play gun
What up G
I'll clap you stop in your tracks, how about that
Now analyze these cats wit live nigga rap
You seen strapped, came outside all hype wit gats
Got juiced up, now bishop think he thuggin it black pimp
Let's rap a taste 
You get your little head pinched off 
Brooklyn touched you, then left you for Queens to finish off
Fuck a ----- Keith Murray and his whole clique
Yea, you snuffed me in front of the cops, that bullshit 
Told you come around the corner, no police and no witnesses 
Little to your knowledge 
You almost got shot but that's aiight though
I'm a catch ya ass again 
You fuckin immigrant ------ for two cent
My Mobb runnin shit you fuckin Carlton Ave coward
The forecast call for gray skies and gun showers

Chorus / Havoc:
Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son
Extra cash just for more guns

Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son
Extra cash just for more guns
