Eh yo this ones for all my m o b b
And my out of state niggas reppin NYC
To my duns up in the clink stuck in the thing
For my dogs on the corner that cook they own weight
For young lords livin like old time kings
And old timers puttin young bloods on them things
Just a lil something for ya block to sing
Can you relate? 
Do you feel me?
Aiight then

Mind like the dutch
Flow wit her backwards
Couldn't clear my style like Anita Baker Rapture
Frature
Cry now laugh later
We assist and compute data
On ya IBM
Dime bitches I be eyein them
Shoot me down a hundred times
Still come up wit new rhymes
Rec exects dont like me
Come up with new rhymes
See you want it and you give a push for all mankind

Eh yo this ones for all my m o b b
And my out of state niggas reppin NYC
To my duns up in the clink stuck in the think
For my dogs on the corner that cook they own weight
For young lords livin like old time kings
And old timers puttin young bloods on them things
Just a lil something for ya block to sing
Can you relate? 
Do you feel me?
Aiight then

Mike Tyson style
Animal duns
We live wild
Too many ways to die
We alive for now
We cross borders
Take the guns along with us
Defend imfamous to the fullest
Protect my duns that came with me
They move with me
Its risky
For you to try to approach the god shiftly
We all gorgeous
The most fly
The illest
Its amazing what my mens do to ya bitches
While you bearin witness
We handelin ya chick b'ness business
Thuggin out druggin out ya know the dealins 

Picture you dead and in the raw
Flippin 2 not ready for what you and 
Moms already missin you
Old fool from the old school
You 36
I been doin this since niggas sellin nicks
Gettin head from tricks
Takin shorts for kicks
Niggaz mad ain't tell them where the stash was at
If she a dime baby moms 
Know we baggin' that
Smack em with the gat
what React that

Eh yo this ones for all my m o b b

To my duns up in the clink stuck in the think

And to my fifth ward clique how you like this
And to my dirty south thugs how you like this
And to my westside niggas yes you like this
And to my Chi-town gangstas keep thuggin it

Connect the dots
Merge with many a block
My porto rock representitives blow plenty of shots
Its love sincerely
Even my heart
For those that relate to this here song

Thug of the age yo
Have you noddin off like good dope
And if the good then go regardless
Finish it when you want to start shit
Turn the body into carcus
Handle mines regardless

Eh yo this ones for all my m o b b

And for my midwest terrorists rock this
For my New Orleans team they cant stop us
And to my Little Rock clique y'all is heartless
This for my Beantown dogs in the life is
From Seattle to ping houses
Unified States of America lets get it right shit
