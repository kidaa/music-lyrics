[Intro - Nyce]
Yeah
It's The Unit man
Nobody do it like we do it you nahimsayin'?
Straight G's nigga, G's up nigga
Infamous Mobb Deep nigga
Y'all know what time it is man
We clip up over here nigga

What's Your Name Fool?

[Chorus - Prodigy]
Capital P, Bandana P, V-I-P, M-V-P
R-S-V-P or R-I-P, V-S-O-P, A-S-A-P

[Verse 1 - Prodigy]
P-C-P, P get piecy with the hoes
First they gotta come bless me
I'm, heaven's gift, heavy on the wris'
Heavy on the waist, memorise what I say so
When this shit goes down
You won't be surprised how this shit turns out
Im a gangsta you try my hand and get cut
And Hav by the raft for the AK dunn
I'm a menace, a millionaire, rich and I'm ruthless
You got plans at gettin' at P?
Don't do it
I'm a terror, white people call me black hearted nigga
My baby mom's left me, cuz she couldn't put up with my foul attitude
I'm so fucked up, and I love it
It got me to where I'm at dunn
If I had it to do over, I wouldn't change a thing
I would still shoot at world and his mom'z for that chain
I would still get cut and would still catch a fade
By the older thugs around the way What?
I would still get cut and would still catch a fade
By the older thugs around the way

[Nyce]
What's Your Name Fool?

[Chorus - Prodigy]
Capital P, Bandana P, V-I-P, M-V-P
R-S-V-P or R-I-P, V-S-O-P, A-S-A-P, and.

[Verse 2 - Havoc]
H-A-V, H get piecy with your hoes
First they gotta come bless me
I'm, heaven's gift, heavy on the wris'
Heavy on the waist memorise what I say
This is '06, '07, '08
You old school, fuck out my face
Who cares if you buyin' the rap
Now these rich little bastards got it on smash
We a new breed, not from the same game
Cut from the same cloth not from the same vein
If money ? flyin' out your mouth from talkin'
Then no comprende, your language is foreign
If your body language don't calm down humbly
Homicide homie if you move too suddenly
And don't fidget with your fingers
Cuz we would take that for a gang sign nigga
Revenge is food that tastes best served cold
But we like it better when it's fresh off the stove
You could get keep your things, we want your soul
So hot, even Satan gotta go

[Nyce]
What's Your Name Fool?

[Chorus - Havoc]
Capital H, A-V-O-C, H class diamonds, H-S-B-C
H killin' all these producers with his beats
Back seat of the H-3 you H-O-E

H-A-V, H get piecy with your hoes
first they gotta come bless me
I'm, heaven's gift, heavy on the wris'
heavy on the waist memorise what I say
