You ask me, all these rappers is bums
Hav show me the flow and i ran wit it dun
I mean really, you gotta be the most worst
rap shit i ever herd, compare to a P verse
We emerge on the scene, everything seen
than stop... watch as they bling bling
nigga wanna swing swing, they must show
And once we get in they ear, thats a rap broo
Our songs good to go, stragiht to the radiOO
Flex easy on the palm, let the niggas here the flow
of americas most, dangerous to have fans
new york new york, we the kings of the thang
party too much, smoke too much grass
and we never see the bright side, we only see the bad
Fuck all that, thers a lot of niggas dead
And i wont let em get me how they got them

Fuck brought your ass round here
Like you somebody lookin like you the playa of ?? boy
Fuck brought your ass round here
This Queens little homie Get caught around here yah
Fuck brought your ass round here
Comin thru for these bitches, shit happen around here yah
Fuck brought your ass round here
Like niggas got somethin to live for round here
