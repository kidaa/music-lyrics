M.O.B.B. nigga yeah a huh
Uh yeah cmon now yeah yo yo 

Aint no party once we crash the party
Imma squeeze shorty then vacate the party
You keep grillin Ill pump pump the shotty
Put you in the trunk then dump dump the body
Nigga you dont know you betta ask somebody
Yall get down we gonna clash prob'ly
Builty snowflake out of the ampacomby
Im tryin to rip Britney so I made Jive sign me
Nigga catch me in tha club with a double lead banger
Im the wrong one to fuck with
Now I know the promoters im in with the musket
Pound of the haze and a box of dutches
High to the cottonmouth 
Paranoid make the wrong move bitch and your ass is out
Like M.O.P. nigga Ill mash you out
If I can't get your head swing by your house motherfucker

[Chorus]
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge  U-Charge
That truth come out when you drunk
Your ass wont make it to see tomorrow
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge U-Charge
That truth come out when you drunk
Your ass wont make it to see tomorrow

[Bridge]
We step up in the club with one thing 
On our mind thats leave with something
Get rid of that ring get rid of those cuffs
We about to...girl
We about to...girl
We about to...girl girl
We about to...girl
We about to...girl girl

Yo, party over here aint shit over there
The Mobb Deep boys got it locked right here
Wherever we at we keep the cliqs right there
So where ever theres beef is gettin fixed right there
And they cant stop us, they too scared
They know a caliber thug  shoot at heads nigga
Q.B. drop you off at that bridge bye bye
Show you how we do it in Queens 
Murder aint shit nigga
This is P talking show you where I live 
You come right through my crib cmon and get a few seers 
There'll be manslaughter right in front of my kids
A little blood get on my daughter, thats nothing she'll live just whipe that off
Got cops shoot to death of us
We dont like D's
You never catch us runnin with the police nope
Ya'll niggas get ya'll vests up
And ya'll better invest in some real heavy bulletproof paneling

[Chorus]
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge U-Charge
That truth come out when you drunk
Your ass wont make it to see tomorrow
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
That liquor up in your U-Charge U-Charge
That truth come out when you drunk
Your ass wont make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club with one thing 
On our mind thats leave with something
Get rid of that ring get rid of those cuffs
We about to...girl
We about to...girl
We about to...girl girl
We about to...girl
We about to...girl girl
