YouknowwhatI'msayin'? I wanna say what's up to my man, Louie you know he's
still here. Drop this one for you you know. For those that only know. 41st
side word up yo this beat is ill.

[Havoc:]
I keep it real pack steel like my man Y.G.
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm swayze
You must be crazy kid 
Man I never did forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared cock back the gat then hit a nigga like a big
25 naw kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell niggas is trife
It's the, semi auto you can bring it on yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised G
Slept ? stage have you slippin' down blazin'
In pools of alcohol walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this you gonna take a fall
Infamous Queensbridge kid we on the scene kid
Creepin' for those that's caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew back my every move 
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Damey
Obey me or get sprayed with the street sweeper
Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big ?hedence? 
Blow ya three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you I know how to fix you
Pretty boy frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get cross
Put your right on your back take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle the 41st side get bent run wild
The 41st side too you know how we do
Violate motherfucker I'm a see you, with the linden
It's the start of your endin' settin' it again and again

scarred. Big shoot out to my man Heavy L. Big Palms representin'. 

[Prodigy:]
Yo it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come alone only the hoes can enter
Told him to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated never sober
Face it, violate and get laced while you wastin' 
Slugs you ain't buckin' nothin'
You better off buckin' yourself you need to stop frontin'
I use to drive an Ac and kept a mac in the engine
Little painted it black with crack sales intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous 
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me accompanied by the Coniac
You can ask around don't fuck with the Mobb
I could of told you that where you been at?
You must of cut class
If it ain't me another member of my crew will kick your ass
what what? Who do damage to limbs 
In '91 stompin' you out with black Tims
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C.
Puttin' cowards where they're suppose to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree 
And to the kids you don't wanna be me 
I'm up in the mix of action when niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they endin' my man's lendin'
Me his linden 42 shots dependin' 
On wheather or not the clip is full to the top
We bustin' caps non stop 
Blazin' in all the shows and even at the hoes

[Outro:]
Naw naw chill son chill

And it's the start of your ending
Yeah yeah it's the start of niggas endin' youknowhatI'msayin?
And it's the start of your ending
All y'all weak ass crews that got drama with mines you knowhatI'msayin'

And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending
You know who you fuckin' iwth yeah yeah nigga you know what will happen
