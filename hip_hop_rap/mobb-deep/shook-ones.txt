I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
you heard of us
official Queensbridge murderers
the Mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware
of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
for all those who wanna profile and pose
rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nosebone
you all alone in these streets, cousin
every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin'
and keep them shook crews runnin'
like they supposed to
they come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face
you're in the wrong place
cowards like you just get your whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such
speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
you can put your whole army against my team
I guarantee you it'll be you very last time breathin'
your simple words just don't move me
you're minor, we're major
you all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
don't make me have to call your name out
your crew's featherweight
my gunshots will make you levitate
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
another nigga deceased, another story gets told
it ain't nothin' really
hey, yo son spark that Phillie
so I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
why they still alive I don't know, go figure
meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation
when I die I couldn't choose a better location
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
getting closer to God in a tight situation
now, take these words home and think it through
or the next rhyme I write might be about you


chorus
Son, they shook...
'cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
scared to death, scared to look
X2

they shook



For every rhyme I write, its 25 to life
yo, it's a must the gats we trust are safeguardin' my life
ain't no time for hesitation
that only leads to incarceration
you don't know me, there's no relation
'cause Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for your petty thinking mind
son, I'm bigga than those claimin' that you're packing heat
but you're scared to hold
and when the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid
you talk a good one but you don't want it
sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
no time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
front if you want kid, lay on your back
I don't fade that shit
you know I bring it to you live
stay in a child's place, kid you out of line
criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin' E&J;, got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin'
******** for huslin'
get that loot kid, you know my function
'cause as long as I'm alive I'm gonna live illegal
and for that I'm gonna put it on my people
react to shit like Macs I hit your dome up
when you're peepin', don't get caught sleepin'
'cause I'm creepin'
