Yeah she'll take you out too kid.

A rainy day layed up thinkin
Sitting gettin bent
Watchin old seventy flicks
Minds on the slouch
Back on the couch
Heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from uptown I met back day.
Long time no hear from
No doubt long time no see
I heard you had a seed a baby girl and now she 3.
Whats up wit that cat
You know who your baby pops
Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked
He home
Fuck dat nigga I'm on my own
Matter fact got my own crib
Plus Im all alone
Word
The bitch is bad
Chill son she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty
Jumped in the ride I rented
rest Tims
Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E  amp; J straight
Was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug
Stared her straight into her mug
She aint shes a bithch back then and now its bugged
Turned the VCR on
Friday, my favorite flick
Its hard for me to drink Alize I take a sip
Got into convo, How you been over the years
Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear
Whatchu mean, I thought you left that cat which was true
Im not talkin about him
Another dude
Been wit him for a year and had a baby by him -- Word
Matter fact you saw him, downstairs you walked by him
Now thinks its a setup
Could it be or maybe not.
She said dont sweat it he dont got the top lock
Tried to play it cool. But in my head shorties wildin
Using me to get the next nigga jealous called up the fellas.
Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti, Gotti was
with Trip and two other grimees, The Twinz
Let me begin then explain
Im at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat
Now prepare for combat,
Gave the address, told my son theres more cats be here in a second
Big gats no half steppin
They flippin on me talkin bout I never learn my lesson
I laughed an additional hit them with the math
Hung up the jack, While shorty soaked in the bath.
Played the living room.
Dozed off for a second.
When I woke up shorty was standing ass naked.
Make moves stepped to the room.
All this bullshit pussy better be good
Through off my champion hood
Slow motion
All arm bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over Laid up in the cut
I heard a thump
Jumped up threw on my boxers
Yo, What the fuck
All of a sudden
I saw this black motherfucker with this big ass gat and two other
motherfuckers
Black masks, Clutching duct tape no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasnt even screamin
Looked up saw 'em schemin
 quot;Yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this quot;
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up
Held for ransom, they yelled, smiled and started dancin
Let them know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone said son
Dont worry son we got this
Regardless of the outcome
All this bullshit
Take a nigga word
Dont never go see a bitch, word
