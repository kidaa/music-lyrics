ruthless, as a child, a juvenile
ran with TRU, slanged in the meanwhile
packin, specialize in jackin
liquor store, dope dealers, brothas and others
open shop, it's all about a come up
I'm in a crackhouse waitin on the bubble up
because I'm a gangsta sellin dope
strapped with a gat when I role through the Calliope
bad ass, I never listened to my brother
it went in one ear and out the fuckin other
pushin rocks on the block watch the undercover
fuck a dick suckin bitch, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a killa, dope dealer, looking for some dollars
at 13 I bought a quarter key of powder
rollin with my fingas on the trigga
brother don't  ya know you can't touch this nigga
a thug, convict, psycho, a criminal
do you stay open, ganked for your yayo
big and bad, no respect for the taz
[Reporter] C-Murder did you ever go to jail
hell yea, just servin niggas heroin
runnin from the taz, hidin out by the sewers
I'm a TRU nigga fuck em puttin in work
I wear some baggy ass jabros and a motherfuckin saints shirt
slappin all the fiends gettin on my nerves

I'm bout to do some shit you wont believe
creep like a G to the back of the house
look in
all the lights were out
grabbed the door and it was locked G
but fuck that shit, a nigga got a spare key
stuck it in slowly, so he wouldnt wake up
infared, ready to blow the place up
once inside no time for shakin
lookin for the nigga and the dope I be taking
get what you gonna get, nigga and ride
or get 25 for a mothafuckin homicide
move quickly but no stuntin
ssssshhhh, I hear a motherfucka coming
lights came on, So I shot BangBang
out the door with the dope that I got
over the wall, don't fall
check my dope cause this was a close call
getting robbed by the C is a lesson
