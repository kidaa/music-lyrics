[Chorus]

Is there a heaven for a gangsta gangsta gangsta ughh 2x
Is there a heaven for a gangsta

[Master P]

Grew up in the ghetto raised by a killa
 TRU across my stomach 
your neighborhood thug nigga 
Trying to make it out this fucked up environment 
Where niggaz die trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents 
The ghetto got me crazy 
I smell daisies 
But I can't die tonight my old lady pregnant with a baby 
2Pac said is there a heaven for a g 
But I wonder if there's a resting place for killas and gangstas like me 
Been fucked up for most my life 
done sold my soul to the devil 
I hope I die in my sleep I know its gonna be a 187 
Ain't no turning back I'm strapped with 2 crome gacks 
I See death around the corner 
My time to go I'm ready black 
Cause I'm a soldier gone off that douja 
Aint no crying at my funeral I lived life to the fullest a high roller 
So when I die put me in a pine box 
Bury me like a g 2 glocks and a fucking bag of rocks 
And open up clouds for a stranger 
Before you take me Lord tell me 

[Chorus]

[Silkk]

Just a young nigga addicted to fast cars fast money and fast bitches 
Git me blasting til its the mothafucking last nigga 
Its gone be hard trying to get to heaven cause my life is mostly marred 
All I see is 2 levels and 187 sell a nigga ?? 
So living gangstafied and gang banging 
You know just imaging niggaz be acting bad up there
if they had a heaven for a gangsta 
Block parties all days til we get tired, free sex like the sixties 
Nigga drinking up on some forties, nigga pumping up on some swishies 
Dice game every hour 
For the gangstas money and power 
Rewards for niggaz that's bout it 
Extra time for busters and cowards 
Cause every nigga on the block I know
will be living in mansions and riding old school 
If I was born to be the fucking president
everythin I ride would be on some gold shoes 
Is there a heaven for a gangsta I can't wait 
Even have some bitches crying trying to get into the gate 

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]

Is there a heaven for a mothafucking gangsta ass nigga like me  I doubt it 
Cause niggaz like me down south New Orleans stay bout it 
Swamp niggaz, 
TRU Soldiers 
fill your head with lead 
I ain't scared to die I'll smoke your ass like douja 
Retaliation is a must so I bust 
Your ass be on the run I can't keep bullets up in my fucking gun 
They ask me why am I so sick, 
its because of my click 
Full of murders and robbers, rehabilitated convicts 
Rest in peace to all my fucking dead niggaz that took the stand 
Lord forgive me but I know I'm going to hell man 
I walk the streets with my converse, khakies and my chrome gack 
Pockets full of drug money and crack, heroin 
Will I ever see the man upstairs I know my chances are slim 
Cause God don't want no killas standing next to him 
So I'm a hustle and sell my D dopeman
But I wonder is there a heaven for a gangsta nigga like me 

[Chorus x4]
