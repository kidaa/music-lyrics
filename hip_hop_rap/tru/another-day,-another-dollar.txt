[Master P]
Yeah, T-R-U, all about the paper chase
Young Silkk, 'bout to take y'all foos on a journey

[Silkk the Shocker]
Seems it's a trip what niggas 'll do
for a grip in this day and age
See I be tryin' to get paid and
keep my game sharper than a fade like that
Ridin' through the hood in somethin' tight
like the Coupe that's dropped
Have them niggas starin' while they glarin'
when I hit tha blockwoo shit
On my way to check me a motherfuckin' grip
it's about that time
I got my hand upon my nine
plus my money be on my mind
Stay away from these niggas
that be shady like a tree
I try to show 'em love
and get ta thinkin' they can be me
But a nigga I'll blast you
if I have towhy?
Because cash rulesdamn

[Chorus]
[Silkk] x2
Another day another dollar
I'm all about that money an power
And if ya feel me then holla
if you can't you's a coward
I'm all about tha dollar bills that I make
It's a day another dolla
another dolla another day

[Master P]
Dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla bill y'all...x3
Dolla bill y'all
Dolla dolla bill y'all
Dolla dolla dolla bill y'all

[Silkk the Shocker]
Bitch I'ma G nigga like all tha way
So nigga they betta just fall away
talkin' gangsta shit
And still cross-over like Hardaway
I do more pimpin' than Scottie
A nigga fuckin' violent,
plus i'm silent, so you know a nigga a 'bout it
whassup, whassup
And some of these niggas show
they don't understand
Cause if I don't die or
go to the penuh huh
Shit huh, I'ma be tha mandamn
And I be quick to hop in
some gangsta shitlike that
See if I had a quarter
for ever nigga told me they gonna major
Shit, I be rich
Kinda had flow ons
them gold thangs spinnin' like some diamonds
With my clique right behind me
nigga you know, just where to find me
Just tryin' to get a buck,
comeup on the cut before the taz hit
But I been in this game so long
shit, I done mastered it
By any means
the more fiends, the more green I have
I just kick back
and watch them, go out and get tha cash
and then I laughha ha ha ha
I'm just all about my paper[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
I stay TRU to tha ghetto
even if I make a mill'
Cause that's the only place I can go
when I'm broke and I keeps it trill
You besta believe
how I be about my mailwhat?
Whether it be sun out,
rain, snow, sleet, or hail
You know I gots to, watch my back
and be 'for shure black
they can't fuck with you
Beacause it's a proven factwhat?
that some of these hoes jacktell 'em
I stay posted and be major
they trip
Cause how can I have a grip
and only be a teenager
You know they can't fade me
but they will trynah they can't fuck with you
Even though I wear a vest
and two straps you know I'ma still diedamn
But until then I'm 'bout my paper black
Cause ain't no turnin' back
and ain't no savin' thatsavin' that
Can't take nothin' with me
so I guess I'll be a dead G
And ain't need for cryin' over me

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Heh, young Silkk
T-R-U, heh, we 'bout that money
tha paper chase you know what I'm sayin'
Breakin' bread, it's all real
We all 'bout tha motherfuckin'
dividends, dollars, mulah, money, cabbage
Or whateva the fuck you wanna call it
