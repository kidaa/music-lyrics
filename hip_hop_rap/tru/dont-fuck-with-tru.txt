Niggaz ain't gonna ever ever, not bust no guns
Niggaz is way down the street talkin bout what the fuck y'all done 
at the most niggaz, probably wanna cuss and run
Now we self made million-aires
We make the money, money don't make us make us
If y'all was us, and we was y'all then I would hate us ehehe
Y'all talk about how y'all wanna be us
Y'all ain't nuttin but a bunch of hood critics
It's cause we rap now, shit y'all still would hit it

chorus

[Master P]
TRU niggaz gone ride wit me
The ghetto's the NBA and I'm the lottery
Pick from the streets... from the South to the East
You the Beauty I'm the Beast
Fuck these niggaz they know who P
From rags to riches, from quarter to seven-fifty
Holla Hoody Hooo and my niggaz gonna deal with ya
I got the game from my homies

Niggaz rappin bout niggaz on records like the 80's,
nigga y'all niggaz phony
