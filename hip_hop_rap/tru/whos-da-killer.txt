and while your dead wipe your blood up with bounty
from the corner to the hearse and that assed up

waiting for a foo to come when its my way

I couldn't breath I was lying in my tin bed
when a goon grabbed me by my fucking forhead
he picked me up and put me across his fucking shoulder
I said Bitch you let me die like a soldier
