Master P: TRU niggaz stand... 
Silkk Master P echoing: Raise your right hand. Repeat after me. I
pledge 
allegiance, to the game of the United Streets of A-fucking-merica. And 
not to be fucked with, for which it stands, one nation, under the 
dope game, with liberty and money for all. Gangstas that is, gangstas 
that is... 

Chorus: Gangstas make the world go round, Gangstas make the world
go round, 
I know, I know 
Gangstas...round, gangstas..round, you know, you know 
Gangstas...round, gangstas...round, we know, we know 
Gangstas...round, gangstas...round. 

[Silkk] 
Hah! I live and die, so I'm a die by the 9 
Fuck the dumb shit, I run this, a whole life of crime 
Ain't never had shit, but always had my pistol, bitch 
187, don't make me whistle, bitch 
I never know, for sho, picture this 
Never die, bitch, never die, say a damn thang 
Canes in the chains, became the dope thang 
Snortin some cane will make you do some strange thangs 
I don't know why I idolize gangstas like Tony Montana, 
Lucky Luciano, probably cause they went out bangin 
Gangstas like Machine Gun Kelly 
Rest in peace 2Pac, AKA Makaveli 
He run the chamber for danger, can't understand why these strangers 
Wanna ride with us killas, but they can't fuck when we hang em 
Gangstas like Kadofy, John fuckin Gotti 
Ain't fuckin with these snitches cause they got em for his shotty 
Gangstas 

Chorus 

[Master P] 
Uuuunnnngggghhhh! Just a young nigga hangin with the thugs 
From the ghetto so a nigga learned to slang drugs, 
From OZs, to flip keys, 
Eye blood red shot nigga smokin dank weed 
And quick to slap a bitch in a minute 
Fiends better have my money, I mean every penny 
Youngsta, kickin with the hustlas 
Fuck school, tryin to serve a clucka 
And moms, wish she never had me 
Cause I'm a nigga on the block slangin candy 
Ready to die for this true shit 
Takin penetentiary chances tryin to get rich 
My role models Frank Nitti, Scarface, and John Gotti 
Real gangstas, that's bout it, bout it 

Chorus 

[C-Murder] 
Throw your muthafuckin guns up TRU! 
Cause I represent Gangsta Day uh-huh 
A g-a-n-g-s to the t-a 
Ain't lookin for no shit but if shit comes what's up, what's up 
Ready to turn your muthafuckin body numb 
And fuck the pen, cause if I go to jail again 
I pop a plea, and I'm free, in 5 to 10 outee 
A nigga talk shit so I banged and I step 
Another notch upon my rep killa 
Like the last tape a nigga say fuck you hoes, 
Now I'm turnin bustas, into John Does 
I'm the nigga with TRU upon my back C-Murder 
A gangsta that's strapped so you can't jack 
Ain't nuthin but killas on my team, soldiers 
And I'm hangin with the Shocker and the Ice Cream 
Beware, my mental status is flawed, crazy 
Start bangin and muthafuckas get lost, 
You got drama with this muthafuckin TRU click? uh-oh, uh-oh 
Big Worm, this nigga need his wig split 
Take him to the river, cut his head off cut it 
Target practice for my goddam sawed off 
That's how we handle shit, in my town 
Cause gangstas make the muthafuckin world go round 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Round and round you go, 
Now tell me who's the realest muthafucka that you know 
Black Lucianio, hangin niggaz out the window 
like a fat pig and ?Ferejano? 
Winnin gun battles like Geronimo 
Say hello to my new friend, Mr. MAC-10, 
With the infrared grin, I can't pretend, 
Who I be, the S-E-R-V aka Billy Badgate 
Jack you for your safe, with guns in your daughters face 
Catchin chase for my case for murder, you ain't never heard of a 
Nigga, with nuts big like bison, 
Unified, gangstafied champ like Tyson, world introducin 
Young Billy Blast Em Up, I gives a fuck, all about my double up 
Catchin bubble up, now I'm here to let you know 
bitch you better give it up 
Don't lay it down, I'll make your world go round 

[Master P] 
TRU niggaz make the world go round 
gangstas make the world go round repeat 2X 

Chorus and fade
