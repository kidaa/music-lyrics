I remeber when we were kids
We shed all our hurt and tears and tears
No matter what the weather, what the weather
We were always togerther always together
We grew up as time went on
We became seperated seperated

 chorus 2x
It was a sad day it was a sad day
When my homie went away  when my homie went away
It was a sad day it was a sad day
When Kevin went away when Kevin went away

 Master P 
Kevin life aint tha even tho we gots tah change
see momma dont understand  how you died in tha game
and grandma get older, Little Kevin hes a soldier
we done made it out da ghetto aint no more run'n for tha rollers
tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
you said ";P be strong"; with out you   we all alone
I know its been a few years  you your birthday we shed tears
and i don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

It was a sad day it was a sad day
when my homie went away when my homie went away
it was a sad day it was a sad day
when my homie went away when my homie went away

 Silkk 
LooK --  Just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean im hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
and when you left,  part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin  shhh  ya'll would cry too
just think'n about you, if you were still here 
how much different remenisin on one of your pictures 
lookin at the family  thinkin we always got one miss'n
and I can still remember tha last words and mine aint even started
look your never forgotton cuz on your birthday  i go and put flowers on your 
grave
I still remember when P and C broke tha news to me at school about your death
told me ";Silkk time would heal our wounds"; 
Its been oh five years and i aint healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong 
I know moms tryin to hold on 
even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, thats why i cant move on
Its somthing about you

It was a sad day it was a sad day
when my homie went away when my homie went away
it was a sad day it was a sad day
when my homie went away when my homie went away

 C-Murder 
Now as i could remember remember
A couple of months before December December
I still can't take tha pain
we all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson,  could your blessings
watch your enemys and watch your friends
and if it aint your blood dont show that man no love
cuz kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
and the vultures commin to get you
when none of ur real homies is wit ya
and its sad  cant break the cycle 
and take a drink wit my uncle Michael
and my momma question my silence
but i blame this sinceless violence
don't wanna wake up cuz when imma asleep 
you still alive up in my dreams 
a few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
and then Kevin its like you ghost  my body freeze when ever i see him
If anybody got yours ways,  you know it'd be him

repeat 2x
it was a sad day it was a sad day
when my homie went away when my homie went away
it was a sad day it was a sad day
when my homie went away when my homie went away
