Silkk talking: I don't know if you listening but..

[Silkk the Shocker]
I got so many questions I don't know where to start
[ Wellwhy don't you start from the pain that runs deep in your heart]
Is that you? God is that you?  ....... It's me
Is there a heaven or a hell, if so is that theory true?
[Yes my son]
Why go through so much?
[It's a test my son]
So I guess it was you when ?? gave me the last second to run
[Yes]
And I don't know why I shed so many tears
Forgive my God, I haven't been to church in months
[Aww son you haven't been to church in years]
Some times I rob, steal and kill, just to eat
I popped him, I don't know if I killed him but somebody died in my building D
[He's here with me]
You think you can forgive me for my sins?
If so hold up, another homie died ?? you think you can forgive me again?
[I don't know]
Some times I feel like death is chasing me but just ain't catch me yet
I'm wondering if he is going to catch me when I stop to catch my breath
They say days are cut shorter from the things that you did
And if so then why take the kids?
[Hold up, hold up my son]
Huh?
[It seems like some puzzle to you, if you got something to ask me, ask me]
Why is it racism? Where did drugs come from?
Why is it so much death where I live? Who idea was it to make guns?
[Y'all]
And why my grandparents was slaves?
And why is is diseases with no cure like cancer and aids?
Why is it rich and poor?
Why is it a death row? [For real]
[That was y'all I ain't have nothing to do with it that was never my will]
And though I try and do everything, I just wanna know if it is worth it
[It was]
Sometime I feel like I'm doing it all, sometime I just don't feel like I 
serve my purpose
[Keep your head up]
Nigga scared of the past
All my homies wanna know but scared to ask
[Tell them to ask]
God everybody for they self Sometime I don't feel like I'm all alone
[Feel you]
Don't worry bout me if I have to go so watch my brother them when I'm gone
And what about when I couldn't pay my bills I was almost kicked out where I 
lived
[I just wanted to see if you'll break]
And everything happened at the same time
[I just wanted to see how much pain you can take]
And you must know my lifestyle
[I do]
Knowing I can't change my life
[I don't want you to, do what you gotta do anything not neccassary you'll pay 
the price]
So why did my homie die instead of me?
[Because I had bigger plans]
I don't understand
[I'll explain, see I wanted you to grow up and be a better man]
I wanna know, how you determine who dies and who stays living?
[The day I made the world my son, it was written]
Look I gotta couple mo' questions I need to know
[What?]
God, can you tell me, when is it my time to go?
everything goes silent
Silkk talking: Where you at? I wasn't finish asking you.
