Ain't one of our fucking kind. It's okay, it's okay.

Verse 1
Yo its rules to this shit
and you can't break none of 'emnone of 'em
It'll cost you nigga
so you can't break one of 'emone of 'em
Never get high
on your own supply
Never stunt, never get front nigga
more than you can buy
If a nigga's down on his luck
never fuck wit him right?
If a nigga rollin'
never fuck wit a nigga dice
Nigga ain't fuck wit you
never fuck wit a nigga life
No matter how good she look
never fuck wit a nigga wife
If a deal go down
then get the chrome
Never look suspicious when the switch is on
If you think you're tapped up
then switch your phone
Think a nigga watchin' your house
then switch your home
Always check your money
in case the shit gets off
You bought into it, know what you gotta do female
dish it off
Never talk back
gotta respect the boss
Never leave witnessesbeepbeepbeepbeep
gotta check the pulse

Chorus
The world is yours if you follow the rules and play by it
All you got is balls and words, now stay by it
The streets of rap is still do or die
No matter where the fuck you at, the same rules apply
The world is yours if you follow the rules and play by it
All you got is your balls and words, you gotta stay by it
The streets of rap is still do or die
No matter where the fuck you at, the same rules apply

Verse 2
I done fucked wit killers in the south
east and west niggas hard
Fucked wit dealers in the north
the rest is broad
Every now and then you might catch me sexin' a star
Ain't no fault the only person I trust is
my guns and guard
We ghetto D.O. nigga and bounce to dat
All my rap sales and crack sale couldn't amount to dat
If I get caught wit more than a ounce of crack
I plead, take a three then I bounce right back
Niggas can't wait to take my placeplace
Niggas can't wait till I make a mistake
That's why I spin it all
cuz I know I can't take it wit me
Some jealous muthafuckers out there can't wait to get meAhhhh!!!!
That's why I check that nigga
If I don't feel that nigga
I'm like ";Dude, that's my dog,
how you can't be real wit a nigga?
How you gonna steal from me nigga?
See niggas will drill you nigga";
But boss that's gonna cost
Well, bill me nigga

Chorus

Verse 3
Look, nigga

Type of nigga that your family don't want you hangin' round 
cuz I'm bad news
Drop the hot shit, so I cock shit.....
