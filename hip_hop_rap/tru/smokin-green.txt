And these hoes on my nuts, cause I got that weed 
Keep em 2 for 5, niggaz I got it 4 for 3 
Holla at yo boy, if you wanna get high 
I keep that green when I'm rollin in my dope ride 
Lickin on that sweet, split it with your fingernail 
Dump the tobacco out, pass the green dank that's real 
Turn up the bass on the 18s 
Roll up the window cause a nigga can't lose no swisha sweet 
Smoke, and let my niggaz choke, 
And if you can't handle that dank, get your ass out my car bro 
We been smokin since '83,

You got twenty let's go half on a 40, 
Stop the Lac at Motel 6, it's time to get retarded 
Bitch ask me for a shotgun, I'm bout that

Talkin bout, she high as a kigitty-kite 
But we been fuckin and smokin dank all fuckin night 
Made it home mama smellin on a nigga shirt 
Say it smell like chronic, I mean that green dirt 
Got a nigga fiendin, flippin to lunch
