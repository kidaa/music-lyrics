[2Pac] 
Got me up against the fence, back against the wall 
Get to actin like a fool, cause ain't no justice for the dog 
Got to take it out on all y'all, better read the papers 
all my homies goin crazy baby only God could save us 
got my, min on currency hurry see I ain't worried 
It's a gangsta party, so Bad Boy gettin buried 
Snoop Dogg, why they fantasize?  fantasize 
When we ride, it's a must havin sets die, everytime 

[Snoop Dogg] 
*singing* 
Yes yes y'all, not $hort but Snoop Dogg 
And you know it's like that y'all 
*rapping* 
I'm so smooth about my paper check it just how it's done 
I'm servin any on a platter Snoop Dogg Corleone 
Corleone, now do you know what that mean? 
A Teflon Don to this hip-hop game, super supreme 
It's like what happen can happen but will it stop 
that won't happen I'm feelin good about the mission for jackin 
*singing* 
Aiyyo patnah, can you feel me? 
Why these fools, tryin ta kill me? 
*rapping* 
It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize 
But if I don't, the Dogg won't survive 

[2Pac] 
We ballin in my opinion eternal was wild wheel spinnin 
One sip a minute is represented for five minutes 
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive 
we riders inventers because we ain't quiet and watch the G's ride 
Two of Amerikkkaz Most, straight out the West Coast 
Bow down fool, this is Death Row 
Been waitin way too long, bust out the pen, now it's on 
C'mon, Snoop Dogg, time to bone 

[Snoop Dogg] 
Ain't nuttin changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme 
Me and the homey Pac trippin Death Row on knobs 
Gon survive by Eastside of DPG'z 
Still creepin bump through the hood, always involved in the streets 
Westside! Snoop Doggy Dogg homey, did you forget who I was 
The Big Homey to you, there it is and there it was... 
Now take a look through the eyes of G 
and just ride to the rhythm of a gangsta beat 

[2Pac] 
All my homies tellin, me, ain't no love for a real G 
You straight cowards all you playa haters kill me 
Throw up your hands if you feel me 
We gettin dollars homey Holla If You Hear Me 
It's one time for my comrades doin bad lockdown 
Fresh out bust the top and bounce drop down 
Can you visualize perfection? 
Cause every rider in my set labelled a vet best in their profession 
Don't hold your breath, stick to Smith and Wessun 
Steady study your lessons to keep the crowd guessin 

[Snoop]
