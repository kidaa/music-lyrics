The Dogg Pound and the LBC, your baby is awaiting you, 
Thats that damn Snoop Dogg again, he aint nothin but a fuckin pimp 

Man snoop you got a bad curve, when i grow up i wanna be just like you 

Look here little homeboy, let me tell you somethen, 
Don't let me ever hear you say you wanna be like me, 
You could be a doctor, a lawyer, a football player, a laker, anythen, 
Just don't let me ever hear you say you want to be like me, 
You hear me? 

Yah Huh 

Now take these dollars and go give em to your brothers and sisters 
and you run on to school 

Thanks Snoop.
