Midnight love, midnight love, midnight love, midnight love, ohhhhh 

Chorus: Raphael Saadiq 

midnight love 
troubles plots on thee mind 
midnight love 
leave your back door open 
midnight love 
this heaven's ready for me 
midnight love 
back door little druggie's callin for you 

[Snoop] 
I'm makin things cappin fast 
ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along 
face lookin stupid broke startin 
feelin dumb, I'm young but I'm a grown man 
takin thangs into my own hands 
I'm tryin to own here 
but life a twist ya like a twister 
get twisted with this 
it seems on but its off 
I keep missin this shit 
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide out 
lookin dead at the chips 
I blink they dip 
its hard to hang on but I can't let go 
smokin on my last breath 
blow out life whats left is death 
now I can go on or I can G or make a right 
whatever way that I turn its still death after life 
it dont discourage me, I ain't got nuthin to lose 
but some punks that probably never turn the money to burn 
but I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G 
but these problems probably havin niggaz prayin to see 
at an early age so at an early stage in life 
I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight 
it cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees 
and I'm tryin to keep my sanity God help me please 

Chorus 

Mischeavius and devious is how my life was 
puttin the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggaz buzzed 
some of the money makin muthafuckaz from the other side 
was thinkin about a jack move tryin to whoo-ride 
gettin jealous cuz my music got this rap game sewn up 
them niggaz wanna trip whatever back they get blowed up 
blown up or not you can still get shot 
you dont never play those muthafuckaz I'll always not 
rule number one, pay attention to this shit 
dont be fuckin wit my niggaz on the midnight shift 
shit shiggy shack, gettin it on, to the break of dawn 
now he's known for servin more than an oz. so 
he's got a 187 on his muthafuckin chest 
a strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest 
he's lookin for the music from the night before 
trouble 1, he layin low all in gettin that dough 

Chorus 

[Daz] 
Now its all about the dollars 
Impalas that bounce 
havin cars and bitches on a proper amount 
caught a million chillin 
robbin banks for many muthaz son 
life and darkness 
we all get it started, cold hearted 
all around it my life won't change for the good 
as soon as I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood 
Daz, would you come and ride for me, 
hey yo Daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me 
the tradition's got a lot of niggaz killin for dumb shit 
the OGs think then brung guns to control shit 
every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite 
besides with the drama the dog fight street fight 
and a lot a mob puttin on mo 
problems solved, but revolved whatever with a fo-fo 
but sure I did the record blast five times 
254 sentence to jail time 


Midnight love 
I've been walkin the street 
midnight love 
I put my life on the line 
midnight love 
Cuz I've just gotta be me 
midnight love 

Chorus
