Khaki suit which one the blue one, gun by
My side, as I mob to the beach, on a mission
and I'm fishin

and see where my loves at, on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Saggin like a motherfucker khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover

Now as ya groove to the beat, and ya move to the sound

Peace...
Gz up, Hoes Down
