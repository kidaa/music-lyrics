Niggas, get your milla genuine draft, cause its milla time, we about to go hard on these hoes on
this one right here.

[Chorus]
[soopafly] Can you control your hoe? You got a bitch that wont do what you say
You cant control your hoe? She hardheaded, she just wont obey
Can you control your hoe? Youve got to know what to do, and what to say
Youve got to put that bitch in her place, even if its slapping her in her face.
Ya got to control your hoe. Can you control your hoe? 

I went to your house; your girl came in and started cussing you out. You should have slapped her
in her face, I wanted to tell you, but it wasnt my place. I kept it on the low, cause I know you
was gonna check that hoe. But instead, you was quiet as a mouse, maybe you started to think it
wasnt your house. Cause she was acting like a nut, you got a kind of bitch that would kick your
butt. What kind of pimp holds back? Never met a bitch that a pimp cant slap, whats wrong with
the pimpin? Why you get a whippin? All I got to say is this:

[Chorus]

[Verse: 2]
This is what you made me do; I really didnt want to put hands on you. But bitch you playin
with fire, i'm so sick and tired, of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips
on you, cause bitch you playin with fire, i'm so sick and tired. 

This is what you forced me to do, I really didnt want to put hands on you, but bitch you
playin with fire, i'm so sick and tired. Of bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on
you, bitch you playin with fire, Im so sick and tired.  

[Chorus]
No: can you control your hoe? At the end.
