I got a penthouse in Manhattan 
Two more in Malibu 
I bought an 87 Cadillac Seville 
I got a Maserati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers 
A couple on my toes,
I wear the finest cologne money can buy
It keeps me smellin like a rose
If u wonderin how I do it
Theres just one simple rule...Im just cool cool
Honey baby cant you see...Im just cool cool 
Aint nobody bad like me
whats that spell? C-O-O-L

I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin place I want to
And my lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozen
I got money by the ton
Just aint nobody better 
Heaven knows that Im the one
Its all because of something
That I didnt learn in school,

Honey baby cant you see...Im soo cool cool 
Aint nobody bad like me
