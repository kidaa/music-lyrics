[Jermaine Dupri] 
Uhh, whatchu wanna do?  SoSoDef 
You wanna get down? ah get down, get down 
Whatchu wanna do? ah get down, get down 
Said you wanna get down? We got Snoop Dogg, in the house tonight 
Whatchu wanna do? with the homeboy JD 
You wanna get down? ah get down, get down 
Whatchu wanna do? ahh ha ha 
Yeah, now check this out 

Now, everywhere I go 
they wanna see Don-Che-Che-O 
Yes obsessed with SoSo all my dough 
How the jewelry glow and the Cristi' flow 
Ain't no secret I sleep with freaky 
premium bush when I push they push 
And after we push I leave her 
Cause I don't love her 

[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Ha ha, and me neither 
A-B-C-D-P-G-C 
Who could it be, it's the D-O-double-G 
Known for the bone and the chrome on the D's 
Gold credit card backyard full of green trees what? 
Breeze through the summer in a Hummer wit tint 
Or dip in the low-low but that's just for promo 
Never leave me alone, without the dough doe 
I'm SoSo cold but y'all didn't know doe 

Chorus: Jermaine Dupri 

Whatchu wanna do?  Said you wanna get down? repeat 4X 
        3X: singer starts singing "get down on it" 2X 
            and Snoop says 'we have Snoop Dogg in the house tonight 
                            with the homeboy JD' 
        4X: singers sings "get down on it, cause we just wanna party with you" 
            and Snoop says 'ah get down, since you wanna get down' 

[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
To be a high roller, you need a pistola 
And about a half a key of some Coca-Cola 
Now that I got older, I got a little colder 
And I don't trip to get a chip off my [nigga's] shoulder 
Mad dreams, of a gangsta being like Cagney 
or Bogey but Snoop Doggy 
Ain't no follower, man I'ma General 
So when I put it down I gots to be so original 
I'm quick to bust just like Daz Dillinger 
But that's the little homey and I'm the big homey Snoop Don Corleone 
Spittin it, hittin it, while I'm gettin that 
Bout it, bout it, and happy to shout out, mmm 
I dissapear 'fore the game get crowded 
Take a trip overseas to the West Indies, freeze 
JD uh-huh, music please 

[Jermaine Dupri] 
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps 
So fat, call me Professor Clump 
Ain't nuttin on the low about me I floss 
And no there's none of these [hoes] son what I toss 
On the track better bring chips cause I cost 
Million dollar company [fuck it] I'm the boss 
I don't sit back and watch I go for it 
Different colored drops on the car port, who's short? 

Chorus 

[Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Khakis on my leg, Lugz on my feet 
I'm walkin up the street while boppin my feet 
I'm fresh off the bus from Memphis, Tennessee 
Head still spinnin from the Coke and Hennesee 
Sit down on it, nah, get down on it 
It really don't matter cause you want it, Dogg-gonit 
Cuz, you must was buzzed 
When you was bumpin your gums, who you thought I was? 
But look, I ain't even trippin right now 
It's like that there, bow, wow 
So many styles I could flip em like a file 
Pop my drop top and let the beat rock 
Dip through, course you do, miss you 
But back to the issue, I wish you 
stop tryin to clown the Pid-ound 
Cause you don't really wanna get down 

Chorus 

[singer] 
All we wanna do is make you dance 
No standing on the wall 
[JD] Get your back up off the wall, c'mon 
All we wanna do is make you dance 
No standing on the wall 
[JD] Get your back up off the wall 
Cause I heard all my [niggaz say 
You know it 
[JD] Uh-huh 
When your dancing yeah 
[JD] That's right 
You show it 
[JD] Uh-huh 
When you move move move 
[JD] Yeah 
You know it 
[JD] Do you wanna dance? Come with me and dance 
When your dancing yeah 
You show it 
[JD] Do you wanna move?  I'ma make you move 
When you move move move 
[JD] Come with me, yeah yeah, we gon let the beat go on like this 
     Do I wanna dance?  I'ma make your dance 
     Do y'all wanna move?  I'ma make you move...
