*helicopter flying overhead* 
This is Angela Sanders coming to you live 
from the scene of yet another murder mystery 
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered 
We have no information at this time 
*journalist speaks in spanish I won't be insulting and try to transcribe it* 
*lightning cracks* 
*helicopter passes by again* 

As I look up, at the sky 
My mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye 
My body temperature falls 
I'm shakin, and they breakin, tryin to save the Dogg 
Pumpin on my chest and I'm screamin 
I stop breathin, damn I see deamons 
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me 
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby 
I think it's too late for prayin, hold up 
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin 
  "Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better" 
And how long will I live? 
  "Eternal life and forever" 
And will I be, the G that I was? 
  "I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of 
   So relax your soul, let me take control 
   Close your eyes my son" 
My eyes are closed 

Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me" repeat 4X 

I'm fresh up out my coma 
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner 
It's gonna take a miracle they say 
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway 
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet 
And everything that nigga said, came to reality 
Livin like a baller loc 
I'm havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke 
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag 
And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad 
  "Just remember who changed your mind 
   Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass is mine" 
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed 
Never have a want, never have a need 
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo' 
Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe check it out 

        Now I lay me down to sleep 
        I pray the lord, my soul to keep 
        If I should die, before I wake 
        I pray the lord, my soul to take 

Murder was the case that they gave me 
        "Murder was the case that they gave me" repeat 2X 

No more indo, gin and juice 
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose 
Shackled from head to toe 
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know 
them niggaz from the other side recognize my face 
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C 
Mad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care 
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair 
Niggaz stare as I enter the center 
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay 
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor 
Niggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off 
Cause you can't tell what's next 
My little homey Baby Boo he took a pencil in his neck 
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two 
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo 

Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me" repeat 4X
