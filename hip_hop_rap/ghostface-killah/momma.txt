[Intro: Ghostface]
Damn, this is for all my women thats been going through the struggle
On welfare, living the rough life
It's gone be alright
Thats right
This is how we gone do it
I want you to explain your story
Then I'mah tell you mine
Tell 'em

[Chorus: Megan Rochell]
Hustlin, strivin, strugglin survivin Momma, momma
Never realizing, that you were a diamond momma, momma
Through the sun, or the rain, through the pain I'ma hold you down hold you down
Through the good, or the bad times I got love for you
The stress and the heart aches so much love for you

[Ghostface]
It's not ya momma fault
It's ya fathers fault
It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic
Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain
And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain
she Lost her first child in 74
And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw
she can't take it she constantly cryin fallin down on her knees
like help me lord please I'm ready to leave
all she needed was somebody to rub her feet
give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets

[Chorus]

[Ghostface]
I been sent by an angel to snatch you up
Take you way above the clouds and back you up
At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin
Don status in the sheets I'm keepin you warm
aint no nigga gone do what I do
imah take care of you and ya kids
Take the bent and go handle ya biz
The bills is paid,the cable back on
I quote you know the seeds want they nickleodeon on
I'm not ashamed to sport you
Floss you or gloss you out
Fat, skinny out of shape i'll dior you out

[Chorus]

[Ghostface]
In the hood theres a struggle
my girls is in trouble
she lackin guidance in the mind shes blinded and puzzled
her pops never showed her the ropes
her moms raised mad kids on her own
She never had a strong man in her home

[Meagan Rochell]
Nothing in this life, sun don't always shine
But it can't rain all the time everything gone be alright
Somebody sees your pain
You will never hurt again
I see you momma
I see you momma
You can cry yours eyes cry your eyes
It will be alright it will be alright

[Chorus]
