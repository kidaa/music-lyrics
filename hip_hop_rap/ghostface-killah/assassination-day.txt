[Raekwon:] What Hey yo!

[Intro: from the motion picture "The Usual Suspects"]

There's no coke!
What
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke!
What the fuck do you mean, there's no coke
I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fuckin room!
There's gotta be coke!
There is nothing!  NOTHING!

Huh, uh, uh, help please!
Huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, help me! *gunshot*

[Intro Two: Masta Killa]

It's assassi, it's assination day, I stalk...
It's assassination, I sta...
It's assassination day... 
It's assassination day, I

[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]
Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action

[Verse Two: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]
Assassination day
First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon
Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

[Verse Four: Masta Killa]
War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 
Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...

It's assassination day, I
It's assassination day
It's assassination day
It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy
It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy
