"I want you, you've got me, something soothing" [x4]

[Killa Sin]
The fuck
Yo, somebody sent their wolf pack and in clappin' rounds
Actin' like, what a way to play these clowns
Shady towns, guerillas tryin' to lay me down
Yo Lady Brown, I'll set it up, who give a fuck
We vested up from head to gut, them niggas won't get the best of us
The talk to me, silently they stalk with me
Armed to the titles, should've seen me
And let us out of these sheets, believe 'em, leave 'em
Coughin' and bleedin', even barfin' and wheezin'
Son they called for a year at Oz and we gon' make it even
+Burning Season+, Lord, keep all prawn on the head, Lord
The more beef they bring Killa, the mark steak to grease off
One shot nearly took a cheek off, should've seen him leapin'
and dancin', had all intention to smack him and jack him like Jackie lease, son
Bloody Wu Dons, _Episode 1_, Wu weapons get spun
And those who gamble with them hammers'll surely step up to come

"Get over here woman!"

[Interlude: RZA]
Yo, nigga, pass the mothafuckin' velvety, nigga
No more mothafuckin' velvety
What the fuck is that Grey Goose, nigga
Yeah, yo
Yo, where the fuck is Tony at, man
He in the room right here
True, so chill son, chill son
He gettin' his dick sucked
A bitch suckin' his dick
Not again, B Damn, nigga
Yo, Tony! Yo baby, chill, chill
Yo, hold up A bitch suckin' his dick
Oh shit, son, she slurpin' and burpin'
Fuck that Listen, listen, listen, listen
Oh shit he gettin' his dick sucked

[Ghostface Killah]
Five and a half in Boys, ass is off the hook
High school pussy, heard you got the best nookie
Sugar walls, watch and love, slide right on my dick
Gon' palm on ya ass like this while you ridin' it
I'm about to cum boo-boo, chill for a sec
Feel it at the tip, ma', ya pussy's too wet
One false move and I'ma blast like the very first time
Burnt you with candle wax fast while you was slobbin' mine
Dick is sensitive, you move, baby here it is
Oh Lord, that's what you look to move, you dumb broad
Comin' for days, wettin' ya cage
My dick is like the sprinklers and maybe ya dush, I'm here to save the day
Solomon was wise and I got fifty other bitches
Some eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas
Solomon was wise and I got fifty other bitches
Some eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas
