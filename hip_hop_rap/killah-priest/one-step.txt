[Killah Priest]
Early natives related to throwns of David
captured by some patriots, and thrown on slave ships
they stripped us naked, while they wives picked they favourite
lives were wasted, in the hands of the hated
driven from the garden [garden], now we starvin' in the martyring Sodom
they call it Harlem, wordly problems got us at the bottom
the Earth crisis, and the righteous grab their ice picks
seekers like us for our rices, I stay in ciphers
our live is, connected to second son of Isaacs, which had a tight grip
on the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother
the elders who served the younger, words heard in thunder
down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger, now it's cold in summer
to slow your slumbers, behold a number, 600, 6 and 3 score
the same as he saw, who ate his heat raw, in the time before
they climbed aboard a dinosaur, information held behind the doors
we came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here
then they gave us crack and beer, in the back of the stairs
please adapt your ears, add or subtract the years, and form the unwise
and watch the sunrise from sunset, none-slep, one flesh, one breath..
[Chorus: Hell Razah, Tekitha]
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
Your arms too short to box with god...
[Killah Priest]
Devils morale, they caught us playing with the gold marbles
we wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle, before the devil sold me
to the unholy, because my father told me
I lived like a monks of lowly, lowly, but lowly?
the president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti
slaughtered babies from the waters of Euphrates
maybe they send germs that polluted our sperm
and made us live with circumcize in the serpent eyes
and told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies
but in the halls of Farrow the walls are narrow
and religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom
now free them, lets feed um', feed um'...
they took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica
promised us 40 achers and a mule, treated like an animal
understand the jewel, brought to the 50 states
deuteronomy 28, verse 68, it all relates, 1555 is when we first arrived
we tell jokes wish um' get high, and watch the fish fry...
[Chorus]
[Outro: Tekitha]
One Step...
One, One, Step, Step
One, One, Flesh
One, One, Step..
One, One, Breath...
One.. Step....
One... Step...
