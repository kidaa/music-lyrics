Mystic City
=Unknown, maybe Kavalier= =Killah Priest=
I've found a star, [what's deal god, I heard you got some]
I've found a star, [bad news about Killah Priest, ya know]
I've found a star, [out here, right now it's madness, ]
where do we go from here, [things going on, word, shooting up, ]
after the storm is clear, [lotta cops, ya know what I'm sayin, ]

It's the end of the road, It's like the red moon,
over Tibet, theory of the 12 monkeys, left in this cold war hungry,
we kill over blood money, the cops seem to think it's funny,
we murder over pennys and crumbs, plenty of guns,
crammed in the city slums, the man pity none,
for this next millenium, kids starving when they breath,
you can see they kidneys and lungs, they left blind, skinny and dum,
sights far from a pretty one, praying to god, when will he come,
but half of my crew is atheists,
while the other halfs waiting on a spaceship, I can't take it,
screaming life is what you make it, so called fake-friends,
they all snakes in the end, trying to hide they face,
try to blend one mistake, I see them grin,
they say we of the same kin, cuz we have the same skin,
I live amongst the unholy, we all role weed, thick as Jamaican rollies,
until the lords scold me, and told me, you'll be my next Moses,
go sake the hopeless and homeless, with eviction notice,
arrive like the infant Joseph, with a grudge to Ceasar,
like the blood of Jesus, I told the Judge they don't love us,
we don't love um' either, 
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer,
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer,
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer,
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer..

where do we go from here, [where do we go from here]
after the storm has cleared, [after that storm has cleared]
where do we go from here, [like nights over Tibet]
after the storm has cleared..

my home is where the physco rage, spending long nights and cold days,
inside a bible cage, is it the curse of a bible plague,
welcome, to the cyber age, the air's burning like a microwave,
the holy lands sees miles away, I pour out some alisae, beneath the skies,
cuz the clouds are grey, ? piles of graves of the older slaves,
reptiles araise, from out the caves they invade,
the dirt under my nails got a story to tell,
I wrestle with angels like Michael L, spending nights in Jail,
beneath the hells dungeon, with the drunkest tounge kids,
we all haunted and unwanted, forgotten city,
where the air stays hot and misty, I see crack fiends with rotten titties,
twist the top off a whisky, east the block is risky,
that's why my shots empty, till the cops come and get me,
I stay in green camoflage, I see camels on mars,
already stars, scanning are cars, world famine at large,
they got us trapped like Shadrack and Mischaak and the Abednego,
I'm looking for the city of gold, I pity the soul,
that take humans, and start branding them like food cans,
it's like the 6 points of the hexagram,
resembles the sex of man, all my children in Bethlehem, 
I dropped the tek out my hand, dropped to the earth,
caresed the sand, yes I understand now, I heard a voice say,
come hither, I walk while others slither, lead me to my fathers river..
