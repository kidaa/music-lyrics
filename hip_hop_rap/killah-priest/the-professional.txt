[Killah Priest]
In hip-hop I'm a pro-fessional
no questions asked, better check my jewels
from 98 to 2G's, I rule
Killah Priest The Professional..
I build lyrics like a monument
most dominant, I drop bombs with common sense
the inipatant scientist, a perfectionist
a lyrical specialist..
most affectionate, most merciful
towards a fool, a thirst for jewels, you know the rules
migrates, beats efficient, holy as a baby Krishnan
pure as the river ?
once the words are spoken, heavens open
blow the smoke off the graphics
rub the tablet, kissed the Earth, I inhabit
cuz the bastards, that been grafted
through his maggots
I rocked the lord's silk fabrics
I rest on the holy Sabbath
I have a warrant, for all devils laying dormant
I arrive to cause torment, dark heavens, begins forming
start brain-storming, invite you in my office
my face begin to metamorphous, I go from gorgeous
into a fucking tyrannosaurus, scenery is now prehistoric
I'm kicking deadly rhymes with no chorus
lyrics hovers like flying saucers
niggas turning to alcoholics, staring up into orbit
showing all teeth like a walrus, began running through the forest
lyrics coming with deadly forces..
In hip-hop I'm a pro-fessional
no questions asked, better check my jewels
from 98 to 2G's, I rule
Killah Priest The Professional..

Killah Priest The Professional..
The greatest lyricist known to man, or mankind
stage host or landmine, come and heal before this ?
drop a freestyle until I'm old and se-nile
killings have a brother in the P now, I'm a murderer
to a lyrical burglar, I hit um' in the jugular
I snuff ya, handcuff ya, then I smother ya
I battle rappers by the billions
I battle old folks and small children
soldiers and civilians, I take on states and countries
I stay hungry, a predator, I bring it to ya on the regular
I give you static like a cellular with dead batteries
fuck up ya head like a cavity..
In hip-hop I'm a pro-fessional
no questions asked, better check my jewels
from 98 to 2G's, I rule

Killah Priest The Professional.. Y'all better learn
Killah Priest The Professional.. King Mu'tazila
Killah Priest The Professional.. Maccabees
Killah Priest The Professional..

[Outro to Heavy Mental, Movie Sample Begins]
I have written this for you my son, wherever you are
and for your children, and your children's children
it's a poor legacy, but it's all I have..
