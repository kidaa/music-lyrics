Intro: Child and Killah Priest
[Child] One two, one two
[Killah Priest] No doubt
[Child] The microphones on...
[Killah Priest] Cross my heart, hope to die
[Child] I've been waiting along time for this
[Killah Priest] Here we go Killah Priest, '97, '98....
[Killah Priest]
It's the byzantine king, supreme, all kneel kiss the ring
into a ilohean, I blow steam from the families of the mackabees
smack emcees watch them scream your majesty, make them suffer
the capacity of tragedy, hold the crowd down like gravity
back the fuck off, stop grabbing me, hands off me, niggas start to bore me
I'm getting sleepy, I need some coffee, me and my wu-bandits
we carry niggas deep in the canvas, body bandage, like some mummies
you fucking dummies, you can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited, the most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out KILLAH PRIEST, I leave the blood spilling in the street
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville, the seven shields on windmills
across the killing fields, never forget it, tell them rap critics
I speak in arithmics, so they can never get it, I'm too scientific
lyrics explicit, I roll with thirsty niggas, theifs and killers
tigers, gorillas, faces like godzilla
we stomp rappers and smile like a Calm-Della, we got iller
cross my heart both hope to die, we multiply, by the hundred
Fuckin by the thousand, see me outside your show browsin
Beatin up your soundman
playa haters and players, we give um' cold stares
any last prayers...
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, Yo, concrete techniques, bomb beats and cause casualities
my facalty, hold it down like gravity, rapidly
sweatin' like weapons to adolescence, ghetto residence
quick to pass since your present, state of the slum
kill 4 play the drums
face 1, their course was now, the snake tounge, I'm deep into this
I sometimes gasp for air, deadly warfare
hot block cop and gold stares, shots clear
Like fireworks on July the 4th, weapons get torn, fugitive slidin off
my force is combined, new world, 2009
Digital, criminals, we make mills in cyber-crime
It's all planned ahead, 2 times
I see the chimes through a great mind
The heaviest chain could not bind
Chorus, Killah Priest
We stare you eye to eye
We tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die.. hope to die..
[Genius/GZA]
High ranked officials and armed tanks with missles, blood drizzle
Simple fact, you slept on the issue, that before you started jerkin
Joysticks and segas, I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
to fine tune it, ship enough units
Emcees ask, who be those rhyme killers in mask
No doubt, difficult task, the last in the square, beware
Infinite amount of darts is in the air, I'm victorious
With no opponents, I blast through components, with microphonics
Watch the whole world live the moment, anything in time
Became approaching this, are incompable of speech, remains motionless
Chorus 2X
Hope to die..
