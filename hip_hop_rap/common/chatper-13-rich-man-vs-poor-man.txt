Let's talk about money
	Ynot get the money
	Common Sense want the money
	Let's talk about money

[Common Sense]
I... be... the one they call Petey
I'm Poe, as Edgar Allen
But I'm a poet when I'm freestylin

[Ynot]
Egad it is I, master Ynot Never The Less
Fresh like air, well dressed, yes the LS's here
I appear on piers with my peers
The Imperial like margerin, I'm butter 
Yes, fly like my Lear, I jet

[Common Sense]
Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time
It's time for some perculator
I circulate around the block black
So give me a six-pack and a half of Harold's Chicken
A good combination
When I get bubbly, I do it in moderation
One brew, one brew, I said one brew at a time

[Ynot]
Well I'm a two timer of women that are three times a lady
May Sadie say Sade and may Ms. Goldberg say
 quot;Yo Whoopie, there it is. quot;
Call me E cause I equal MC squared
In the Biz, Marks know I got the Kie, to get the girl's noses
open like  quot;The Vapors quot;, more pub than the papers
More papers than the press, oh yes I gets paid

[Common Sense]
Yes, check it
I didn't grow grow up up po' po' 
but once you get grown, and out on your own
Bills upon bills upon bills is what you have
Before you get your check then you already spend half
See I make money, money doesn't make me
I'm a reflection of my section and my section 8

[Ynot]
Enough
I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls
to have them comin' in ohhh yes 8 seconds
I told Victoria her Secret you suck, like Sucrets
I Ultrawhite my secretery, I went to Tibet
to bet on my horse you bet your life
Mine was better and now your deader
than a door knob eeea wrong

[Ynot]	So what's your name
[Comm]	I'm the Com, the bro Com Sense
	And when I don't got scratch, I do feel tense
	And if you givin your papers to a broad youse a dummy
[Ynot]	Cause without no money
	 quot;Ain't a damn thing funny quot; scratched 3X

[Ynot]
Rhymes I exchange like stock, I'm live like stock
I rock like Prudential, making ha ha from O
That's mucho dinero, like Robert Deniro,
I rob-berts Deniro, a hero like the sandwich
A Man-wich has mills like Stephanie Mills, dills like pickles, 
I'm fancy man I tickles LIKE the French
Not Johnny but like a Bench I Press-On like Lee
I Stan like Lee, while you Stagger like Lee
Most likely I'll gagger that bullish I pull ish like a magnet
or dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income
Yo bums I rush like adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush'll get mushed 
like a sleigh dog; I slay dogs who are under me
I'm over man, call me Doberman, cause I'm a Pinscher of pennies
that's pretty, leave your city green from all the money I spent
What you do I stay fresh like a mint from mint
I meant my mint, know what I mean I'm nice
Real friendly like an Officer, Friendly and a gentleman
Friendly like Neighbors, not Jim 
but like Gomer I got Pyle's of loot
Attention salute - I kill loot but won't dilute
Even if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute
Man, I'm too rich for that, biiitch!

	Ynot got the money

[Comm]	So what's your name
[Ynot]	I'm Ynot I own a mansion and a yacht uh-huh

[Common]
Ynot.. let me tell ya a story
Okay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man
The black man of course he was po' yeah
The white man... he was rich uh-huh
And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' aight c'mon
Okay the black man lived on Beat Street
The white man lived on Wall Street 
and at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot 
cause the white man kept steppin on the black man's toes damn!
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care;
shit, he didn't have to wear it uh uh
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents;
with his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
but at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
cause wasn't nobody feedin him and feedin him
And took red by his neck and started beatin him and beatin him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store 
and the name of it is Leon's what's that
Barbeque that is..
Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken

[Comm]	So what's your name
