Verse One:

I'm {easy} easy, easy like Sunday morning
I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning
Ahhh, Common's comin with that old oh excuse me
Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a dewe-dewe
Doogie, Howser, cause see I'm like Bowser
Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt, and the
trousers, how's the, Family Ties
I'm left with the gift, open it up, SUPRISE!
Big bat, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder french fries
Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaies and apple pies
And a cup  Nah, that's enough of that
I'm like an indian giver, yo, give me that back
Comin again hip-pop-pop-pop bring it back selector
We be the thoroughbred, so use your head, play the Trifecta
Common infector, smug MC, heads up!
Ya better duck cause muck-a-luck, it's me
[Now what's your name] Common
Come in again... Common
[How would you do it] Common
[Now how was she] Common, check it out!
Common is coming soon to a theater near you
To the U-A-C crew, nuff respect due
Do I do, where I do, when I do
I do do do, yo I do it on the ease

Verse Two:

I be kickin it with the doubly-dope rhymer
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sli-mer
[Who ya gonna call] Ghostbuster
I'm pee-wee we stole, and I'm just a
Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec
But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check
So I checked myself, before self got buck
wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a snake, and metriculate, yo I had to elevate
You can tell it's great, cause I'm state
of 87, the South side of Chicago
Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go
And I know I ain't did nuthin [hell naw]
The district think I be just a lil trick kid frontin
U Ak got my back if there's any contact
In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat
And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight
I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State
And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia
Holy-molia, it's totally awesome
The survey say, I gets moe skins than Richard Dawson
But I won't catch mono or no type of disease
Cause when I flex, for sex, I do it on the ease

Verse Three:

A lop bop a woo bop, a lop bam boogie
I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper 
two-steppin through, yodel-le-hee-hoo!
Oui oui mon cheri, a como tale vouz
[Contraire mon frere] OK, to the death
Is it true that I'm dope {Yeahhhh!}
Yippedy yes y'all, here we go a loopedy loop de loo
A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop
I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker
I'm shakin-and-bakin-and-takin, cause I'm the back-board
break her arm and feather, whippin the wonder when she activates
Hold up!  My jaws are in my crack, [aight] pass the tape
Time to activate, and ejaculate
This is the beauty of where I'm in a state
I meant to say demonstrate
I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball
In the corner pocket, count em, buck it
A chicken, a finger-lickin with a finger-bone
C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll
Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll
of Khomein, my domain is infinite
Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick
and to the hip-hop shop, the future shock
When we started kickin on the one two, and ya don't stop      
But the buck stops here buckaroo
Ya got your instructions, now you know what to do
Take it easy
