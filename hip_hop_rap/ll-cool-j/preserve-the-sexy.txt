LL 
Teairra Mari 

[LL Cool J:] 
You seem like a type 
That wanna do a couple things 
When I look in your eyes 
I can tell you ready to swing 

[Teairra Mari:] 
Slow down baby 
I'm waitin more than a fling 
And I'm up on the game 
That you own G-screen 

[LL Cool J:] 
Damn it's like that 
Cryin logical attacks 
Your talkin really breezy 
Easy that's crap 

[Teairra Mari:] You need to fall back 
[LL Cool J:] What you sayin I'm a wreck 
[Teairra Mari:] Teairra ain't a trick 
I ain't with all that 

[LL Cool J:] 
Now, see you talkin real ball 
Your vibes is real cold 
You better smarten up 
Slide in the rolls 

[Teairra Mari:] 
I'm not the next chick 
You can hit the exit 
Everything you sayin 
It's just what I expected 

[LL Cool J:] 
Parts are projected 
Many more are you collected 
Life is a movie 
I'm just tryna direct 
You know like I know 
You do wanna stay connected 
Hit you to the rules of the game 
Shorty check it 

[Chorus:] 
[LL Cool J:] Chain on my neck 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] The 0's in the check 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] Crib and the whips 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] Cash, the chips 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] The honey on my arm 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] The ice and the charm 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] Teairra Mari 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[LL Cool J:] Your man L on this beat 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 

[LL Cool J:] 
You really should let me 
Keep you in this epy 
Straight E-bees, H-bendels, Chanell 
This is L 

[Teairra Mari:] You doin a lot of frontin 
[LL Cool J:] But that ain't hard to tell 
[Teairra Mari:] You tryna flip me 
[LL Cool J:] Naw B 
[Teairra Mari:] That's T 

[LL Cool J:] 
Aha, we'll see 
Spend a little time with me 
By the time I make a move 
You'll be sayin finally 

[Teairra Mari:] Ain't no moves to be made 
[LL Cool J:] Too many games get played 
[Teairra Mari:] Too many chickens get layed 
And watch their record say she's tained 
[LL Cool J:] Where you from 
[Teairra Mari:] Detroit 
[LL Cool J:] What that mean 
[Teairra Mari:] I'mma point 

[LL Cool J:] 
Relax, we talkin 
Don't get your draws out of joint 
I wanna see you smile 
Elevate your life style 
Cop a yacht 
Hit the south the French 

[Teairra Mari:] 
Not a chance 

[LL Cool J:] 
Keep your little advance 
This one's on me 
In the chef's a boar 
You can eat for free 

[Teairra Mari:] 
Slow down sweetie 
My waist is 24 
I'm far from greedy 

[LL Cool J:] 
You gonna love it believe me 

[Chorus] 

[LL Cool J:] 
Back sippin Venome S 
Spillin it all my leanin 
My baby's smooth leather 
It' softer than most women 
Everything is crist 
From my cuff to the trimmin 
Words can't describe 
All the gummers that I've been in 

[Teairra Mari:] 
I've been half caught in yes 
Which whips every day 
My lil jack Russell 
Knows how to hustle 
I stay with canary's on 
Platinum on every song 
Hate it or love it 
Them respect how I does it 

[LL Cool J:] 
Well I'm not them 
That's how I got gems 
Cost a quarter million Dollars 
For Don ? rims 
Understand me Slim 
That's how the game begin 
If he was me, then he do the same to him 
But L's the real deal 
So tell me how you feel 
Tell me one of your secrets 
I keep my lips sealed 

[Teairra Mari:] 
That's for me to know 
And you to find out 

[LL Cool J:] 
Long as we both now 
What we talkin bout 

[Chorus] 

[LL Cool J:] What you wanna do 
[Teairra Mari:] Preserve the sexy 
[Till the end]
