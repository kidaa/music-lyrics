[Intro]
I just wanna make sweet love to you, baby, you know what Im saying?
I just wanna touch you all over aw, please!

[Hook: Fatman Scoop & LL Cool J]
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Aint no problem, Im on it  oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
Its just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now Im hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasnt callin me back, they was callin me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
Im too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help em mind they business with some bottles on ice

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x8]
Destruction in the club

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Oh, no Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes itll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin, peepin
The bitches is dippin, dippin
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
Its the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
We aint flirtin, we talkin  we aint dancin, we walkin
Teenagers is pointin, couple cougars are hawkin
I dont come here that often, but its totally awesome
When you livin for real, I dont consider it flossin
Panty lines are crossin, Im proceedin with caution
I dont shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, Im like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone  Kool Aid smile on my face
My securitys strapped, aint no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I cant believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, theyre so sick of me rapping
Im enjoying your blog, Ive got the same type of passion

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x4: Fatman Scoop & LL Cool J]
Fatman Scoop, Maserati Cool J
They aint think I can do it, thats why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and its Buicks
Since the beginning, I knew it  rollin an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it, thats how a legend should do it

[Hook x2]
