[Rap:]
Concentrate, listen to me,
while you do me, Should I surrender when you persue me,
You think a man don't have heart and soul,
When a hand's that good, anybody will fold,
It's like poetry in motion,
But the heart regulates the devotion,
Love is floatin' in a sky blue ocean,
Think about it, Feel the motion, young queen, it reminds me of a smoothed 
out movie scene,
Two bodies intertwined on the screen, Everybody make love in their dreams,
But this is real, know what I mean
Passion is the way of the world, Electricity when boy meets girl,
And making love is the key, A burning flame that will last eternally

[Verse 1:]
You should know that I'm here for you, 
As long as you see me through,
I would give all I have just to be with you,
Don't you see honey it could be me and you.

[Chorus]
I really look forward to being with you,
When you're not around I don't know what to do,
You give me a feeling that I can't control,
You take my heart and soul
Never Question what I do,
Cause you need me baby and I need you,
so there's no need for ya to have no fears,
Without a doubt I will be here,

[Verse 2:]
Now I know what I want to do,
Everything is all right as long as I'm with you,
Oh don't you understand I don't want to be alone,
Baby don't you know:

[Chorus:]
I really look forward to being with you,
When you're not around I don't know what to do,
You give me a feeling that I can't control,
You take my heart and soul,
Never question what I do, 
Cause you need me and I need you,
So there's no need for ya to have no fears,
Without doubt I will be here.
