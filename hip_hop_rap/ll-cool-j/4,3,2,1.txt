look up but fuck ugly 
techna jaw from a punch buggy 
sunnin' you 
got you shittin' in your last  
runnin' who 
fucking punk 
hit a speed bump coming through 
a single shot make you meet love respect Wu 

[Redman] 
aiyo I put it on a nigga 
shit it on a nigga 
turn a chrsitian to a certified sinner 
the bomb I release time  explodes 
while you got sit up I was hittin' your ex hoe 
shit I kept low petro your metro 
politics keep the chicken heads gobolin' 
shit I'm drivin' in come with full polygin 
terrorize your city from the spliff committee 
kick ass till both timberlands turn shitty 
gritty smack the drivers head in the gypsy 
when I approach rappers be takin' notes 
drop like I shoulda invented the rain coat 
absolute I love to burn to the root 
I keep coming till your pour sperm from your boots 
vigilante hardcore to the penis 
tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic 

[Canibus] 
I'm the illest nigga alive watch me prove it 
I snatch a crown with your head still attatched to it 
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics 
beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life 
when you look at me long enough I start to read your thoughts 
if the signal is strong enough and then I'll call your bluff 
like yo how many rhymes you got 
I will go for more milleniums than mazda's got on the car lot 
and there's no where to run ta when I confront ya 
nigga I call your bluff like you had a phone numba 
who wanna see Cannibus get wild 
who wanna act wild get shot down with a surface to air missile 
I take 'em on in all shapes sizes and forms 
and spit on anybody who ain't close enough to shit on 
zero to sixty I'm already doing a hundred 
when I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it 

[DMX] 
stay out the dark 
cause if I catch you when the sun is down run it clown 
come up off that or I'm gon' gun it down 
run it now 
wherever stone goes it's gon' be there 
see that 
that shit'll finish you dawg 
beleive that 
where we at 
do your value your life as much as your possesions 
don't be a stupid nigga learn a lesson 
I'm gon' get you either way 
and it's better to live 
let me get what's in your sock because it's better to give 
than receive beleive what I say when I tell you 
don't make me put your somewhere were nobody can smell ya 
and when the lights is out they don't come back on 
this ain't a flick they ain't gon' come back on 
you ain't that strong 
you knew it was wrong 
but you asked for it baby 
you'se a pig nigga ski mask for it baby 
so I can hit you up on front teeth

you want deep leave 'em behind

[LL Cool J] 
my young son's fantasize of borrowing flows 
tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed 
this symbol on my arm is off limit to challengers 
you hold and bust the swords I swing the excalliber 
how dare you step up in my deminsion 
your little ass should be somewher cryin' on detention 
watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue 
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun 
blow you to peceis leave you covered in feces 
with one thesies LL Cool J is hard 
every little boy wanna pick up the mic 
and try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype 
but that's like picking up a ball playin' with Mike 
swingin' at Ken Griffy or challenging Roy to a fight 
snappin' your ameteur MC's 
don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas 
for rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease 
ringmaster bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
in the history of rap they've never seen such prominence 
your nieve confidence gets crushed by my dominence 
now let's get back to this mic on my arm 
if it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb 
you don't wanna bar that you wanna idolize 
and you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize 
and I'm daring every MC in the game 
to play yourself out position and mention my name 
I make a rhyme for every sylabel in your name 
go platnumn for every time your grimy ass was on the train 
watch your mouth don't ever step out of line 
LL Cool J nigga greatest of all time
