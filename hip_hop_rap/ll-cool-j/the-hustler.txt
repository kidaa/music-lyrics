The streets got so many stories am told about the hustle
About the hustle, lets go
The streets have to be some people father and mother
Coming from the streets nobody want to hear your story
No no no no
Let me introduce you to the streets faded glory

The hustle, oh yeah
The hustle, oh yeah
The hustle, oh yeah
The hustle

[LL Cool J:]
Im the real McCoy
Ive got games for these baby boys
Like a pack we set these dudes on fire
Cause homie was a thief and a motherfucking liar
These choices lead the Rolls Royces
The 88 gates talking with different voices
From the block to the yard
Straight to the box where we sh*t on the guards
10 years in the same cell
Untold stories that we know so well
Rico running with the bibos
Streets makem motherfucking evil
Turn your best friend from the church
Kill his baby mother six blocks from his staple
The streets are lethal
Hold your head up
Your still my people

These streets aint loyal
These snakes will coil you
Right here for you, families separated water and oil
So special like Mavado
That flow so premium like Colorado
Standing in the mirror with his green eyes
Reminiscing about the day black justice died
Baking soda in the water
I got some change and a quarter
Yellow tops on the corner
Shits hotter than a sona
Got us in too deep
Wide open the streets dont sleep
Remy got a front row seet
But this aint a movie this is yours truly
