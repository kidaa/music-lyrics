[Intro]
Wooh
And you say New York City uhuh
Back by popular demand ah ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
You been waitin in the bay for us so long baby
We had em starvin
Ay yo E, the big homie

[Verse 1]
Star studded, my ear lobes is flooded
Djs wanna rub it, bootleggers wanna dub it
Easy does it
Ladies love it, cats with big budgets
We be gel two jets and Tar Smith luggage
Clowns talkin rubish and pretendin they thuggish
But Im a young livin legend like Pee Wee at the Ruckers uhuh
I was raised outta Queens
But rap kept me off of the cover of Feds magazine
Put me in a Gulf Stream
Your man done it, push the EX 100
And you dont want it, I got the whole rap game cornered
Watch me flaunt it, damn right Im iconic
Soon as Nix find an icy track I slide on it

[Hook]
I know theres got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
Im about to get her
And I know theres gotta some kind of chick up off in here thats got the hots for me
Im about to get her
See I know theres got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
Im about to get her
I know theres got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
Im about to get her

[Verse 2]
The beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake
The safe in the floor with a life time of cake
Wifey emailing, make my side vibrate
Cats cant believe Im still hot, I got em irate
The hip hop boss of the Empire State
Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
Hes the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
They platinum selling or, my skins turning gray 
Okay
They dont know how to act
And my BDS was miles ago to Cali and back
Minimum
Private jets in the millennium
Plenty of Benjamins, hot ladies and gentleman but I said and 

[Hook]
I know theres got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me

And I know theres gotta some kind of chick up off in here thats got the hots for me
Im about to get her
See I know theres got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
Im about to get her
I know theres got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
Im about to get her

[Verse 3]
I know that its ridiculous for yall to picture this
The way I keep reein up, servin and flippin this
Dot the Is cross the Ts meticulous
The coldest winter ever and Im so icicle-ish
The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
Theres no forgettin this, the way that Im reppin this
My bodyguards big but do that make me rebelish
Im in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
Thats why Im still a teen pop idol like Hanson
Young black and handsome, movin with the cheddar
Bring honey to the V.I.P., Im about to get her 
Lets go

[Hook]
I know theres got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
Im about to get her
And I know theres gotta some kind of chick up off in here thats got the hots for me
Im about to get her
See I know theres got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
Im about to get her
I know theres got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
Im about to get her
Uh, put your hands in the air
Yeah
Throw ya hands in the air [7x]

[Hook]
I know theres got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
