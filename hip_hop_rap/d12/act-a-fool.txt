[Proof]
Niggas bite what they cant be 
The rich throw what they cant eat 
Niggas you aint sweet 
Coughin and gaggin 
Often I'm braggin 
Got a big dick to stop my pants from saggin 
Waggin your tail like a fag in the jail 
Keep _on the fucker like weed bags in the mail 
Empty you vein like a sword to flesh 
You niggas rap about nothing like Lord Finess
This is bugz 

[Bugz]
Let me know 
You niggas was shoot or start a scrap 
You think they wanna shoot 
Ill put a bullet through they starter cap 
This a about every niggas that i beat up 
Stomped unconscience 
Smacked with tha heater 
Fuck you 
Bugz dont give a fuck about your feelings 
I blow your shit out like I gun hustle Simmons 
So hide your knot when you walkin up my block 
Niggas smack you with the glock 
And take the money out ya sock 

[2x]
Know to act a fool 
And wild out when we buzzin 
Always rumblin 
Roudy niggas dirty dozen 
Cold blooded but album hotter then a oven 
You want beef What niggas start sumtin 

[Proof]
Its Proof the total package 
You total wackness 
The fact is 
You need a life time of practice 
Im active bouce in the coupe 
To the _
Found the foutain of youth 
Mudon   is countin on Proof 
_ survival blaze _
Before armageddon snatched the prof 
Out the bible 
Kill a rival with the impact of a rifle 
And ring the blood out ya 
Before_ crypt and my disciple 


Man lemme tell what type a nigga I am 
Im the type of mutha fuckin that write rhymes that kill niggas 
Im the type of nigga that niggas cant fuck with 
You know what im sayin That what type of nigga I am 

[Bugz]
You the type write away gone write a million rhymes a day 
Come back around the way and sound the same ol entire way 
Bugz will grab a brew and drink a proof from Mary J 
And bust a freestyle that sounds better then yo tape 
You style is bitchy, I have a harder time with Missy 
Yo whole set up sucks like Monica Lewinsky 
I can cop a seed and read a dictonary first 
And kill you with a rap full of words 
I just learned! 

[Chorus]
