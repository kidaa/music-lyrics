D12, Kum ba yah

I've had a special request for.. 

I take a couple uppers, 
I down a couple downers,
but nothin' compares
til' those blue and yellow purple pills

I've been to mushroom mountain,
once or twice boy who's countin' 
but nothin' compares
to those purple yellow blue an pills

Cool, calm just like my mom 
With a couple of valiums inside her palms
