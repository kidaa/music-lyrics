Your Mother! 
You fuckin faggot 

There once was a man who liked to jump around 
But he got too old to jump up and down 
So he put down the mic and picked the guitar up 
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow 
Left his boys in the House Of Pain 
It was the wisest decision he ever made 

But the dumbest thing that he could ever do 
Is try to pump a 380 at those that act shady 
Tell me now what you gonna do 
Cuz i remember all those years 
How it was when you were here 
I remember how it was 
How it was when you were young 
Yesterday was so long ago 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along 
Now nobody wanna here your old ass sing no more 

I remember back when you had the knack 
And I remember when you had your first heart attack 
I was right there laughin when I heard the news 
I just wish the cardiac would have murderered you 
Maybe Ice-T is right you are a bitch 
You come around when your broke 
And leave when your rich 

But the dumbest thing that he could ever do 
Is try to pump a 380 at those who act shady 
Tell me now what you gonna do 
Cuz i remember all those years 
How it was when you were here 
I remember how it was 
How it was when you were young 
Yesterday was so long ago 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along 
Now nobody wanna here your old ass sing no more 

Remeber back in 94 like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford 
Before his heart attack had him on life support 
When House Of Pain was outta fame 
Like some one douced the flame 
And maybe they destined never to jump around again 
Or ever further back when I first had heard the knack 
And you were down with Syndicate 
I went to get your shit man I was into it 
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit 
Now you sound rediculous 
You dickless piece of shit how could you diss me bitch 
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude 
Remember Sway and Tech when came up and sat beside you 
Started rhymin then you left the room and didnt say goodbye or nuttin 
Like you mad cuz some one else is white and tryin rhyme or sumtin 
Im sorry man I wasnt tryin to steal your light or nuttin 
But your a homo sexual white rappin irish    
Man I wish I was irish then I could be a   too 
Then I'd be confused as you 
And I wouldnt know what to do 
Wuts up with you, I never fucked wit you 
Why would you fuck with me 
Knowing I could rap circles around you 
Wut you nutz as me ? 
Plus I could sing better then you and I dont fuckin sing 
And probably play guitar better and I aint never touched a string 
But I aint mad at you I'd hate me to if I was you 
Im what your used to be, shit you was me in 92 
So ever time I right a lyric Im a think of you 
And maybe that will help me know what its like to sing the blues 

Cuz i remember all those years 
How it was when you were here 
I remember how it was 
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along 
Now no one wanna here your old ass sing no more 

Fuckin faggot sissy, fuck 
And by the way 380's a fuckin sissy gun
