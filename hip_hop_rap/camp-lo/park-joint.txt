What a dream i had tonight
you were all dressed up in blue
It almost felt like we were tame
now i'm so sorry that i led you to believe

that it was you who made us fall apart
that it was you who put this sadness in my heart
when I should be the one to blame

What a dream it was this time
we were tangled up in blue
tonight the last touch is good bye
'cause i'm so sorry that I lead you to believe

that it was you who put this pain inside of me
who made me chain inside and see
that i should be the one to blame

you who made us fall apart
you who put this sadness in my heart
you should be the one to blame
