Down in Lou'siana where the black trees grow live a voodoo lady named Marie Lavaux
She got a black cat tooth and a mojo bone and anyone wouldn't leave her alone
She go GREEEEEEEEEEEE another man done gone

She live in a swamp in a hollow log with a one eyed snake and a three legged dog
She got a bent bony body and stringy hair and if she ever seen you messin' round there
She go GREEEEEEEEEEEE another man done gone

And then one night when the moon was black into the swamp came Handsome Jack
A no good man that you all know and he was lookin' around for Marie Lavaux

He said Marie Lavaux you lovely witch why don't you gimme a little charm gonna make me rich
He said now gimme million dollars and I'll tell you what I'll do, this very night I'm gonna marry you
It'll be GREEEEEEEEEEEE another man done gone

So Marie did some magic and she shook a little sand, she made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she looked and she said hey hey, Now I'm gettin' ready for my wedding day
But ol' Handsome Jack said  Good-bye Marie, you too damn ugly for a man like me
So Marie started cryin', her fangs started shakin', her body started turnin', she started quakin'
She said GREEEEEEEEEEEE another man done gone

So if you ever get down where the black tree grow and meet a voodoo lady named Marie Lavaux
And if she ever asks you to make her your wife, man you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it'll be GREEEEEEEEEEEE....
