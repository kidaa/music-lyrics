E                B     E  A   C#m            E       A       E
Love gets you twisted,        love gets you twisted all the way
The hearts are enlisted, the hearts are enlisted to break each day
G#m                          E
I try to straighten out but I'm too wrapped up to see
C#m      A    B
I don't know how it's supposed to be

Love gets you twisted Love gets you twisted inside out
I knew that it existed I knew that it existed I had no doubt
When she's in my arms I get tangled up it's true
I can't see the other point of view

A               E     C#m           F#

Love gets you twisted

Screw yourself up Screw yourself up
B           B               E

I try to straighten out but I'm tangled up it's true
I can't see the other point of view
Love gets you twisted Love gets you twisted Love gets you twisted
Screw yourself up Screw yourself up Screw yourself, screw yourself
