Thats Where I'm From
Thats Where I'm From

Back in the hub we used to drop madel
Contemplate in hell
The stories I could tell would
Freak your mind, and wreck your brain
The thoughts I would have 
would drive most insane
The band playin' Rain
Gettin' Down wit' Jimmy
Hendrix, and Page
Make up the rage
Back in the Huddle
McLou's back yard
Me and D was starvin'
And times were hard
Danny used to roll through
Schemin' on the hustle
Credit cards and slang
and M-MC bangin
Leathal used to come with his reel to reel
We didn't have no deal
But that wasn't the point, we'd 
Rock a funky joint
Then we'd rock another
The only thing to eat 
Was some bread, and peanut butter
Back to all the females that beded me
In case you ever wondered
They didn't forget me
These are the times that I always think of
And this is dedicated to the ones I love

[Chorus]
That's where I'm from
Where're you goin' if you don't look back
What's the use of havin ends
If you lose all your friends [x4]

Paintin on the wall
Ten years gone by
Playin on the stereo
With the volume kinda low
Scheme Team's comin'
Bring me along
We gonna throw a hut party 
Till' the break of dawn
With the Soul poppin, thats Soul Poetry
Chameleon playin bringin wit that team
Bring a tab and a 40 and a bag of weed
That's all I need G
Caue I aint Freaky
Trippin for days
Runnin the maze
Goin down to Venice
Sippin on the Guinness
These are the times that I always think of
And this is dedicated to the ones I love

[Chorus]

Now times have change
And I'm on tour
And I don't see my friend every day no more
And cause they dont see me
They think I've changed
But, I the same motherfucker no doubt
What's it all about
I thought we was people
I'm tryin to get mine
I thought you had my back
Man, I can't understand
They used to slap my hand
Ask me for a grand
And run wit your man
Behind my back and diss me
If you wanna fuck me
first ya gotta kiss me

[Chorus x3]
