Much love to my man Leone
Keep rockin' dem beats and gettin' parties on the floor
Much love for my man Danny Boy
Ever since you came in my life you helped bring me joy
Much love for my man Grand Mixer-Mugs
For taking me off the street and mixin' with the thugs
And much love love for my man B-Real
I'm glad you got bit to that steel
And much love for my man Sen Dog
The crews rolling thicker than some London fog
And much love for my man Steve Urkel
I trust him wit my life and with the loop from every show
And much love for my rudy named Justin
'Cause if anyone steps up I know you gonna bust 'em
And much love for my man Scott Ian
For bein' a really down to earth human bein'
And much love to my man Guy-O
'Cause every day of the week he's got another fine ho
And much love to my man Bronk Style
You came to my party and son, you made it worthwhile
And much love to my man Son Doobie
If I needed it again you'd sell the gun back to me
And much love to my man Ralph Emms and the Tomahawk Funkster
Funky like a dumpster
And much love to my men Kaves, ADMoney and the Edge
With family like Sister Sledge
And much love to my moms and my sister and my niece
And everyone out there fighting the beast
And much love to the pioneers
'Cause I'm gettin' pain for rhymin' and drinkin' beers
And much love to the ultra magnetic
'Cause everybody knows you never got enough credit
