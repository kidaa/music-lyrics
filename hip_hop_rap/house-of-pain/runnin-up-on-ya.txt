Runnin' Up on Ya
Runnin up on ya
The House of Pain...runnin' up on ya [2x]

Give me some elbow room
Spark the boom
Then pass it
I'll drop ya like acid
Ya might get blasted
If ya step to the crew with the Irish Pride
Ya wish ya died
Cause I don't let shit slide
Sinn Fein
Is the House of Pain
Our day will come
Boom she-lach-lach
My shit's cocked
Ya better run
Get a gun
Get a bomb
It's on like Vietnam
Then run and get ya momma
And ask why Daddy's buggin'
Chuggin' Black & Tan's
Smacking Fans
I'm breakin' up the set
I'm gettin' bitches wet
Gettin' all the dough
I'm leavin with ya ho
And if the ho's ya wife
Yo, ya might lose your life

Cause I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya

I'll rip out ya veins
With hooks and chains
Just like Pinhead
I used to rock a skinhead
Now I got a fade
Case I'm paid
And the bomb is played
Everybody's done it
So Ev can never run it
I started that shit two years ago
Your girl started lookin' good five beers ago
So I might step to her
But I just wanna' screw her
I don't want to take her
I just wanna' make her
Scream out my name
Cause the Pain's in the House
Bust a nut in her gut
And leave a stain in her blouse
Then pull up my drawers
And she's all yours again
And if ya got a beef punk
Better bring a friend
Cause I'm runnin' up on ya

I ain't gonna' warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm commin' 'round the corner
I ain't gonna' warn ya

I'm runnin' up on ya
Punk you're a goner
Put the gun away
Run away
Better chill
Better yet still
Let me get ill
I can drop a bomb
Full of semen in ya mom
And keep her screamin till dawn
Cause the E can rock on like a
One, two and ya don't stop
Ya might get dropped
Cause I don't
And I swear
I don't have a gun
I ain't gonna' when

Cause I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna warn ya
Runnin' up on ya
