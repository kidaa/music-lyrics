Yes yes ya'll
Cause I'm so fly
Everlast be the apple of your Earth's eye
I be breakin the laws, breakin the laws
All you wannabe hard rocks just pause
It's the MC host
Space ghost from the coast
With piggish white skin
Kid, where you been
I got a blue eye
But my tight lenght devil
I freak harmonies 
Like my brother is Nevel
And I can rock 
Through your style
Eatin cold hardy stew
So whachya wanna do
I'm comin real soon
To a theatre near you
So why dont you cratique me
While I'm love on stage
Cause I'm gonna break my
Rusty cage, my rusty cage
Watch the way I freak it
When I bust my gage
Cause all that loud gun talk
Dont mean squat 
If my tool gets hot
I'm a burst your knot
And give it all I got
Up in your wisdom slot
And cold and rains 
couldnt stop her
From callin me poppa
Big daady draw dropper
Mr.Heart breaker
She leaves Mary Poppins
And comes home Seka

[Chorus]

Yes yes ya'll 
Cause I'm so fly so fly
Everlast be the apple of your Earth's eye
Yes yes ya'll 
Cause we dont fake dont fake
And he's down to come to feel your earthquake

Socalize a little somethin'
And you sweatin my style
Challenge my world
You wanna shell my mix
You wanna sit with my flesh
And reconize the tesh
Ya never seen this niggers best
A marage, a nest
I hit your head with styles that are liquid
You drip this
Sweat this
Perspired is desired, this wetness
You get from Divine style
Spark this girl, chill
I see you got the love, the lust
So why dont you live my cosmos exodus
To my precous 
I'm a undress my message
Into my wisdom body
To my wisdom method
You need a star for your cresent
I got a diablo brass
For your atmosphere
My a dope mathamatics
Are soak like Insin-sincere
Uh, baby 
For my apparatus
I do justice to your physical
Annoint your aider
never spendin your nobler
A hard slyle at stages
While the guard be sparkin that indo seed
The Earth pieces be increasin
That need to be pleased
I represent the illest villans
And the worst of bad breeze
Ah baby, 
If you wanna next my vision
You better come with subject of vision
I keep it real live
Keep it real straight
To the Earthly
Feel this style Earthquake

[Chorus x 2]

My love's stronger than pride
My loves thicker than blood
My killer swarm's in effect
Nobodys livin off hud
If you miss with his gun
I'll run a patriot gig
I'll have you flippin your wing
I'll put the clip in my sink
And cock the hammer back
Click Clack
Put a hole in your back
The size of a plum
You can come git some
But my attitude shitty
Like G Gordon Litty
Take pity on a child
Thats been raised in the city

Chill- From East to West
To maintain my rep
So many times
To assume my flow
I go mono, stereo 
Or solo
You never know
Choose a flow
And I'll throw the phattest atom
I'm so hot, and so law
And so far from the plan
I reflectulate the ladies 
That be scannin
My composition decirclar
Hurtin the madd opposition

[Chorus x 2]
