[Chorus x 2]

No doubt
Hold tight
Till the break of dawn
Till the break of light 

Say yes, yes ya'll
To the right beat
Get up everybody's bout to leave their feet
Get down everybody's bout to lose their seat
I be huntin down crews like Pacino in Heat
Puttin phsycology in your biology
No scientolgy
Dianedic anistedic
You took bad advise
Kid, I'm madd precise
When it's time to get nice
I heat it up like Spice

[Chorus x 2]

C'mon lets be real
You only think you can deal
Cause when I'm holdin the steel
I rock shit that make you feel like
"Damn that look easy, maybe I could do it"
So you take a phat beat
And put your wack rhymes to it
And God only knows
What could make you persue it
For those that cant dance
Just clap your hands to it

[Chorus]

You tell me you the baddest
And you get the most cream
But tell me whats the status 
On your self esteem
You fronin on your jewels
And your Bens 
And your Lex, 
All the bodies that you caught
And all the Females you sexed
Yes, Yes ya'll
True indeed
The sight of the world 
Keeps me high on weed
Makes my eyeballs bleed
but I must proceed
Yo that chic's good lookin
But she's hooked on speed
Buy a first row ticket 
Watch the vultures feed
Get you culture free
From the lust and greed

[Chorus x 2]
