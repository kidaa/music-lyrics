I walk through the valley of death, 600 deep
Waking up dead from the sleep
Just like a diamond
Watch me shine
Bright like the sun
Make you wanna pull a gun
And buck 2 shots
For the peckerwood rockin'
Put down your glock
Or your block, I'll be knockin'
And dead off your shoulders
Head will roll
Peckerwood P
Funk assassin of soul
Is in control
So have no fear
I'm in this for real
Make it crystal clear
I get a little better each and every year
It's called improvement
Your style's a bowel movement
I'm taking you back to mount CulMcClarin
My whole family's stoned but there aint one sharin'
So whatcha looking at
Huh, why you starin'
Just take a picture
Before I have to hit ya
Ease back kid, gimme some space
Or Whoop there it is upside your face

[Chorus 1]

'Cause a hero aint nothin' but a sandwich
And a legend aint nothin' but a car
So shoot dope in your veins
And get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star
You know a hero aint nothin' but a sandwich
And a legend aint nothin' but a car
So go blow out your brains to get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star

I live in the house
And it's full of pain
But still out the frame
I'm going insane
I stay on point like a sniper
Chillin' in the viper room
Before it became a tomb
Take the low road
And you hit rock bottom
And keep low riding
All the way to Saddam
And back to Gamora
Now you're seora
Fill it with Salt !
And it's all your fault
Get the S&M; downtown
At the vault
Dirty little fuckup
Raising hell
But next year we'll all talk about how you fell
Because you're judged on how your records sell

[Chorus 2]

A hero aint nothin' but a sandwich
And a legend aint nothin' but a car
So get locked up in chains to get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star
You know a hero aint nothin' but a sandwich
And a legend aint nothin' but a car
So go blow out your brains to get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star

And maybe one day you be a star [4x]

Let's break it down
To the bear root essence 
Count your fingers
Then count your blessings
True confessions
Ask the questions
Substitute your answers with your obsessions
I take to the break of dawn of time
I do it all the time
But you know it don't come easy
Cause I turn on the TV
I see more and more pain and less and less glory
And it's the same ol' story
Ya see year after year the programs sphered
But I aint subscribing
Till there's live executions on Pay-Per View
Word to Donahue
Put on Melrose Place
Whoop there it is upside your face

[Chorus 3]

Cause a hero aint nuthin but a sandwich
And a legend aint nuthin but a car
So shoot dope in our veins
To get that fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star
You know a hero aint nuthin but a sandwich
And a legend aint nuthin but a star
So go blow out your brains
Like Kurt Cobain
And maybe one day you'll be a star

Mabey one day you'll be a star [4x]
