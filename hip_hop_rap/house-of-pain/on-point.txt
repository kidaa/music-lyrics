I'm sick, demented
I came unrepresented
I rose from the grave
I had a close shave
The cops tried to lock me down
'Cause the Glock they found
Was stolen
That's how I'm rollin'
Calvin Klein's
No friend of mine
So I don't like Marky
Or the monarchy
Don't start me up like a Rollin' Stone
I leave you sulkin'
Like Macaulay Culkin
In Home Alone
So Get A Grip
Like Stephen Tyler
I used to trip
With the Divine Styler
Back in the days
There were Irish ways
And Irish laws
to stand up for the cause

[chorus 4x]
When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man

Well it's the D to the A, double N Y BO
Y 'cause I rock shit like Ronnie Dio
It's a black day of rest
Quick run get your vest
I'm down with the Hill
'Cause I still got the skill
To turn the party out
It's all about the skyscraper
Your girl caught the vapors
So I might videotape her
I make a lot of the paper
So I don't have to scrape the
Bottom of the barrel
I rock fly apparel
Now I could pull you car
Starting up the Harley Davidson
I got the gun
So the drama you could save it
Well it's the mad bum rushin'
Funky with percussion
From L.A. to Flushing
I get your girlie blushin'
I'll cutcha' like the butcher
But it and Joe the writer
The old rock a loop
'Cause I'm super like Schneider

[chorus 4x]

I'm ill, retarded
So don't ya get me started
I might lose my cool
Ya lose if we duel
'Cause I can stomp a hole
In the sole of a monk
With the rhymes in my head
And the beats in my trunk
I got the skill kid
And I'm gonna' milk it
For all it's worth
I'm gettin' mines on earth
So step to the next head
Or like Sadat X said
He's gone
And that's it's supposed to be
Don't stand so close to me

[chorus 4x]
