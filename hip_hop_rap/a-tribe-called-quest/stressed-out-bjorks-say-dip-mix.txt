You know I look for trouble but trouble didn't follow me
All I wanted to be was an iller MC
Ever since nigga small as I grew up in Queens
What did you mosh of the Nontall Holla Me!
I turned my best friend Quaturem em head what I'd seen
And ever since that day y'll hear me things been a mess
R&B; goes to rocky, true I tell and bless
So nowadays I go and see wifey just to kill me from stress
Lay my head on her breast, sugar definitely knows best
Explaining all my problems to her, gettin things off my chest
A lil hug up squeez up and no more I vent
Aiyo Sunny, without my peeps I'd be truely assed out
Making sure I have my lettercations so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me when everyone was fessing
Most of Ja Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

[Chorus: Faith Evans]

I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
