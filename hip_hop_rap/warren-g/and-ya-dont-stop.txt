For 94, I'm a just glide and swerve
hop up the streets with my heats so observe
its me Z the whee Z, the Warren to the G Z
the deuces and the treys as kickin it through E-Z
and the beach and the bottle where I'm found
fuckin around with the muthafuckin Dogg Pound
fuck it, Warren's goin wild
the G Funk Era and the muthafuckin G Child
funk, melody, rhythm, base
he which is I is in the muthafuckin place
so let me get away, come again like this
I can turn into a murderer so please dont diss
cuz if you do, you know where I'm from
rat tat tat tat diddy dum diddy dum
Chorus
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
Well let me grab my stick and shift to first
I'm spittin plenty game on my second verse
well let me switch to second just for the rough ride
L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H Eastside
Where the grass is greener, at some times
and I dont do shit but drop funky rhymes
now I'm in neutral, shifting to third
cuz what you hear is what you heard, nigga
from the G-Funk, G-Funk, cuz we funk, we funk
and if you step muthafucka you get stomped
like 1, 2, 3 I'm shiftin to the fo
but you dont hear me doe
Chorus
I said humpty dumpty sat on the wall
I guess its time for me to sum it up for all
G Funk, G Child, gangsta groove, locc
past tense it's the Indo smoke
choke, off the shit that I'm doin
I'm droppin this shit for you and you and you and
cuz its me, the Warren to the G
comin in 1994 you see
the LBC and thats my locale
check it out check it out check it out now
Chorus
You know what I'm sayin, Warren motherfuckin G beeyatch
You know what I'm sayin, it's 94 that's how we doin it
Ain't nuthin but a Long Beach thang doe big baby, hey
G-Funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm
Check me out doe, beeyatch
