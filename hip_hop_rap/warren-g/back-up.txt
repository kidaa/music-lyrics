Now, now go
You got me fucked up
Why?
Cuz I'm a bad muthafucka and you can't understand me

[Chorus]
MCs dont know how we puts it down
K-9 and P-C from East to North town
We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon

[P-C]
Nigga back up, see I came to stack up
bodies like hits, whats that
you wanted to act up, and diss the click
a sister, put my niggaz up wetted the grave
you wanted to get richer, so offer your beats that made by fade
cascade, because yo ass is soapy
Mr. Locc you wanna be Mr. low key
when yo ass used to be low key
you know me so act like you know my click
and I'm an assist to kick the shit that you and MD could never get with
and speakin of MD, another nigga that used to be from my click
act like he double to down, but when it go down, go down he splits
this is strictly for all of y'all niggaz that diss me
y'all think y'all skills is up to par well stars come out and get me
now we got these niggaz out on the streets, and a place to lay my gun?
I guess you could say that I got hostess, in more ways than one
y'all keep clickin and clickin, my chips continue to stack up?
but while you dissin and dissin I'm a tell you niggaz to back up cuz

[Chorus x2]
MCs dont know how we puts it down
K-9 and P-C from East to North town
We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon

[K-9]
Hey K-9 what about Mad Dog
Well let that nigga loose
no better yet just let the dog loose
so he could fetch, goin to Vegas to see what he catch
ain't gonna be no cases
just tell him what he faces and watch him snitch
while I lay up in Vegas
its either the Raiders or the switch so he did
switched over like electric shocks
Moms got on pregnant static
so they suspected pops
did they know about me
Mr. K-9 see, clicksta in deep, in your Mama's panties
did they know that I was bangin it
where at, oh your Daddy's bread be back
now she's pregnant and I ain't claimin it
your husband's cryin cuz he feels like a chump
what, your son is fit to die and he ain't nuthin but a punk huh
she can't sayin nuthin cuz she needs my support?
but not for the child see the hooker's tryin to take him to court
and I'm a body like Jah
but accept with mo mil
we probably wasmeant for each other
cuz we two niggaz they gave us both jams

[Chorus x2]
MCs dont know how we puts it down
K-9 and P-C from East to North town
We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon

So when the east is in thewhen the north is in the house
Back up, back up
So when the west is in thewhen the south is in the house
Back up, back up
So when the east is in thewhen the north is in the house
Back up, back up
So when the west is in thewhen the south is in the house
Back up, back up
So my click is in the when da click is in the house
Back up, back up
So when K-9 is in the when K-9 is in the house
Back up, back up
So when P-C is in the when P-C is in the house
Back up, back up
When Warren G is in the when Warren G is in the house
Back up, back up

[Chorus x4]
MCs dont know how we puts it down
K-9 and P-C from East to North town
We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon
