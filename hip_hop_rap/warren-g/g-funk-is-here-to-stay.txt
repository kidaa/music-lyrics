Definitely On The G Funk Vibe

This rap shit got my own cactuses
like we never slept on the same mattresses
Young age football practices
Biscuit shine, Five of the ones on the waistline
I ain't worried about no platinum change
I'll give ya a 59 with a batman ass go range
[Mumbled speech]
Ok, musta being the zodiac
V.I.P I really don't let this shit get to me
I just flip tracks, spit facts
get relaxed, with G Funk laxed in the back
We stay in the ghetto, havin a tap with rugrats
cats, and taps, with flaps
Foul language, old english it's dangerous
It stays the same and never changes
[Crumbling cries]
G Funk is here to stay
I pop a cap
domino's and spades
with a bag of gange and smoke it all day
there's a staircase, its a true 21
Here's a toast to the thugs
High drop 4 sheezy, drinkin' ma bud
i still love n-a-t-e
rollin from the sheezys
With a dress code like dubsy and a circle arse
G-Funk is here to stay
