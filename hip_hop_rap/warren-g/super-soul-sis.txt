Well it's the super, the duper, the Landcruisin trooper
?Take action? at times, they hang on my rhyme like Mr. Cooper
I'm takin you to a zone that's much far from wackness
So please could you tell me oh bud buddy can you hack this?
Yo, oh no, grab a hold of fadeables, gettin her flows on
like FloJo, rhymes in a marathon
Smooth like chocolate, so call me Big Mamma Kane
Feels like another one goin out for her reign
Step back, because I happen to be on that plus tax
I got more subscribers than HBO or Cinemax
Nile at the mile I rip style after style
Crack dope in all the vials, ooh I'm glad I used Dial
Cause they can't get funky when I'm singin my song
but I just flow on, and so on, I'm stinky cause I roll on
And then I hear rhyme callin I won't give it a rest
That's how I got the motherfuckin Super on my chest

[chorus]
[Snoop:] Fly through the sky gettin love
[?:] the whole wide world will watch me
[repeat 2X]

Mister it's the, Masta Aces of the spade
Rappin skills are thinner than niggaz on AIDS
Up up and away it's the Super Soul Sis
I talk so much shit I got, halitosis
I knows this, I flows this, I'm funky, you stank
You a walkin blood bank I whip y'all with my shank
Danks for the memories, remember me no remedies
or end in the vicinity or catch a cap like a Kennedy
Cause I'm the Superwoman rapper I deserve a hail
Chasin MC's, got em on the run like Smurfs from Azrael
No bluff, the magic I puff, I'm chokin sho nuff
I'm takin a bite out of rappers if my name was MC Negra
[Warren G:] She's hotter than the South land on fire
All you MC's desire, to run through my pyre
I'm turnin heads like the Exorcist while flexin this
Cause it's the Super Soul Sis

[chorus]

Sat on the outside, but now I'm the arena
A superfly mackadocious one you never seen a
soulful, cause I got a bowl-full of soul
Strollin because I have no vehicle to roll
But bring it bring it back to the topic of the solar mind
I can flow upbeat, to a slow beat, and be off beat and still on time
I rhyme, and swim waves of soul like Billy Ocean
Never ashy, lyrics that soothe ya like some lotion
Cause I can Krush any Groove bust on any move ya make
I keep my rhymes attached, like trains to a freight
Break ya Achey like Billy Ray, I'm fuckin up the industry
And fins to be, Nanu Nanu like Mork and Mindy

[chorus]
