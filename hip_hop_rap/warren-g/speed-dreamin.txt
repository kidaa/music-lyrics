Heres to that someone who cant take the puressure
Mercy for that poor fu who made the news
Who feel pissed on that insist on killing all men
cant take the sorrow of the horrors of his abuse
It ain't worth the sorrows to cuase the death ......all men
Hes a discrase to the species in to his face with some feacies
Big nose mothafucka got it comin'
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucka
How many days you have to be before you get absent
Warren G with the P you beta step asside I'll stick my foot so far up in your ass
The water his knee will rise above your head and drown before you get your ass kickin'
Stomp stepin' in footsteps hard to keep up with
Warren G stepin' hard but it ain't as hard as it goN get
