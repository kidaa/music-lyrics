Wanted Dead 

On a high speed chase they recognize my plates 
Wanted for a 187 in three states 
Got my glock cock, mind is ill mental 
Blastin' at one time through my back window, shit 
Sick individual, murder was my ritual 
Mashin' in a hard top four, all original 
Bout a dozen of cops all behind me 
Mad as fuck cause Ice Cube is my crimey 
Like a missile launch led from my pistol 
Jumpin' hills like the streets of San Francisco 
Hard tryin' to stump him, reload my dumper 
Hit the ground, lost my hubcaps and my back bumper 
A hundred and ten, Westbound on the freeway 
Bo guardin' traffic cause I do shit the G way 
Hard to survive, lit up a 45 
No alive instead Mack 10 wanted dead 

And it's on, stick to the fire, loop get me high 
Drop the four in low, as I smoke the back tires 
Peddle to the floor in a bucket low low 
One time trailin', hittin' corners, fish tailin' 
I continue to cap as the gap starts to pull again 
Mashin' through Fullerton, a all points bulletin 
Wigs get pilled, nigga, runnin' from the kill 
Bugs flyin' into my grill and windshield 
Never see trial, say fck tryin' to stretch me 
Mack 10 a fuckin' dead man if they catch me 
Stompin' through red lights, no headlights on my vehicle 
5150 is my penal code 
I empty the clips when I carry'em, aimin' to bury'em 
Nigga fresh out the sanitarium 
LAPD tryin' to blow off my beanie 
Want the whole world to see me 
Put my face on TV, for real 

Fuck this shit, if they catch me I'ma goner 
Runnin' for my life, I continue to hit corners 
With my heat, 50 rounds deep 
Nigga, goin' down, holdin' trial in the street, fuck it 
If it's on like that 
It's about who's nuts is fat 
And who's straightest with they gat, for real 
That's how it be, livin' like a G 
It's better them than me facin' strike number three 
Heel no, I can't fuck with the lock down 
Mack 10'll grab the Mack 10 
And set the glock down and I'm runnin' 
Freeze was my order, cappin' at they ass 
As I hit the border and I'm gone
