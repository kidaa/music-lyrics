Chicken Hawk II 

Talking: The record you about to hear is basically true. 
The names have been changed to protect the guilty. You a cold nigga 

Some breathe gangsta shit, 
we dream of gangsta shit Repeat 

Verse 1 
I hit licks nigga lead the hood in strong arm 
'bout to get more chickens than Foster Farms 
Now give it up or die this a mothafuckin' jack 
hustlas guard yo sack the chicken hawk is back 
Impatiently waiting out of hunger 
my instinct to kill got stronger 
my wingspan's longer 
my guns loaded up and before you know what hit you 
I jump off the wire swoop and then I get you 
And fuck a tussle bitch cause all I do is shoot 
put lead in ya dome take ya sack and ya loot 
With a foe foe .44 revolver so my strap ain't a jammer 
I want pure Peruvian no cuttin' Arm   Hammer 
Gotta take what I need that's how the ball bounces 
now decide if you go die over thirty six ounces 
Before I go make sure no cameras in the vents 
pull a feather from my tail and dust off my claw prints 
Nigga 

Chorus 
You knew that I was dangerous 
when ya took it 
Look the Chicken Hawk two is after you 
Repeat 
In search of super chicken Have you seen him? 
Repeat 4X 

Verse 2 
Yo girl gave me the cock 
but now she holla rape 
So I take her to my nest 
and wrap her with the duct tape 
Pull my heat out squeeze and make these Teflons melt her 
and watch blood drip all down the walls like Heltah Skeltah 
Take flight over the woods to drop the body 
and hit a lake to rinse off 'cause my feathers all spotty 
I stalk once again caught my prey by surprise 
look in his eyes if he lies he dies before sunrise 
Where the work at fool the jack is on 
you feel the wrath of the chrome 
kick in or get your noodles blown 
So hurry the fuck up nigga take me to the safe 
It ain't no time to waste with this Magnum in ya face 
Make one false move I swear the gunshots rang out 
first I'ma kill you then I'ma blow ya bitch brains out 
A hawks technicality is pecking for his salary 
so keep the dope whoopin' while the Hawk'll keep swoopin' 

Chorus 

Mack Dime and that's one to grow on mothafuckas.
