Inglewood Swangin' 

 The announcer's voice from Playstation's NBA Live '97> 
"Welcome to Inglewood, California" 

Hey hey hey 
What you got to say 

Verse 1 
Fast bitches fast cars money and fame 
this rap shit is just like the '90's dope game 
Before sold out shows rocked and hoes jocked 
it was all about the 'hood and that Foe Hundred block 
A few scraps as a puppy dog 
you had to be down 
to roam that infamous neighborhood 
where niggas wore the crown 
It was on every morning from Manchester to Century 
BG's walkin' in packs to elementary 
afterschool some had 'hood patrol 
and watched deals on the corner 
while others had skills and hittin' drills in Pop Warner 
The unforgettable good old days how it used to be 
'foe niggas made the transition from a jock to a G 
now the streets is nice but the police is thick 
'cause niggas sick and mo' murders 
committed than a horror flick 
but whatever happen rappin' or not 
it's the same for me 
it's still I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E. 
so... 

Chorus 
Hey hey heyy 
What you got to say 
Inglewooooood  Inglewood echoes> 
Inglewood Swangin'  Inglewood echoes> 

Verse 2 
The city's full of cheddar like a cheese pizza 
known for senoritas and Inglewood Familias 
The landmarks in the 'hood is legendary 
the fabulous Forum, the Court and the Library 
The city hall is scandalous to the average tax payer 
so the town done fucked around and voted me the mayor 
had G's that put they life on the line and some died 
but thanks to this rap we on the map worldwide 
And as far as race go we probably even these days 
about 50% black and the rest is esays 
so we spin and we win up and down Market St. 
Bitch I'm a million dollar nigga and still shop the Swapmeet 
what I'm in right now probably ain't worth a hundred bucks 
a beany T-shirt khakis and a fresh pair of Chucks 
That's a real nigga foe you that's me so don't knock it 
I got everything I need plus money in my pocket 
So... 

Chorus 

Bridge 
I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E. 4X 

Verse 3 
It seem like yesterday I was the average Y.G. 
and at the blink of a eye became a household MC 
From the land of sunshine gold D's and palm trees 
to Japanese screamin' for a nigga overseas 
But I gotta think about O.G's I got game from 
remain the same nigga and can't forget where I came from 
We all know money make the world go 'round 
so I give back to my town and put a few niggas down 
I keep my enemies close 'cause they salt shakers 
mad because I travel state to state 
and get paid like the Lakers 
Used to like the Magic man when I was a itty bitty 
but now Mack and Shaq can go half and buy the city 
So... 

Chorus
