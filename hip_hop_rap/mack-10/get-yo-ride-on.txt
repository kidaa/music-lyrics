Get yo Ride On 
f/ Eazy-E, MC Eiht 


Mack 10: Do some shit with my niggas from the CPT, ha ha 
               You ready Eiht? 

MC Eiht: Yeah, c'mon 

Verse 1: Mack 10 

I was born to ride, bangin, pack heat 
got turned out early by them scandliss freaks 
addicted to crime so I stay in the mix 
with a love for hoochie chicks and pullin jewelry licks 
moms said, "Mack, baby watch for danger" 
I said, "Momma don't you know I'm a real gangbanger?" 
I can't switch over night and be good 
and I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood 
so I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal 
twistin tripple gold with the all black eagle 
got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat 
so I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck 
he said, "Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated 
and here's the extra clip incase you might need it" 
get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on 
throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on 

Chorus: 
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you 
you Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew 
get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best 
nobody rides like these killas from the west 

Ride for me, I'ma ride for you 
you Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew 
get yo slide on, get yo ride on, who the best 
nobody rides like these killas from the west 

Verse 2: Eazy E 

1, 2, 3, and to the 4 
Eazy muthafuckin E with a chrome to your dome 
cruisin, in my 6-4 rag top 
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fuckin block 
now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin 
more bounce to the ounce and I'm clownin 
keep the gat in my lap cuz I'm fully strapped 
for the car jackers, but no haps cuz I pack a 
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47 
send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven 
peep, nigga I don't sleep 
bury muthafuckas in the concrete 
you try to creep kinda slow in a Astro 
but I'm peepin niggas out in my left window 
so I blast, and I blast, so I blast no more 
yo, they call me motherfuckin John Doe 

Chorus 

Verse 3: MC Eiht 

Real thugs roll cuz the Westside's sick 
which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip 
slick, but not like Rick, the gang story 
G's kill and aint shit funny like Joe Corry 
don't make me laugh cuz I"m on the wrong the path 
catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath 
slang strike to make money, now aint that simple? 
that silly nigga's wearin vest's but we aim for the temple 
watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo 
keep the calico with extra ammo 
so and so gets blasted, to the casket 
never seen these westside G's face, we masked it 
ya'll best be defeat and be discreet 
catch the hot heat from across the street 
take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me 
retaliation, straight better than hitten pussy 

Chorus 

Ugh, MC Eiht in the muthafuckin house 
yeah, Hoo-Bang one time

Hoo-Bang two times 
rest in peace Eazy E
