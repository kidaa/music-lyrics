[Verse 1 Kelly:]
Searching for a destiny thats mine
Theres another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
[LaTavia:] Boy I love you but I gotta let you go 

[Chorus:]
Everday in my mind it's confusion
Thoughts of you brings Illusions
Trapped in my world only you get in 
My minds playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind it's confusion
Thoughts of you brings Illusions
Trapped in my world only you get in 
My minds playing tricks on me again 

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
Follow your emotions every where
Is there really magic in the air
Never let your feelings let down 
Open up your eyes and look around
[LaTavia:] Boy I love you but I gotta let you go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 Beyonce:]
Can it be a picture in my mind
Never show exactly what I find
Only in my dreams I turn you on
If for just a moment then your gone
LaTavia:Boy I love you but I gotta let you go

[Chorus]

[Pras:]
Ayo, I dont write love songs
Leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live 
You dont wanna know the cause
I pay to be the boss
Hear it straight from source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Kornesh style
Joy riding
Blowing candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, Mom tell me how you really like it
cause we could fly high
I'll be your cold pilot
[LaTavia:] Ayo back to girl with all the razzimatazz
[Pras:] Ayo I love you shorty
[LaTavia:] You talkin all that jazz
Boy I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the lotto
Use and abuse me so there wont be no friction
I gotta leave I cant be in this Illusion

[Chorus]
