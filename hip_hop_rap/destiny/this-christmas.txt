Hang all the mistletoe,
I'm gonna get to know you better, this Christmas .
And as we trim the tree,
How much fun it's gonna be together, this Christmas.

Fireside is blazing bright,
We're carolin' through the night.
And this Christmas will be,
A very special Christmas for me.

Presents and cards are here,
My world is filled with cheer and you, this Christmas.
And as I look around,
Your eyes outshine the town, yes they do, this Christmas.
Shake a hand, shake a hand, darling
The fireside is blazing bright,
When we're carolin' through the night.
And this Christmas will be,
A very special Christmas for me, yeah.
