[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he dont come who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone,
Cause everything he likes is with me 

[Beyonce:]
If I was in your shoes I would've had to let him go
From the first sign of him tryin to play
If you want me to stay you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no
You wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while your waiting, thinkin everything is gonna be ok
I gotta him, I gotta him, right here with me, oh ho 

[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he dont come who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone, leaves you alone
Do you ever wonder when he dont come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Cause everything he likes is with me 

[Kelly:]
I wanna call you so bad and tell you
He's sick of you
Girl what you put him through 
Do you expect to mistreat him and he still be with you
No, No, No, No, No 
Thats why he's here with me
I dont care what you say
You cant play with Destiny 

[Hook:]
Now as far as I know
he's in good hands
So you can stop calling all around
Saying have you seen my man
Aint no need to fuss n' fight
Tryin to make it right
No ho
Certain things aint meant to be
And that's why, that's why he's right with me 

[P:]
Be right here if you bout' it bout' Master P and Destiny can get rowdy rowdy 
Holla if at me if you hear me 
All its takes is a beep to get near me ugh,

Live a life of a G 
But tonight girl its gon' be you and me

Moet champagne I mean strong guaranties she calling my name 
Ya hollin P never leave me 
But if ya really wanna be with hug me and squeeze me 
Real killaz like to ride

Lets go front back side to side 
You be precious like a flower 
And if you real girl It aint all about the gizar 
But never mix buisness with plesure you really want me
