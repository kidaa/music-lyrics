I like the way I feel 
The way you keep it real 
So many simple things 
That you don't know the joy you bring 
I like how you an me work 
when we hang out we're so happy 
I never want it to end 
I know that we'll always be down and be together 
cos that's how I want to be 

Any time you're feelin down 
I will always be around 
Know that 

You know that. 

You don't have to go nowhere 
I will always be right here 
Know that 

You know that.. 

I crazy 'bout the way 
You let me do my thing 
So many reasons why 
I want you in my life 
I like how you and me 
no doubt about 
We're were meant to be 

I never want it to end 
I know that we'll always be down and be together 
that's how I want it to be 

so.. 

no doubt about.. 
I got ya back 
Can no one come between us 

together -- forever babe
