Never lost that feeling 
Once I got that feeling for you I knew 
That there was something special 
You had a certain sparkle bout you, it's true 

I cannot be more sincere 
Boy whenever you are near 
I just lose my mind, I get weak inside 
Swear I can do anything, yeah and I... 

I can't help myself 
I'm in love with you and nobody else 
It's real as hell 
And I can't deny it's how I feel 

Never did stop falling 
Once you started calling for me, so deep 
Living in denial, couldn't see what you saw in me 
Ooooh, baby, baby, now I 

I can see it all so clear 
I have nothing left to fear 
With you by my side, ain't no need to hide 
I can tell you anything 

I can't help myself 
I'm in love with you and nobody else 
It's real as hell 
And I can't deny it's how I feel 

Feel... feel... feel 

I I can't help myself 
Can't help I can't help myself 
Myself Oooh 
Ooh, baby, baby now I 

I can see it all so clear 
I have nothing left to fear 
With you by my side ain't no need to hide 
I can tell you anything 

I can't help myself 
I'm in love with you and nobody else 
It's real as hell 
And I can't deny it's how I feel
