[LaTavia:]

Oh baby where'd you go
I need you back wit' me
Oh baby where'd you go
I need you back wit' me, uh 

[Repeat above with Chorus 2x's]

Where'd you go Where'd you go
Where'd you go, oh no
So baby please, come back to me 

[Verse 1 - Beyonce:]
It has been five days
You haven't called me
Do you still want me, still need me
Am I on your mind
Are you thinking of me
Are you missing me like I miss you
Crying constantly
Runnin' out the reasons
Why I haven't heard from you, I'm worried
Got me doin' crazy things
I can't even sleep, gotta get you back to me 

[Chorus]

Where'd you go, I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So baby please, come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
[Repeat]

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
Thinking of everything
That you told me
Said you'd never leave me, deceive me
Got my mind thrown off
Did you just use me, boy you confused me
Gonna lose me
I can't deal with all the pain
And hell you put me through
Cause I'm still missing you, wanna be wit' you
Without you here I'm breaking down inside
Oh baby tell me why
Why did you hurt me, hurt me 

[Repeat Chorus 2x's]

Destiny's Child help me out 

It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me 

[Repeat chorus until fade]
