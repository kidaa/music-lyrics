[Kelly]
How many times
Are you gonna apologize about the same thing
And how many times can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong
When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong, yeah
I thought maybe if I started prayin'
That we would get better, but
When I would pray the answer would always come back to me bein' done
But we are so hard headed when we're in love
So I

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same 
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And everytime that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take his bad habit no more

[Kelly]
I'm totally out of my element
Learnin' new ways to live, while your in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin, you couldn't think about me to call 
And then when I get mad you buy me gifts 
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue
From the girl callin my phone, to the pictures that I saw
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've takin all I could take I've takin all I could take
But the way I live has gotta change, oh

[Chorus]

[Bridge Kelly]
Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you was just to blind to see
Past, all of the pain they was causin' you
Ladies do you feel me do you feel me
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right things that you should do
Then it's time to make a change
So I

[Chorus]
