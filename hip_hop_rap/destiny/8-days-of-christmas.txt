[Speaking:]
You know x-mas 
Was made for the children 
Destiny's Child 
2G x-mas 
Destiny's Child 
Ah-ah 
Ah 

[Verse 1:]
On the 8th day of Christmas my baby gave to me 
a pair of cloey shades & a diamond belly ring 
On the 7th day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
a nice back rub and he massaged my feet 
On the 6th day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
a crotch eye git with dirty denim jeans 
On the 5th day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
a poem that he wrote for me 

[Bridge:]
The the feelin' that I feel is so good 
He makes me feel so in lo-lo-lo-lo-love 
If he only knew what he does to me 
My man, my man, my baby 
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy 
I'm so in lo-lo-lo-lo-love 
How I love him for his generousity 
My man, my man, my baby 

[Chorus:]
Doesn't it feel like x-mas it feels lovely 
Doesn't it feel like x-mas it feels so lovely 
Doesn't it feel like x-mas wooooooooaaaaaaahhhh 
Yes it feels like x-mas 
Doesn't it feel like x-mas it feels lovely 
Doesn't it feel like x-mas it feels so lovely 
Doesn't it feel like x-mas the spirit of x-mas 
Yes it feels like x-mas 

[Verse 2:]
On the 4th day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
a candlelit dinner just me & my honey 
On the 3rd day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
a gift certificate to get my favorite CD's 
On the 2nd day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
the keys to a CLK Mercedes 
On the 1st day of x-mas my baby gave to me 
quality T-I-M-E 

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge 2:]
If it feels like x-mas 
Yes it's x-mas 
Bro's x-mas 
Mom's x-mas 
Dad's x-mas 
Bro's x-mas 
Feels like x-mas 
Feels like x-mas 

Farrah's x-mas 
Beyonce's x-mas 
Kelly's x-mas 
mom's x-mas 
dad's x-mas 
bro's x-mas 
Feels like x-mas 
Feels like x-mas
