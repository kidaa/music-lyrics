[Verse 1- Beyonce]

Wait a minute, wait a minute
I think I got to take some time and clear my mind cause if I don't I might scream
Scream out loud in a little bit
I'm a tell you what I'm talking about Ladies Ladies, ladies
If you know what I mean
When you in love you give your everything
I'm tired of that happening
This time is for you and me
You been doing you
I'm goin' do me
Ladies help me sing it

[Pre-chorus]
You steady telling lies
I stayed and pacified
While I kept denying the truth
You always here and there
Finally I don't care
I'm going to keep it real with you

[Chorus]
Ain't no feeling like being free
When your mind's made up
And your hearts in the right place, yeah
Ain't no feeling like being free
When you've done all you could
But what's misunderstood
It's all good, it's all good
Ain't no feeling like being free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me
Ain't no feeling like being free
Cause my mind's made up
And my heart is in the right place, yeah

[Verse 2- Beyonce]
Hold 'em up, wait a second
I got to get something off my chest
My happiness was our happiness, I lived and breathed
You and all your needs
Let me speak, it's best I do what's best for me
Now ladies, ladies
I got my mind back
I been there and done that no looking back no
Oh, this time is for me
If you been doing you
I'm going to do me
I'm free

[Pre-chorus 2]
Time is of the essence
And it's much too short to waste another minute on you
While you steady trying to hide
I'm packing saying bye
Thought you were my dream come true

[Repeat Chorus]
[Bridge Kelly]
No it ain't easy being left out no
Or being forgotten about being forgotten about
You don't deserve my love my love
I've had enough set me free free

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3- Michelle]
Can I get some loving mmm
Can I get some time mmm
Loving in the morning Yeah
And in the midnight hour baby,baby
I gave you everyting you wanted wanted
I gave you everything you needed mmm
But you just didn't do right no,no
So baby I'm leaving
It feels good to be free

[Chorus Out]
