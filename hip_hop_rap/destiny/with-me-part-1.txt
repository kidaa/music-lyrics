[J.D.:]
Everything ya like is with me
So if you know like I know 
This is where ya need to be 

[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he dont come who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone, leaves you alone
Do you ever wonder when he dont come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Everything he likes is with me 

[Beyonce:]
If I was in your shoes I would've had to let him know
From the first sign of him tryin to play
If you want me to stay you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no
You wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while your waiting, thinkin everything is gonna be ok
I gotta him right here with me, oh ho
[Chorus]

[Kelly:]
I wanna call you so bad and tell you
When it started and what we do
How long its been going 
And why he aint never gon come home
Cause I know what you didnt do to make him stay
See a bad performing, unfulfilling women, drives a man away
[Chorus]

[Hook:]
Now as far as I know
he's in good hands
So you can stop calling all around
Saying have you seen my man
Aint no need to fuss n' fight
Tryin to make it right
No ho
Certain things aint meant to be
And that's why, that's why he's right with me 

[J.D.:]
Everything ya like is with me
So if you know like I know 
This is where ya need to be
[Repeat 3x]

Do you wonder
[Chorus:]
Do you ever wonder when he dont come who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone, leaves you alone
Do you ever wonder when he dont come home who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone
Everything he likes is with me [repeat until end]
