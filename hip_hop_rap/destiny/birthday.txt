It's your birthday, you dont have to nothing

[Verse 1 Kelly:] The time has come and its finally here
Have a candle lit dinner
Or just settle down my dear
Whatever you like boy
Its all up to you
We could celebrate baby
Causeit's your birthday
[Beyonce:] Now close your eyes baby
And listen to the melody
Anything you want me sweet just ask me
It's the day for us to share
So leave your problems up to me
Let start you and me
And make this day history 

[Chorus:]
Its your birthdaywe could spend time together
We gon' celebrateyou and me
It's your birthdayso baby blow out the candles
We gon' celebrateyou know
It's your birthday 

[Verse 2 Kelly:]
Im sendin out invataions
To let all your friends know thatit's your birthday
But all that I really wanna do
Is wrap you up and get in the groove
And keep you all to myself
[Beyonce:] Now the mood is right now
And you dont have to fantize
All your dreams could come true, but its up to you
If you cant decide boy, just give me all your mind
Ive got a surprise a present that you'll like

[Chorus]
