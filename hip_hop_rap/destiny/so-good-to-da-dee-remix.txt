[Verse 1 Beyonce:]

Uh, yeah - to da Dee, like me!
Go down, in style, baby! Baby!

Hey how ya doin', yeah I'm doin' mighty fine Like, wha
Last time I seen ya, it's been a long time Long, boy!
Stop smilin' at me, get that look off your face Pssss
Please don't even front, stop bein' so fake Oh, sure!
I know you do not like me and you made it very clear
You're always talkin' about me from what I hear
Always put me down when you thought that you could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Hook: Kelly]

Wasn't it you that said...

Did you say it Huh, to da Dee

Thought I was all that and you said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
And wasn't it you that said
That I didn't look too good, that I wouldn't do too good
I'd never make it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Chorus:]

So good, so good, so good
I know you hate it, but I'm
So good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
It's hard to face it, but I'm
So good, so good, so good

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]

Where me angels Wassup

This is for them haters that said we wouldn't make it
Now we doin' platinum now you can't take it
For all the people 'round us that have been negative
Look at us now and see how we live
I stayed down wit' my people, all the ones that keep it real
Didn't get caught up, and how'd it make you feel
All the things I'm doin' that you thought I never could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Hook 2 Kelly:]

Wasn't it you that said
I thought I was all that and you said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
And wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't do too good
Look at me, now ain't God good
Now I made it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Repeat Chorus]

[Beyonce:]
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so good
Good, good, good, good, good

I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so good
Good, good, good, good, good

What you Like, scum - uh oh!
To the Dee, wid me!

[Repeat chorus until fade]
