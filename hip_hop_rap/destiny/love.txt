[Beyonce]
It had been many years since I've been in love
With a real man I had given up on love
I didn't think a good man existed in this world
I was tired, of searching
Because of relationships I've dealt with in the past
Couldn't fathom bein monogamous
When I least expected it, I found you
And because of you, I know how it feels to be

[Chorus A]
Love, and when I look into your eyes I see
Love, pillow talking at night I can hear 
Love, ooh, the next mornin' make
Love, I'm so in love

[Chorus B]
For you I live and love again
Open the pact to happiness
For you I learn to smile again
I thank God for you
For you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide and take my hand
For you I learn to smile again
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Kelly]
Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doin' things to show your proud of
Thirty beauties in the room only me you see
The confidence you give, lives in me
I vow to never break your heart or never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here, to share my life so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Chorus A]
[Chorus B]

[Michelle]
I thank God
For you
Your loves amazing
And like the rain it fell on me
Wanting it more and more cause your loves in the air
I breathe, lying beside me
You see into the soul of me
And your spirit sets me free

[Chorus B x2]

[DC]
Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doin' things to show your proud of
Thirty beauties in the room only me you see
The confidence you give, lives in me
I vow to never break your heart or never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here, to share my life so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Chorus B]
