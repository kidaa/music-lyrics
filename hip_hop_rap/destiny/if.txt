Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Michelle]
If I Don't Pick Up The Phone Like I Use To For You
Don't You take It Personal

[Kelly]
If I Don't Do I All The Things That I Use To To You
I Ain't Mad At You

[Beyonce]
If You Get To Feeling Stressed Up In Your Chest Thinking
That You About To Lose Baby It's True
And If You're Losing Out On Sleep 

[Michelle]
Home Worrying About Me Ohhhhhh

[Kelly]
This How It Be

[Chorus]
If You Don't Know
Now you Know You Going To Miss
My Love 
And I Ain't Stressing Bout A Dawg On Thang
Cause I was True When I Gave You
My Love My Love Yeahhh

If You Search You Will Never Find Another Love Like My Love
You going To Miss Me I Ain't Got Time While You Sit Around
And Play With my Love My Love

[Michelle]
If You Think I Caught A Feeling When I Heard About That Other Chick
Noooooo I Already New
About It

[Kelly]
I Just Needed Time Just To Clear My Mind And Ask Myself Why Didn't I Handle It

[Beyonce]
And If You Would've Taken care Of Home,'Stead Of Leaving Me Alone Cause I Would Be Right There
With You Taken Care Of You Steady loving You Like I Used To Do

[Chorus]

There Was Once A Time I Blamed Myself For What Was Wrong

[Michelle]
But I Can See So clearly Now Cause You Are Gone
That's How I Spend All My Time When You Weren't Home Playing  Around With Them Raggedy Hafers
No More stressing, No more crying, No More Trying
I Would Rather be Alone
I'd Rather Be All By Myself
Because This Valuable Heart Of Mine Was Yours Until I Realize Finally Opened My Eyes

[Kelly]
You See Ladies, I Know, I Knew Better What Was I Thinking. He Going To Miss Me When I'm Gone

[Chorus]
[Until Song Fade]
