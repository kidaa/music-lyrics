[Verse 1 Kelly:]
I wanna know, If i could get to know you
So many things, baby I cant wait to show you 
I dont know, if you feel the same as I do
Give me a sign baby, show me what to do

Can I be all you need
Can I be your everything
Baby the time is now
If you just show me how 

[Chorus:]
Show me the way to love you
Every night and everyday 
Im thinking of you
All I need is just the chance to love you
Show me the way baby, show me the way 

[Beyonce:]
What would it take for us to get together
I wanna know would you stay with me forever
Give me the chance 
I know I could make you love me
Just say the words baby let me make you see 

Can I be all you need
Can I be your everything
Baby the time is now
If you just show me how 

[Chorus] 
Show me the way, 
What would it take for me to love you
Every night everyday 
I want you to know, Im thinking of you
Im thinking of you 

[Chorus until end]
