[Intro Rap - Mocha:]
Yo, thats what luvas do
 color boo
Everything wonderful
Tee hee hee, I'm under you
Yea I seen it before
I dont need it no more
I'm overseas on tour, lettin my feet in the door
And for those niggaz that'll try to scam stacks from me
Well that depends on how u handle my cat for me
Ghetto 'fectionate and erectionate
But the less u trick, thats the less u get
There u go, I got impressions so stress on
U jus second best uhh
Stop second guess-on
U never listen, u cant stop it I'm on fire
Know that u goin leave out here wit your pockets lighter
Count a stack about a hundred grand, rubber band
I'm like your other hand, aint no other man
Understand, not til I told u that, hold that
I dont want it if u cant hold back, know that

[Verse 1:]
Baby boy, I can see that you want me
But baby it aint that easy
Take your time, and you can ride
You gotta work at me, cause I'm not that type Baby

[Hook:]
I need you to, stimulate me
You can have me
If you want me
I need you to, stimulate me
You can have me
If you want me

[Verse 2:]
Take me out in the six
Lemme know you wanna be up in the mix
You say you want my sweet body
But first you gotta pamper me
Say you gotta phat crib in the hills 
dont mean a thing to me
Unless I got the key
If you split, half goes to me Tell me

[Hook]

[Rap:]
[Male] Mami what u want from a playa like me
Out in the streets, livin O.C.
[Mocha] Papi what u want from a honey like me
Ghetto soup, hot Don P
[Male] Pick u up from college and take u to my crib
We can max out, tee hee hee hee hee
[Mocha] It sounds real sweet, but first we hit the mall
Shoppin sprees wit u coppin me

[Hook]

[Bridge Over Hook:]
Tell you what its all about
But first you gotta take me out
Promise me it will be good
Treat me like a balla should
