Uh, uh, oh

[Beyonce:]
Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

The day you pissed me off I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and I don't like to fuss 
He said he would look out for me If I needed a friend 
He took me to his house and then he invited me in 
Then we sat on the couch, he put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' and then he grabbed my face 
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before 
So you know what happened baby I need to say no more 

[1] - I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did 
I might as well come clean What you feel about that baby 
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did 
I might as well come clean What you feel about that baby 

[2] - I'm just guessing that you're through with me 
Cause I just came clean What you feel about that baby 
I'm just guessing, are you through with me 
Cause I just came clean What you feel about that

[Beyonce:]
Remember the time you wondered where your money went
I called my friends and bought some clothes And took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a Jeep And we talked all the time 
He asked me about my man And you know that I had to lie 
He thought I had no man and I was chillin' by myself 
Don't get mad cause I feel sad That's why I must confess 
Too many times I wanted to let you know my dirt 
But everytime you said you loved me I knew it would hurt 

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2 with addlibs]

[3] - I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had it in mind to play on you 
But look at all the hurt you put me through 
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth

[Repeat 3 3x]

[Repeat 1]

[Repeat 2]
