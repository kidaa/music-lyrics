[Chorus:]
Now that she's gone you wanna come back 
Is that a fact
You've got it like that
You made me wait too long, I'm gone
Now that she's gone you wanna come back 
Is that a fact
Think you've got it like that
You made me wait too long, I'm gone

[Verse 1 Kelly:]
Take her to the movies
Dinner all the time
Shopping sprees for her
On me you never spent a dime
But I was there for you
When you had nothing at all
Then you got a little job and
She's the one you call
And now

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2 Beyonce:]
Oh now you're taking me for granted
But you only get once chance
Then you left me hurting
And it won't happen again, no no
So she finally left you
It ain't no surprise
That you missed your water
Cause your well went dry, oh ho
Now thats she's gone babe

[Repeat Chorus]

[Hook:]
Understand, I understand 
Why you think I want you back 
After what you did to me 
Did you think you blinded me
Boy you know whatever you do 
It will all come back on you
Cause you tried to play me like a fool

Now that she's gone
You, crawlin' back
Got it like that
You made me wait too long
Oh, I'm gone
Now that she's gone
She's gone
Come back, oh
You made me wait too long
Too long, too long, too long, too long,
I'm gone
[Repeat chorus until fade]
