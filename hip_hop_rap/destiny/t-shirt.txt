[Spoken Beyonce]
Hey Baby
I Wish You Could See What I Have On Right Now 
You So Sexy
Imagine How Intense It Would Be
To Hold Me Right Now
Our Song's Playing

[Verse 1 Beyonce]
At Night, When You're Far And I'm Alone
I Feel The Fabric From Your T-Shirt
Close To My Body
I Can Still Hear Your Baritone
In My Ear Telling Me You'll Take It Slow
And I Was In The Mirror Playing A Roll
Like You Work It, I Couldn't Turn Me On
So I Fell Asleep With The Music On
Woke Up Again Hearing The Same Old Song, Playing

[PreChorus Kelly]
Oh Give It To Me Deeper
Oh Giving Me The Fever
Oh Now You Got My Feet Up
This One Is A Keeper
Now The Second Verse Is Playing
Oh We Tried To Stand Up
Oh Hold Me While My Hands Up
Oh And The Music Picks Up
Fantasies Were Shook Up
I'm Thinking To Myself Again

[Chorus]
When You're Not Here I Sleep In Your T-Shirt
I Wish You Were Here To Take Off Your T-Shirt
After We Make Love I Sleep In Your T-Shirt
Wake Up In Your T-Shirt,
Still Smell The Scent Of Your Cologne
When I Need Your Feel I Sleep In Your T-Shirt
I Need Help To Take Off Your T-Shirt
After We Make Love I Sleep In Your T-Shirt
Wake Up In Your T-Shirt,
Still Smell The Scent Of Your Cologne

[Verse 2 Beyonce]
Outside I Hear The Rain On My Windowpane
Hold Up A Minute, Thought I Heard Your Name
My Mind, Playing Tricks On Me Again
I Hear Knocks On The Door, Is That Baby Home
Why Couldn't It Be Reality?
Looked At The Clock It Says 4:03
At Nine, He'll Be Arriving On A Plane
Then We'll Be Making Love And Hearing The Song Again

[PreChorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge Michelle]
Oh Boy I've Been Waiting
Now My Body's Shaking
You're So Deep, Baby Please, Take It Easy
I Look At Your Face And
Got My Heart Racing
You're So Deep, Baby Please, Take It Easy

[Spoken Beyonce]
Keep It Right There
Oh, Wait, Wait, Yeah
Keep It Right There
You Driving Me Crazy

[Chorus Out]
