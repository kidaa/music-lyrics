Same old shit every day and every night
Then when it gets dark niggaz get outa sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
'Cuz Ain't no tellin' yo' some shit might pop tonight
";This type o' shit it happends every day"; [from la di da di / Doug E Fresh]
Same old shit every morning when I wake
I'm thinkin' of another bitch's money to take
I start to get dressed, Yo my bitch is still asleep
Go put the 9 milimeter gun in the jeep
And let it blow 'em up in hard coffee day
I wish somebody wake 'em up and have somethin' to say
I take out my dick, beat my girl right away
Grab a hand against the bitch and tell her 'have a nice day'
Then go around the corner cuz I fuck her best friend
It ain't a bitch down I don't put my dick in
I can't stay long I gotta hit the blvd.
Put your fist in your pussy bitch and breath real hard
Go to the shack with the G'z that's mega'
Gettin' drunk 
Niggaz can't take it alwayz havin' a fit
Yo, but it's the same old shit ..
Same old shit every day and every night
Then when it gets dark niggaz get outa sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
'Cuz Ain't no tellin' yo' some shit might pop tonight
Playin' dominoz, with a nigga and some ho's
Hot pussies and hard dicks it's lappin' big six
At this bitch's house for the very first time
Some niggaz came in and try to take what's mine
Tried to jack and the bitch played it off
She was in it all along, bitch screamin' ";what's wrong";
I said what de fuck de Mcten start to walk
Unloaded the click and then escaped to the park
I think I had one but I needed to shoot 'em all
Now I'm runnin' like shit - thinkin' 'bout gettin' hit
Now this bitch, that was hunged up with me
Was with these niggaz Lettin' off slugs at me
Oh shit can't trust a bitch I should've known
Fuckin' with a ho' now A niggaz cupboard's blown
But I got away without gettin' hit
Yo, cuz it's the same ol' shit

Four cashious's gonna rain 20%
I gotta pimp n' ho' so I can make up for de rent
Cuz ain't nobody gonna gimme shit if I don't take it
There's too much mothafuckin' money so I'm gonna make it
And when I make it I'm still the same nigga
So quit actin' like a bitch if my pocket's gettin' bigger
I'm pimpin' out my game like greedy told me in de mack
Alwayz watchin' my back, with my godamn gat
I do what I gotta do, I sell my rocks like a slanger
I say ";I don't give a fuck"; and be a gangbanger
I go back and forth in the penn bitch n' trip
Havin' little mothafuckaz lookin' up to me
Yeah, the shit feels good, I won't lie
A real ass nigga 'till the day I fuckin' die
So pass me the weed so I can take me a hit [of what?]
of the same old shit ..
Same old shit every day and every night
Then when it gets dark niggaz get outa sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
'Cuz Ain't no tellin' yo' some shit might pop tonight
