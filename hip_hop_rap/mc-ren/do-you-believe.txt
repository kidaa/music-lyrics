How de fuck can you believe, that people turns to spirits?
Don't run with that bullshit because I don't wanna hear it
The shit that you learned in the church - it only was worth
A bottle of piss, now lemme tell you what you missed :
Jesus was'nt white like the lion devil told you
He's the same devil that brought you from africa and sold you!
Made you take the white men's name and now you're one with the same
Playin' all of his devilish games
Ho' runnin' 'round in 93' with your slavemaster name 
like a Fool happy as you can be
Believe it in a burnin' hot hell
But the only hell you got was in the white men's jail cell
The devil owns every fuckin' thing
I doubt you can't make it unless you can tap or fall or sing
Now niggaz will be trippin' 'bout the shit I'm 'bout to speak
How can you go from the streets turnin' to chicks and eatin' pig feet
Lookin' for dope face turnin' to a hog
Mothafuckaz happy you ain't died from the smog
Niggaz got these white devil bitches for the ho's
Don't bring 'em in the room cuz the bitches are doomed

If you see a nigga with a white ho' beat his mothafuckin' ass
Remind a mothafucka of what happend in the past
Let me tell you somethin' that I think you oughta know
He's the same devil that came from ... 30 years ago
Then you got niggaz that's blacker than the night
Runnin' 'round town sayin' their best friends are white
Niggaz like that are gonna hang up from a tree
And burn 'em up aloud and let everybody see
Cuz in 93' we'll come and burn down your store
When niggaz sign up ....... 54'
If you hate the devil you should fall right then
Cuz all we're lookin' for is a few good men
So niggaz here we go here we go it's a trip
The devil seperates you by a blood and a crip
Cuz he knows if you're together yo we'll beat off in his ass
Go to white neighborhood and start to blast 
Nigga you believed ..
