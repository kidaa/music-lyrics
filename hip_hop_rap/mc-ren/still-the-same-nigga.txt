CHORUSrepeated
And check it out y'all Yo, I'm still the same nigga
This nigga be creepin' on fools all day and night
I got determined millimeters nigga, fuck a fight
'Cause niggaz don't scrap no mo', that's a no no
Fools get hot, they shoot yo' ass on the spot
'Cause bitch made niggaz get fucked like a ho
But be outta work like that nigga Arsenio
'Cause niggaz be talkin' shit behind my back
Wishin' they could get they hands sweatty on my nut sack
I ain't from Ohio, but I'm a player
So pussy ass niggaz what the fuck ya gotta say a
Poppa gotta brand new bag when I rock
'Cause niggaz on the corner sellin' shit out the ziplock
Uh, but me and my niggaz sit back and relax
While I fuck it up bustin' on them tight ass tracks
Yeah, you niggaz know where you can find me
I'm kickin' back in Compton with my niggaz behind me
Still the same nigga
CHORUS
I used to be a magician, but a nigga gave up tricks
'Cause my assistance was fuckin' too many dicks
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Fuck it, nigga makin' dead presidents
But niggaz be wantin' they hands in my pocket say gimme
For a penny, all they feelin' is the jimmy
Like Rick James I'm bustin' out on the funk
Nothin' up my sleeve, the shit is in the trunk
But don't make me bop that shit, and it's on
'Cause I can get rocky like Sylvester Stallone
Niggaz shootin' stones, motherfuck a sly
If I wanted to I could hit ya with my third eye
Then you'll be in a deep sleep
So bring the band by, 'cause nigga chokin' like I mad fly
I'm still takin' niggaz out
With the shit that's droppin' out my mouth
'Cause, I'm still the same nigga
CHORUS
Yeah minute you win it, a nigga ain't a loser
It's a black nigga hittin' corners on a beach cruiser
Or you might catch a nigga in a Chevy
'Cause my motherfuckin' shit is so heavy
Rap skits kicked to the curb, they gets no play
When I'm rollin' in the 4-54 in L.A.
Fuck the radio and they format
I got bitch made nigga killa wrote on my doormat
So niggaz don't ring my bell
I gotta bad attitude and I'm mad as hell
'Cause I break God damn necks with my rhymes
Niggaz in the street don't wanna fuck with mine
Devil's be askin' what I did
Tell 'em I make funky ass records, plus I built pyramids
But niggaz in the streets I'm a good fella
In the trench like Gotti, and the umbrella
Still the same nigga
CHORUS
