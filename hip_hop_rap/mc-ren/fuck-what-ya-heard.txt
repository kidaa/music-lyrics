Always carryin' a Mack 10, know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Always carryin' a Mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
In '93 I'm wreckin' shit so you can fuck what ya heard
I'm droppin' plenty shit like a motherfuckin' bird
I steal gangsta boogie if I gets my boogie on
Put my finger in my chrome keeps 'em fuckin' wit' my dome
Tellin' me to shoot all these niggaz that I hear
Bitchin' gossip in my ear, I hear this shit every year
Nigga still talkin' like a bitch
Mad 'cause another nigga tryin' ta get rich
I see ya tellin' niggaz, yo Ren is gonna fall
But I think ya dumb ass had too much of the 8 ball
Your own motherfucker don't know
That Ren can play ya low, ya didn't know I'd fuck your ho
Now the kid that you're claimin', yo you're very quick to claim
But to me it's just my gear with another fuckin' name
And niggaz wanna know what's the word?
So peep it out, you can fuck what ya heard
CHORUS
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Always carryin' a mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Always carryin' a mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Niggaz gimme looks like they wanna try and thump
Thinkin' Ren is just a chump, in the trunk I got the punk
Shoot it in the crowd, I shoot a niggaz in the back
All my niggaz in the shack started fuckin' in the lack
Some niggaz rolled up and said the truce was dead
Train said fuck it, shot the nigga in the head
And it's on, all y'all niggaz get to your post
Train just killed a nigga so we gotta do a ghost
Dip back to the hood, sip the 40 on the way
'Cause the niggaz from my motherfuckin' hood don't play
And ya still wanna know what's the word
Nigga fuck you and fuck what ya heard
CHORUS
Always carryin' a mack 10, know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
Always carryin' a mack 10, know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
He say, she say, who gives a fuck what they say?
Screamin' off at mayday the shit is goin' my way
Niggaz can't believe that I'm so much of a G
'Cause I don't let skanky bitches sit up under me
Now y'all niggaz out there y'all swear y'all can scrap
Get your ass kicked makes ya wanna try to rap
Sprung on a ho yo smokin' all your weed
Fuckin' with a bitch that ya really don't need
The click, my niggaz from the click pimps hoes
Rich, Train block my nigga, Bone and Jubee Lows
Them fools can't even say a word
'Cause a nigga don't give a fuck about what ya heard
CHORUS
Always carryin' a mack 10 know what I'm sayin'?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck wit'
repeat till end
