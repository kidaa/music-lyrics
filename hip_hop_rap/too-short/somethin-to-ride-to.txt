-Ant Banks-

Ahhhhhh shit
Now let me warm it up
I got the gin and juice and I'm a poor 'em cup
To get smooth in the mood that I'm in
So lets start riding till this mother fucker ends
And hit the main strip, where the hoes be hanging
Spitting some game and trying to throw that thang
On any young nigger with some ends
A mobile phone and a drop top benz
Take it from me, see
Cuz I know what it's about
Kick a big fat dick in a bitches mouth
And keep riding, high siding, but don't front
Nigger serve that shit, don't be no punk
And while the nigger's keep jocking
I be scoping
All the fine ass freaks of Oakland
That's where I reside, and where I always will be
The city of killers, dope dealers and still we
Chill like players, and like pimps
Mack all hoes and slap all simps
The big badass, I'm from the Dangerous Crew
I just hang with the gang like it's the thang to do
Now mother fuckers can't face the facts that I'm doing this
Rapping and producing and they can't even ruin this
See everybody knows the Banksta
The big dick gangsta who's fucking with dank and clocking the bank
And I'm a get  mine in the 9 O's
I mean the money, the fame, and the and the big thick fine hoes
I'm pulling up right beside you
Bumping this funky ass shit to ride to.

-Pooh Man-

Now here's some shit for you to ride to punk
Fifteeen's slamming hard in my god damn trunk
From tenth ave, to a hundred and fifth
Young players ride the foothill strip
They ride Chevys, Cougars, Blazers, Vettes
Five 60 Benzos with Ferrari kits
They love fine ass bitches, rolex watch
Top let down on the coke white drop
I love my high schools cuties
Muscle bound booties
Pools a hoes so you know I had to do my duties
I got to have it like a rabbit
Fuck her like a champ
I tell you nigger I'm a pro with these high school tramps
They say young minds, make good times
See I'm a player so let me give an O 9
Alicia, Tina, Marie, and Evette
She wanna ride punk bitch you can ride my dick
Now Shawnetta, Shawnda, an Rida too
Now here's a shot to the whole slug crew
Talk bad punk bitch but it's always Pooh
Kiss my ass and spend your cash, on this shit to ride to

-Goldy-

Pushing my dank coke into the key and start the engine
Hit song, joking time, smoking, donuts while I'm spinning
A tight haffa fullest engine with duels, and counts
fuck a spare tire in my trunk, it's boom, that slams
Cuz I'm a young brotha like to burn rubber yo ??? out of lanes
I pump it, while ya bump her, so ya change
Than I take a pitched out, exterior interior window
They wax me, then they buff me, niggers don't love me now I'm tipped out
Now I'm coming fresh from the detail shop
Going to the lee-male spots
Looking for the female cock
I feel the bass and woofer kick my chest like a heartbeat
Went to the curb, when I saw the ass of a dark freak
So I pulled up slamming Short Dogg
I said ";Hey";, she said snort
I said damn I'm fucking warthog
So I smashed out doing 90
Covered her ass up with the smoke I left behind me
The metly stently  flowed in my ears like oxygen
Too Short pulling the bass, got the hoes on our jocks again
Fucking with the hooties, with booties, and big titties
That's potent, but all I is cheese for a rodent
Got a ticket doing 60 in a school crossing
Picking up my young cock for some cool tossing
Defermation of character, racially slandering
But all I'm ever givin ya is pimping and pandering
So please let me go off of some
Because I could be at home in my bed tossing her
I make like altune, quick to value human dash
Hit the freeway cuz I can't play when I got some ass
Respect a player and an O G that's what they told me
Mhisani nickname Goldy

-Too Short-

Now I come from the mother fucking eastside
So shut the fuck up bitch and just ride
I'm Short Dogg, hoe you can't front me
Since my very first album I was funky
Bitches start seeing them dollar signs
Even though I wouldn't give a broke bitch one dime
It's kind of funny, they want money from a pimp
Bitch, you couldn't get 50 cents
I take a gap from your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game hoe, and I'm a vet
Playing broads ain't based on love
You want my money, I wanna fuck
And after we do all that, I talk about you in my next rap
Beyotch!!  Kiss my pimping ass
Cause all the time I didn't have this cash
Wouldn't call, wouldn't give me your number
I couldn't see ya like Stevie Wonder
I made a hit record
Now I got money
You wanna play $hort Dogg for a dummy
But I come from the mother fucking eastside
You suck my dick so I let the fake bitch ride
Dangerous music is on the mike
And like Banks always say, ";This shit is tight";

-unknown voice- ** note - below the words are probably very inaccurate.
