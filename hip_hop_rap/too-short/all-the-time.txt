[Too $hort]
All the time, gettin mine, that's why I'm pimpin

That's why I'm pimpin, all the time
Gettin mine..
That's how we do it, straight pimpin
All the time, all the time

It's the original, D-O-G, Short Dawg
They said don't do it, but I gotta go off
You talked a lot of shit and can't back it up
Say you make a lot of money and can't stack enough
Spend it on the strippers and the prostitutes
Do what you gotta do
No SoundScans got your record label hot at you
They droppin you, two years ago we was poppin you
You was talkin shit about nobody stoppin you
I told the lil' homey a long time ago
If you put your mind to it, you can find some dough
It don't matter, even if yo' pockets kinda low
All you gotta do is knock a fine ass hoe
Fuck that bitch like a porno star
Walk her to the corner I bet she won't go far
I knew the day would come when you would notice it
Get wise and realize bein broke ain't shit

Chorus: Too $hort

That's why I'm pimpin, all the time
Gettin hoes to give me money, I'm gettin mine
You know I ain't lyin
cause what I spend and what I'm ridin is the shit
That's why I do this; straight pimpin, all the time
If you see my bitch hoein, I'm gettin mine
You know I ain't lyin, tricks love what I'm supplyin
It's the shit, that's why I do this

[Too $hort]
It's been around a long time
Pimpin, manipulatin minds, prostitutin women
Pussy - is worth a lot of money
She says that everyday you gotta pay me when you want me
Tricks like to fuck and do that freaky shit
You know I kick my hoe ass, she don't bring me gifts
I'm talkin cold cash money, nothin else'll do
Get my money bitch you better fuck until he's through
Make that trick come quick, and don't stop him
And if he's slippin, you better rob him
Go out and turn another date, don't hesitate
You know daddy loves you when you keep my money straight
You ride the best cars, eat good, and drink fat
You can't do this shit without me don't you ever think that
Recognize my bald head and my gangsta limp
Damn it feels good to be a pimp

Chorus

[Too $hort]
I hear you squares, you try to criticize us players
but when the pussy's on sale I see you always there
A good customer, you know yo' game ain't tough
And even though we came up doin all the same stuff
I'm a pimp, I turn a bitch out quick
Have her standin on the corner tryin to get some dick
Lay on yo' back bitch, and get my cash
Cause if you don't, I gotta kick yo' ass
Fuck all that drama
This ain't HBO I whup you like yo' momma
if you don't pay me hoe, I do this everyday
I check bitches and get paid
I want the money I ain't tryin to get laid
Ain't nuttin new about this shit, it's the oldest profession
Sellin pussy while it's snowin at the coldest intersection
I know how you feel about me, you love me
Turnin tricks thinkin of me

Chorus

[Too $hort]
All the time..
