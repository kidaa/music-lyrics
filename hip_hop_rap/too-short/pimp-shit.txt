Verse 1: Too $hort
I was born to mack and at a young age
I knew I'd be a real pimp someday
So I practiced my walk, I studied the game
I never been a sucker but I was still lame
Some things never change but my game elevated
When it comes to pimpin hoes I been truly educated
Cause Im so slick, I make hoes turn tricks
Players University, class of '86
And I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho
I was 17 then and now I'm 34
I'ma still be a pimp till the day I die
On every street corner, and every high rise
I got the best women that money can buy
When I talk about the game, I never lie
Ask me why that lil girl made her momma cry
You wanna know I'll tell you why, nigga

Verse 2: Too $hort
She got lost and turned out at a young age
I knew she'd be a real ho someday
When she was 10, she was freaky back then
She would let the lil boys rub on her pants
She liked sittin on a grown mans lap
When she was 14, she let em fuck her from the back
For some scratch, she let em hit
Pull up her skirt, and lick on her clit
Lil fine ass bitch, with some big ol' tits
Made her first pimp rich with that good shit
But at the age of 26 she's an old ho
She don't really look that good no mo'
But she could make a trick cum in a minute
Anything you want you can get it
Anything you pay for, she'll earn
Give her some money, she'll take your sperm, nigga

Nothin but the hog in me nothin but the dog in me bitch
Niggas thats pimp shit pimp shit, yea, fa sho

Oh you know pimpin is the oldest profession

Verse 3: Too $hort
He used to give the girls his lunch money when he was young
For a kiss on the cheek, he thought it was fun
I knew he'd be a real trick one day
Lettin girls ride his bike, let 'em win when they play
He was soft, and females made him week
When you got no game, the only way to make a freak
Is to pay em, and thats what he grew up and did
He won't lie, ask him what he do for a bitch
Spend cash, just to get some ass
He tried to marry a ho, but the shit didn't last
He broke the golden rule, I hope he never tried
His own wife, own house, and he still had to die
Thats fucked up, but thats the life of a trick
Be a sucker for a bitch and she'll suck your dick
I know he loves her, I don't doubt him
She pulled out his money, said ";I love things about him";
