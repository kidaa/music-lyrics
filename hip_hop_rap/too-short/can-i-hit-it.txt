She's a BEITCH!  Say what, bitch?  Don't get it twisted
Sup with that little crazy man - it is what it is
Yeah, yeah - tryin to get with that mayne

[Too $hort]
You call that a dance?
Look like you fuckin the Invisible Man
I wanna put my hand - in between yo' legs, and grip it
Stick my finger in you, see if you with it
so I can hit it - know what I mean?
Freak nasty, all on my thing
I never seen nothin like that
I'm lookin at the cat - it's lookin back
But don't doubt me, cause when I put my mind to it
I take my time, I run a line through it
And what? Get up in them guts
I make you scream while I'm fuckin it up - beitch!

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick?
I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick beitch?

[Too $hort]
She's shakin that ass, but she ain't no whore
What is she? She's on the dancefloor wantin more
She's a freak Alcohol
She went to sit down and was about to fall
She's too drunk - but that's cool
I'm bout to take her to the old school
Big freakin yeah at the house drinkin yeah
I do this every weekend
And on the weekdays, I do the same thing
Gettin all this love that the game brings
I cain't sing - but my songs made me rich pimpin
Now watch me break this bitch!

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
I walked up to her, and said, ";Whassup?
I love the way you dance, I bet you can fuck";
That's when she blushed, I started spittin it
Give me two hours, I'll be hittin it up in it
Gettin it, while the gettin is good
I made her grab my dick, I knew she would
And when she felt it - it was on
She said, ";Take me home"; sure did
And two rubbers later, she was whipped whipped her
Forever my bitch
But don't trip - cause I ain't I ain't trippin
It's small things to a giant

[Chorus] - 0.75X
