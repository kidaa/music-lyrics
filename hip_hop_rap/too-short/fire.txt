[Erick Sermon]
Where my money at ho..
Where my money at yo..
Get my money 'fore I whip..
Forget your big fat ass
We going off baby
We don't mess around cuz I'm nautious baby
You know I loaded it with the gun, pop pop..
Aiyyo, LET'S GO!!!

Here we go y'all
New shit new shit, out the door y'all
Shorty Pimp, E-Dub once again
So buy you some of this ghetto slum
Underground music from A-T-L
X rearranged it, Shorty B played it
Me and Shorty laid it, my niggaz OKed it
Carnefious Crawfish, next to slay it
Damn right! We do it all day bitch
Ride around in Benz's, twenty inch rimzes
What Short told y'all, New York to California
We put them high beams on ya - parkin lot pimpin
With the boom-boom twelve inches kickin, we stay hittin
Huh? The most consecutive
Fifteen albums, we're the executives
Who talkin money?

[Hook - E. Sermon]
Let's do it baby
Me and Short dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shootin all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, E and Short be on fire!
Everything we do is fire!
This song is on fire! YO!

[Too $hort]
Bitch! That's my favorite word
I cashed a million dollar check on Thursday the third
Now it's flowin like water out the kitchen sink
I make more money everytime you blink
Got you scratchin ya head, made you stop and think
He couldn't made all that he must have robbed a Brinks
We been around so long, makin funky songs
Now you gettin mad, say this cain't be goin on
How come E and Short get to stay in the game?
Don't ever talk down on a player's name
So when you see us on top of every chart
You know we been number one since the very start
We feed families; when we rhyme, celebrate like champions
You see mine - I never worry
I don't want the stress, you know my story
I learned how to ball from the best

[Hook - E. Sermon]
Let's do it baby
Me and Short dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shootin all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, Eastcoast be on fire!
Westcoast be on fire!
Down south be on fire! YO!
Detroit, Chi-town!

[Erick Sermon]
Don't stop the song now I'm not over
I must leave the scene wrecked, before closure
Highest doja, L.A. weed
Monopolize the south like L.A. Reed BITCH!
Sick individual, this here be the southwest coast
Eastcoast material
Erick Sermon, that's what I said man
Fuck with Short and I and be a dead man

[Too $hort]
This is fire, pass it to me
It's so hot, E lemme hit that weed
Uptown, hydro is in my genes
It's like green, I just my be a fiend
Cuz I been tryin to O.D. lately
And your never gonna rehabilitate me
On a mission since the eigth grade
Keep gettin high, and stay paid

[Hook - E. Sermon]
Let's do it baby
Me and Short dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shootin all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, tonight is on fire!
The roof is on fire!
These hoes be on fire! ...
