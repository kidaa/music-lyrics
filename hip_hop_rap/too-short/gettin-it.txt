That's right, album number ten, Short Dawg's in the house
It's gettin close to the end y'all 
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album

Verse One: Too $hort

Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
in you ear for a minute, quit complaining
Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
you shoulf be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it aint funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnny Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him 
Get your kids in school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good, taking care of my folks
roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dawg in the house, I know you aint trippin
Cause Life is Too $hort you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life ain't long, for a young black man
Tryin to make money doing all he can
Sellin dope don't ya hope he would go to classB
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
with the twenties on top and the fifties on the bottom
I fuck the top notches oh yes we got em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin these funky sounds
Get your money man
Get yours

Chorus: P-Funk

You should be gettin it 
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
you should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good repeat as necessary

Verse Two: Too $hort

I know you tired of being broke just hanging out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set your self some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
and work hard, never stop hustlin
Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin
So what are you saying Todd?
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good
and you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand cause I know I can
I keep going and goin but I'm not the pink bunny
I'm not beatin on a drum I never stop thinkin money
I'm gettin all I can if you don't ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds

Chorus

I earned my respect in the street
 The ghetto's been good to me
 I'm never going to turn my back
 The true and living so I got to kick the facts
