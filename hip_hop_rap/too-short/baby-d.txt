Verse 1- *Baby D*

This is out fo dogs, wit tha fake attack,
I put it out two times, now I'm bringin it back,
wit a whole lot of me,

but it don't mean shit to me,
I'm the youngest in the Crew from the Oak-Town,
an when I come through, 
I lay you niggaz down,
so what up,
get yo gloves an stuff,
it's the Dangerous Crew, ain't no love fo punks,
an if you dont know what to do, when I come through,
let this young mack show you,
grab the mic, an tighten up yo lyrics,
if it ain't real, I ain't really tryin to hear it,
see another MC's gettin mad as hell,
ain't nuthin mo funky than to be himself,
I gotta make a knot,
while I shake the spot,
cuz I can't be stopped.

so get on,
