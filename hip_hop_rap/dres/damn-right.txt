So... so young.
Raped, but I don't realize.

Small white legs, broke,
the pain between her thighs

I see your pretty face,
Smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for?

Skin... so cold.
How, could someone steal a life?
Takes the blame.
Wait, I got some shit to say.

I see your pretty face,
Smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for?

Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for?

RAPE! Something... Now!
Rips my... Heart!
And takes... My!
Soul I... Wait
Too late... Now!
I feel... Hate!
Inside... Dark!
My soul away....

Away....

I see your pretty face,
Smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for?

Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for...
