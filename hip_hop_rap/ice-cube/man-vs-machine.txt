[Intro:]
Yo, we in a fight for our lives
we in a fight for our lives
and the trick thing about it
i dont know if we can win
and whats sad? i dont thing we WANNA win

[Verse 1:]
can you help me? a nigga need a job
im desperate, for some corn on the cob
im helpless, will i have to steal and rob?
no black? dinner so i got to ask bob
bob got a job but its done by a robot
no lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
more than a human being and its European,
ran by a Korean, American,
so there I am, surrounded by aluminum
theres no way you can run,
theres no way you can be,
its just and me, versus modern day machinery

[Chorus x2:]
its man vs machine baby
my heads in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[Verse 2:]
Im a fly caught in the web
a fish stuck in the internet
dont they know im a deathly catch?
eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
so what can I say to you?
im highly relatable and biodegradable
i thought we was unfadeable
slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
i dont need you to fuck 24/7
i guess that computer love
i dont need you to love
human contact aint what it used to was

[Chorus x2:]
its man vs machine baby
my heads in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[Outro x2:]
the whole world is automated
it need to be investigated
when people are eliminated
what we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies?
