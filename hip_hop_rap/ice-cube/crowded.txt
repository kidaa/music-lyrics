[Verse 1:]
This shit is crowded
When the whole place crowded, Im about it
And when a nigga is about it, dont doubt it
Ive got a pocket full of evil, gettin love from my people
You dont wanna see the sequel, if you see it
Everything you wanna be, Imma be it
Everything you wanna do, Imma do it
The best you ever smoked, I probably grew it
Im the fluid and I flow like the ocean
This chickens need lotion
Even use moisturizer need coachin
Im so West Coastin, Im so slow motion
Baby wanna put it in my face and crank it open
But baby, just put it in my pocket cause its open
And please stop hopin that a nigga is elopin
Cause I aint
Im goin straight to the bank
And if I have another drink it might be the whole tank

[Hook:]
This shit is crowded  Im buffaloing hoes
Im throwin bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded  Im buffaloing hoes
Im throwin bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded  Im buffaloing hoes
Im throwin bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded  Im buffaloing hoes
Im throwin bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded

[Verse 2:]
When the whole place crowded, Im about it
And when a nigga is about it, dont doubt it
I like it wet and sweaty
Hot as the Serengeti, bustin nuts, bustin cherries
And its on
It aint never, ever off
Unless youre talkin bout the fuckin lights in my loft
Unless youre talkin bout the fuckin Porsche pullin off
And niggas passin out when they smell that exhaust
And its on
I keep it turnt up and burnt up
When you gon learn? Im a head turner
Rich as Ted Turner, fuckin Tina Turner
Hope that concern ya, get the fuck out the way
Warriors, warriors, please come out and play
You cant keep up, we in the fuckin Milky Way
And when I come back, these niggas all better pray
It aint a good day, I might have my AK

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
For me, MC means move the crowd
For me, MC means move the crowd
For me, MC means move the crowd
For me, MC means move the crowd

[Verse 2:]
We packed  all together
Like sweaty ass cracks sweaty ass cracks
We packed  all together
Like sweaty ass cracks sweaty ass cracks
This shit is crowded
I see some of yall love it
You hope the chick in front of you might try to rub it
But slow the fuck down, cause your jeans are too hard
I dont go stupid, Im a retard
Im the one pushin when the crowd get to mushin
And if I stage dive  you my cushion
And when Im all about it, you can read all about it
Five in the shotty when Im in the building, and

[Hook]
